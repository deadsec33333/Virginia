</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aunt Louise holds a special place of honor on my Christmas card list this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s the last living aunt or uncle, for that matter — following the deaths of several family elders since the start of 2023. Aunt Lou is the Washington football franchise’s biggest fan, and the 96-year-old has the Commanders’ paraphernalia and knowledge of pigskin strategy to prove it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We snail mail cards to the homes of 90 relatives, longtime friends and journalism colleagues annually, sometimes with updates on the expanding careers of our adult children. Email missives and impersonal text chains just won’t do the trick for The Boss and me.</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2012/10/13/a-holiday-card-truly-from-the-heart-requires-paper-postage/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mailing cards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even with the ever-rising costs of stamps, has been a pleasant, longstanding ritual for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Christmas card list also represents an evolving microcosm of our lives and relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatives and friends who are now widowed dot the lineup. We acknowledge the deceased by supporting those still living and adapting to loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other spots, divorces mean we send out cards to different addresses where one previously sufficed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adult nieces and nephews — we have a bunch — now receive their own cards. Before, they were lumped in with their parents. How did one-time youngsters get so old, anyway?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve become more respectful of folks who aren’t Christian, be they Jews, Muslims, from other faiths or no faith at all. They get cards touting “Happy Holidays” and notes wishing them well in the season. I’m far from offended by this inclusive practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families with new children crop up on the list occasionally. That’s a rarity, though, since The Boss and I have attained AARP status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So consider this my special card to all of you, even if it doesn’t arrive in your mailbox: Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. May you have health, happiness and peace.</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="710" height="535" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jonas-Salk.jpeg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jonas-Salk.jpeg 710w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jonas-Salk-300x226.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Dr. Jonas Salk developed the polio vaccine, which has saved millions of lives. A simple story about a polio victim changed the writer’s mind. (Senator John Heinz History Center)

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember, when I was maybe just 5 years old, chewing a sugar cube to ward off a horrible, deadly disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My father was with me in the long line some 60 years ago as we fought polio,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/06/18/polio-vaccine-young-children-jfk/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an affliction that killed people or left them paralyzed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Polio was — and to a small extent, still is — generally contracted by exposure in water that had fecal matter in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were in a large auditorium or maybe a community center in Washington, D.C. My dad and I each gulped down a cube that contained a weakened version of the live virus. No shots, no pain, just sweets. (An earlier vaccine developed in the mid-1950s</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/06/18/polio-vaccine-young-children-jfk/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Dr. Jonas Salk required a series of injections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decades ago, polio survivors often had to use iron lungs to help them breathe. Photos of the bulky metal contraptions, to this impressionable child, suggested spherical torture chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polio is</span><a href="https://asm.org/articles/2024/september/polio-s-last-stand-the-global-fight-for-eradicatio" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly eradicated today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Children now usually get a polio vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months, and then a final dose at 4-6 years old, Dr. Leah Rowland, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, told me by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vaccine is “extremely effective, offering lifelong immunity of 99-100%,” Rowland said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Americans rarely even talk about polio nowadays is a testament to the vaccine’s effectiveness and acceptance. It’s a huge success story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why the possible elevation of vaccine critics</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/vaccines-protect-your-children-and-others-too/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/12/15/dave-weldon-trump-cdc-vaccine-skepticism/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Weldon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively, in a second Trump administration — is so alarming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If not outright insane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the chamber’s minority leader, is a polio survivor. He’s assailed Kennedy for seeking to rescind approval of the polio vaccine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed — they’re dangerous,” McConnell said in a statement, according to Politico. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People my age probably have vague recollections of the earlier, unusual sugar rush of the polio vaccine. Such memories should remain ephemeral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t, however, if misguided officials encourage conspiracy theories over proven vaccines. We don’t need a resurgence of diseases that are so easily preventable.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents in Virginia who don’t vaccinate their young children,</span> <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/11/20/school-vaccine-exemptions-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a percentage that’s grown over the past decade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are making a risky bet with their kids’ health – and maybe even their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a dangerous trend, perhaps attributable to the bleats of vaccine deniers who elevate misinformation, emotion and quackery over science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some adults may be unaware of past scourges where children frequently became ill before vaccines were available. Many decades ago, polio sufferers had to depend on metal apparatuses called</span> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1047691984/decades-after-polio-martha-is-among-the-last-to-still-rely-on-an-iron-lung-to-br" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iron lungs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just to help them breathe. Today, because of vaccines, polio is</span> <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/An-important-moment-in-the-fight-against-polio" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly eradicated worldwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and iron lungs are primarily an eerie part of my youthful subconscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccines work. More Americans should know that fact. Refusal of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic,</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250123" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">often along partisan lines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, makes the current challenge tougher.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/11/20/school-vaccine-exemptions-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios Richmond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently noted the number of parents in Virginia now opting out of getting their children vaccinated. It reported the percentage of kindergartners with vaccine exemptions has quadrupled over the past 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC statistics show 2.4%, or about 2,050 children out of 85,374 kindergartners in the commonwealth, had either medical or nonmedical vaccine exemptions in the 2023-24 school year. In 2014, that figure was 0.6%. (Nonmedical exemptions often involve religious reasons, though I suspect parents often cite them merely to refuse the injections.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s rate of exemptions was still below the national average of 3.3%, Axios reported. Parents nationwide also overwhelmingly support childhood vaccinations,</span> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/05/16/americans-largely-positive-views-of-childhood-vaccines-hold-steady/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Pew Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those positive facts could be altered, however, because</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is set to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under President-elect Donald Trump. Kennedy is a prominent anti-vaxxer and has been criticized as a</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/10/rfk-jr-faces-trouble-in-the-senate-00193579" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“denier of science.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s another example of Trump</span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/the-scandal-of-trumps-cabinet-picks-isnt-just-their-personal-failings" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">using his picks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to undermine the health and safety of everyday Americans, while at the same time awarding his sycophants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccine refusal disturbs epidemiologists like Carrie Dolan, an associate professor of kinesiology and public health at William &amp; Mary. She said the benefits of vaccines far, far outweigh the risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re effective,” Dolan told me. “They’re safe. They’re reliable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people aren’t vaccinated, she added, the chance for an infected person to spread a contagious disease to someone else increases. Getting a little wonky – at least for me – Dolan explained something called an</span><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“R0,” or basic reproduction number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measles has an R0 of 12 to 18, meaning one infected person could spread it to up to 18 others in an unvaccinated population, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before the vaccine, measles caused widespread outbreaks, often leading to complications like pneumonia and, in rare cases, brain swelling,” Dolan said by email. “Thanks to vaccination programs, measles cases have been drastically reduced worldwide. However, when vaccination rates drop, outbreaks can quickly return.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whooping cough, or pertussis, has an R0 of 12–17 and is especially dangerous for infants, who can have severe coughing fits that make breathing difficult. “Vaccination has greatly reduced the risk,” she said, but without it, “this disease could spread more easily, putting vulnerable groups like babies and the elderly at greater risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccinations also help protect children who, paradoxically, can’t take them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. John Harrington, a general pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, told me that young oncology patients chronically on steroids are “unlikely to mount a response” to certain vaccines. In those instances, vaccines could be harmful.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41481" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/vaccines-protect-your-children-and-others-too/harringtonjohn2015/" rel="attachment wp-att-41481"><img decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-41481" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/HarringtonJohn2015-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dr. John Harrington, general pediatrician at Children&#8217;s Hospital of The King&#8217;s Daughters in Norfolk, said vaccine-hesitant parents are often willing to listen to their doctors&#8217; advice about whether to get their children vaccinated. (Photo courtesy of CHKD)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The assumption is if everybody else is vaccinated, that protects” children with serious health problems, Harrington said. (This is also another way to define</span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22599-herd-immunity" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">herd immunity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccine-hesitant parents tend to have heard or seen things on the internet or social media that influence their thinking, he said. Many, though, are willing to listen to their pediatricians or primary care physicians about the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective, even if the total risk can’t be ruled out. Children are more likely to be protected, though, from diseases than if they hadn’t gotten the shots, Harrington said.</span></p>

	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erica Hunter, immunization data and outreach manager in the Virginia Department of Health,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">told me the recent trends on refusing vaccines for young children “certainly raise concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most Virginians do vaccinate their children,” Hunter said, adding she had no information on what role vaccine denialism might have in contributing to the statistics. “We just try to provide the best and most accurate information we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted the state’s Vaccines for Children program provides free immunizations and has done so for decades. “These viruses have not gone anywhere,” Hunter said. “They can resurface when vaccination rates decline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-COVID outbreaks have occurred in Virginia from time to time. For example, since June 2022,</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/meningococcal-disease-outbreak-response/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">41 confirmed cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of meningococcal disease associated with an outbreak of a specific bacterium have occurred. It killed eight people of all ages.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, 283 measles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases were reported this year through Dec. 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Virginia had one reported case. Some 89% of the total cases were listed as unvaccinated or unknown.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not vaccinating children exasperates Dolan, the Willam &amp; Mary epidemiologist. She helps run an immunization project in Kenya, and this summer, she had just 14 vaccines to fight HPV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 300 girls sought the precious supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In America, she said, we forget how lucky we are to have access to vaccines. “It’s been weaponized politically,” Dolan noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please vaccinate your children. Your actions will protect them and may help others, too.</span></p>

The casino opened in January 2023 with 57 table games, 24 poker tables and more than 1,400 slot machines. (Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joyce Jackson was eager to get inside the sprawling Rivers Casino Portsmouth on a recent weekday. Nor was she reticent to express her opinion about the full-scale gaming center that</span><a href="https://www.riverscasino.com/portsmouth/press/rivers-casino-portsmouth-celebrates-grand-opening" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">opened early last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s one of five casinos that’s already operating or being planned across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I love it!” said Jackson, 76, who lives in nearby Norfolk and visits the casino in Portsmouth at least twice a month. A large digital billboard on the building promoted the upcoming appearance of comedian</span><a href="https://www.riverscasino.com/portsmouth/entertainment/Tracy-Morgan" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracy Morgan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an alumnus of “Saturday Night Live” and “30 Rock.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just won a jackpot,” Jackson told me, explaining how she took home $2,600 during an earlier visit. “I like the one-armed bandit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her son Brian Smith, 51, was her designated chauffeur, and he dutifully stood by as I interviewed them in the parking lot. (Smith told me a few days later he plunked down $140 and won $500 from slot machines during that trip.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listening to Jackson, you could almost see the flashing lights, hear the canned jingling of coins and smell the restaurant fare. I did just that when I entered the casino – and promptly lost $10 on various slot machines, including video blackjack.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40897" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4130/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40897" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="2560" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-225x300.jpg 225w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_4130-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Double 7 jackpot is among the many slot machines customers can play at Rivers Casino Portsmouth.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, I enjoyed myself and will go back. It’s an entertaining diversion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what state legislators, casino advocates and many Virginians banked on when the commonwealth </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">finally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decided to take a chance on the industry. Well, that and a desire to tap a source of revenue that had bypassed the state for decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move to casino gambling in Virginia was long overdue. Localities, though, shouldn’t depend on gaming as their sole or chief revenue-generating strategy. People who study casinos say there’s only so much cash to go around, and the “new shiny toy” eventually loses its luster – especially given the myriad ways people can gamble nowadays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The explosion of online sports books is competing with physical casinos,” Bob McNab, a professor and chair of the Department of Economics at Old Dominion University, told me. “Let’s not forget the state lottery or games of skill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said there’s a two-hour “catchment” driving area that most gambling halls draw from if they’re not considered a “destination casino,” like in Las Vegas or Monaco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of the traffic is local,” McNab added. The host locality will reap more tax dollars, “but at the state level, you’re</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">really moving money from movies, restaurants and bars to casinos,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So there’s little net gain unless you can attract non-Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in 2015, when I wrote about the topic frequently for The Virginian-Pilot,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2015/10/27/putting-pamunkeys-federal-status-on-hold-deals-the-tribe-a-bad-hand/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">40 states had commercial or tribal casinos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2016/11/30/roger-chesley-maryland-will-reap-millions-from-virginians-with-opening-of-mgm-casino/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Paternalistic attitudes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among some legislators and congresspeople, plus concerns about protecting state lottery dollars, prevented passage of casino gaming. Virginians had to travel to Delaware, Maryland or elsewhere to get their fill – or fix, depending on your perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, thus, was one of the last states to welcome casinos when the General Assembly approved them in 2020 for five cities: Bristol, Danville, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Richmond. Residents, though, first had to approve the casinos in a referendum. (Petersburg </span><a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/petersburg-casino-appears-close-to-approval/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just joined the list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after Richmond voters said no last year.)</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40899" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/norfolk-casino-wide-shot/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40899 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Norfolk-Casino-Wide-Shot-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A rendering of the casino to be built in Norfolk, Virginia.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 42 states now have “land-based” gaming, a spokesperson with the American Gaming Association, an industry trade group, told me. That’s a lot of competition, yet many states – much like Virginia – eagerly welcome them. Eligible localities, including Portsmouth, have embraced the  opportunity:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/14/the-long-awaited-500-million-permanent-hard-rock-hotel-casino-holds-its-grand-opening-on-thursday/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The permanent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $500 million Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino </span><b>Bristol</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at the former Bristol Mall, opened last week. A temporary casino had opened in July 2022, the first one to operate in the state. The staff will eventually total 1,400, according to news accounts.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caesars Virginia in </span><b>Danville </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently announced it will open doors to its permanent casino next month. Caesars and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians</span><a href="https://www.wnct.com/news/southeast-region/virginia-casino-resort-about-60-miles-from-durham-schedules-date-for-grand-opening/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">opened a temporary casino in May 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The site is just 60 miles from Durham, so its catchment area actually includes residents in North Carolina. The $750 million casino resort will host the first Virginia restaurant of noted</span><a href="https://newsroom.caesars.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Celebrated-Multi-Michelin-Starred-Chef-Gordon-Ramsay-Brings-First-Restaurant-to-Virginia-with-Arrival-of-Ramsays-Kitchen-at-Caesars-Virginia/default.aspx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">chef-scold Gordon Ramsay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oft-delayed casino in downtown </span><b>Norfolk</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held a</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/10/30/norfolk-casino-breaks-ground-on-750-million-project/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ceremonial groundbreaking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Oct. 30. The $750 million project includes a 200-room hotel, food and beverage outlets and a casino with 1,500 slots and 50 table games scheduled to open in 2027. A temporary facility should open in late 2025, a casino spokesman told me. The Virginian-Pilot reported the project has shrunk since it was first announced by the Pamunkey tribe, which is a partner with Boyd Gaming. Norfolk voters approved the project in 2020. The development partner has changed</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/09/08/norfolk-casino-plans-have-evolved-heres-how-todays-plans-compare-with-previous-proposals/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">since plans were originally released in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li><b>Petersburg </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters this month</span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/the-tri-cities/petersburg-moves-forward-with-1-4-billion-casino-after-voter-approval/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">overwhelmingly supported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a proposed $1.4 billion casino project. More than 80% backed it. Petersburg weighed in after voters in</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/24/petersburg-doubles-down-on-cordish-as-its-casino-operator/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearby Richmond twice rejected casino proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All this casino action comes with a huge caveat: It’s likely to cause more gambling addiction. Carolyn Hawley, an addiction expert and professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, told me states and localities should factor in the potential loss to individuals of productivity in their jobs, health problems, stress and family discord.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, because there’s no federal funding for gambling studies, Hawley said, not much research is being done. “We just don’t know what the ramifications are going to be,” said Hawley, who’s also president of the Virginia Council on Problem Gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we do know is that even if Virginia didn’t host casinos, residents here would gamble in nearby states – think of the huge MGM National Harbor casino just across the Potomac River in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Or, Virginians would ante up while on their smartphones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the state should collect gaming dollars if it’s going to have to also fight gaming-related problems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile,</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/virginia-sees-big-tax-bump-from-sports-betting-and-casinos/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a September 2023 Virginia Mercury story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted gaming was outperforming previous state projections, even though several casino sites were in temporary buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temporary Bristol casino gained $157 million in net gambling revenue in its first year of operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temporary Caesars casino in Danville had $31 million in gambling revenue in May and June 2023. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/01/23/rivers-casino-portsmouth-generates-250m-in-revenue-15m-in-city-taxes-in-first-full-year/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A news article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said the Portsmouth casino generated nearly $250 million in gaming revenue in its first full year. It provided the city of Portsmouth with more than $15 million in tax revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These welcome statistics might not continue for individual cities and counties after all five casinos in Virginia are operating, attendance tapers off and if gambling-related addictions rise dramatically. Localities can’t afford to view gaming as a panacea for their budgets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A healthy dose of skepticism is warranted to rationally discuss how casinos can help (and hinder) economic development,” ODU’s 2021 State of the Commonwealth report noted about the then-fledgling industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Experience in the gambling industry shows that, after the novelty has worn off, casino revenue tends to plateau, if not outright decline,” the report added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s enjoy ourselves at the roulette wheel, poker table and slot machines. Let’s gamble wisely, within budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And let’s tell our local officials and state legislators that gaming is just one of many tools to raise money – and to keep searching for others.</span></p>

At a rally just before Election Day, he placed journalists in the cross-hairs, at least figuratively.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-says-he-wouldnt-mind-if-someone-shot-journalists/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump told rallygoers in Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it wouldn’t bother him if someone shot the reporters there covering the event. He had mentioned an opening between the panels of bulletproof glass; Trump had faced an assassination attempt during a July rally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news, and I don’t mind that so much,” Trump told the crowd. Folks there laughed and shouted howls of approval. Nothing like bloodshed, I suppose, to satisfy the masses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an eight-week period before the election, Trump verbally attacked the media more than 100 times,</span><a href="https://rsf.org/en/usa-trump-verbally-attacked-media-more-100-times-run-election" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporters Without Borders noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That total didn’t even include social media posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s recently called journalists</span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-attack-media-news-lawsuit-fox-news-journalists-first-amendment/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“monsters” and “horrible, horrible, dishonest people.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (That’s rich coming from the guy who</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-fact-checker-tracked-trump-claims/2021/01/23/ad04b69a-5c1d-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lied or otherwise uttered misleading statements more than 30,000 times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his first term.) He sued CBS News some $10 billion for its editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris, though such editing is commonplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disabuse yourself of the notion these are merely routine comments by Trump,</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/what-happens-to-trump-criminal-cases/index.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the nation’s only convicted felon to be voted commander in chief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Doesn’t he do this all the time? Sure. Have such statements ever </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led to harm? Well …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circumstances are different now, since he’ll have sycophants and</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/11/06/whats-next-trump-presidency-policy-changes/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">supreme loyalists staffing his second administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s not like the first term, when he often faced pushback from top advisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we all witnessed – in real time and shocking video footage – </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/politics/fact-check-trump-january-6/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how he incited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a failed insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s oft-unhinged rantings matter. His fervent followers could take a directive to attack reporters as a call to (fire)arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is exactly the point. He wants journalists looking over their shoulders and focusing on would-be attackers, rather than writing forcefully about Trump’s leadership – including its deficiencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we’ve learned one thing about Trump and contemporary authoritarians, we have to take them at their word,” Bruce Shapiro, executive director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma at Columbia University, told me in an interview. “Making the press the enemy of the people is central to the MAGA project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president-elect’s words “give permission to people in his movement” to assault others, Shapiro added. “It’s not mere bombast when a ‘joke’ is part of a movement that valorizes violence, that declares people ‘the enemies from within.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may sound far-fetched to you. But as a member of the profession constantly under siege by a politician who wouldn’t accept his 2020 defeat, and who sees </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criticism as a reason to erupt, I don’t take these attacks lightly. Nor do my colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes a toll on the journalists” who cover the president, Shapiro said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit group based in New York City, reported recently that Trump has mulled strengthening libel laws, weakening First Amendment protections and prosecuting reporters for critical coverage. For a man willing to excoriate anyone, and who wields such a huge megaphone, he has notoriously thin skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalists face this onslaught at a time of shrinking newsroom budgets, fewer local reporters and the</span><a href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/projects/state-of-local-news/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">closing of many publications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around the country, CPJ noted. Its interviews with journalists, lawyers, and press freedom advocates “found that media workers are confronting challenges that include an increased risk of </span><a href="https://cpj.org/2023/05/man-fires-shot-at-memphis-television-station/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://pressfreedomtracker.us/blog/members-of-the-press-charged-with-committing-acts-of-journalism-in-2023/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arrest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on- and offline </span><a href="https://cpj.org/2023/08/this-kind-of-behavior-cannot-be-tolerated-police-raid-on-kansas-newspaper-alarms-media-press-freedom-groups/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harassment,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legal battles, and </span><a href="https://cpj.org/2023/10/alabama-publisher-reporter-arrested-charged-with-disclosing-leaked-information/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminalization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Simon, director of the Journalism Protection Initiative at the Graduate School of Journalism at City University of New York, noted Trump’s bombast is often used to draw attention to himself, rather than issues that have greater importance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The language can be “incredibly menacing and threatening,” Simon told me, but it also “can be used to manipulate coverage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s incredibly destructive,” Simon said. “But I don’t think it’s causing journalists to cover him in a different way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatively few journalists in this country over the past 50 years have been slain because of the stories they were covering, but it does happen. Victims include my onetime associate</span><a href="https://chaunceybaileyproject.org/2011/06/10/chauncey-bailey-murder-justice-has-finally-been-done/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chauncey Bailey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who worked at the competing daily newspaper in Detroit when we both were reporters there. We chatted about the craft, and we often played basketball together.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://chaunceybaileyproject.org/2011/06/09/commentary-chauncey-bailey-verdict-brings-long-awaited-justice/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey was gunned down in 2007 in downtown Oakland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while walking to work. He had been reporting on a story about financial problems at a business called Your Black Muslim Bakery. A coalition of local media formed the Chauncey Bailey Project to investigate the death and the police handling of the killing. Eventually, three men were sentenced to prison in the case.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/nx-s1-5155054/las-vegas-reporter-murder-official-sentenced" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff German</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an investigative reporter at the Las Vegas Review-Journal, was stabbed to death in September 2022. He had reported on a hostile workplace environment in the office of Robert Telles, a then-elected official. Telles was sentenced last month to at least 28 years in prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump doesn’t need to know reporters personally, but he can still place their lives at risk. His own statements could “nudge” any one of his followers nationwide to commit violence against journalists. He’d also enjoy some plausible deniability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump, one of the most reckless presidents in U.S. history, is rushing headlong into fascism. He enjoys a pliant, spineless Republican Party. After the House of Representatives impeached Trump over Jan. 6, GOP senators whom he placed in jeopardy that day refused to convict him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He benefits from an overtly partisan Supreme Court majority.</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-trump-capitol-riot-immunity-2dc0d1c2368d404adc0054151490f542" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It blessed his attempts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this summer to gain broad immunity from prosecution related to his plot to overturn the 2020 election. It was a shocking ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My colleagues in the Fourth Estate are one of the few lines of defense left. We’re willing to say when Trump is wrong, lying or violating the Constitution. It’s why the Narcissist-in-Chief has placed a target on our backs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s no accident.</span></p>

Daylight hours shorten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scam artists also descend like locusts upon unsuspecting seniors who are changing coverage options during</span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/what-to-know-about-the-medicare-open-enrollment-period-and-medicare-coverage-options/#:~:text=The%20annual%20Medicare%20open%20enrollment%20period%20runs%20from%20October%2015,st%20of%20the%20following%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Medicare open enrollment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which runs from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7. The only difference from the insects? Pesky scammers strike every year, with nary a respite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare is the government-sponsored health insurance program for</span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/cms-guide-medical-technology-companies-and-other-interested-parties/getting-started/overview-medicare" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people ages 65 and older</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as for those under 65 with specific disabilities. President Lyndon Johnson signed the legislation establishing Medicare (and Medicaid) into law in 1965.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AARP Virginia recently alerted seniors that Medicare con artists are back at it. Frankly, I doubt they ever lay dormant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Medicare scams spike during open enrollment season with criminals posing as insurance providers calling and emailing about free gifts or limited-time offers,”</span><a href="https://states.aarp.org/virginia/aarp-virginia-fraud-alert-medicare-open-enrollment-scams#:~:text=Be%20suspicious%20and%20don't,an%20existing%20relationship%20with%20them" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the nonprofit organization said in a news release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “These scams are all designed to steal your money, Medicare information, or your identity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t share sensitive personal information with anyone who calls, emails or visits promoting a Medicare plan. “Legitimate Medicare plans can only contact you if you’ve requested information or if you have an existing relationship with them,” the release added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seniors are inundated with ads” this time of year, said Jane Constantineau, marketing director for Senior Services of Southeastern Virginia. Elderly Virginians often are looking for help to navigate their options, but that sometimes leaves them vulnerable to individuals and</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/17/world/asia/myanmar-cyber-scam.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">scam labor camps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, often overseas, trying to cash in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin Bailey volunteers with AARP Virginia, giving anti-fraud presentations to seniors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Scammers can ‘spoof’ a phone number,” Bailey told me.</span><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/spoofing" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Spoofing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means your caller ID picks up numbers that disguise where the call is actually coming from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t recognize the call, let it go to voicemail, he advised. Scammers don’t usually waste their time leaving a message. Even when they do, Bailey said, don’t return the message: Find another listing for the so-called company, and dial that number to see whether it’s real.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you receive a text message on your phone from unknown senders, don’t click on the attached links. They could download a virus on your device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why do con artists go through all this trouble and subterfuge? “Money,” Bailey said simply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Trade Commission’s</span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/reports/consumer-sentinel-network-data-book-2023" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer Sentinel Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> collects information about problems that Americans encounter for all types of fraud, not just Medicare.</span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/CSN-Annual-Data-Book-2023.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The data book for 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released earlier this year, tallied 2.6 million fraud reports costing $10.3 billion in total losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The median loss was $500. People ages 70 and over, though, had a higher median loss compared to younger Americans. Imposter scams and identity theft in government benefit programs were key areas of monetary losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia ranked ninth-highest among the states in fraud reports per 100,000 people. The commonwealth had nearly 98,000 incidents, and Virginia reported $205 million in losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A FTC spokesman told me that in 2023, the agency received 743 reports from Virginians of suspected Medicare imposters. Four people reported losses totaling $63,680.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various news articles suggest</span><a href="https://wvpublic.org/medicare-fraud-costs-taxpayers-creates-problems-for-seniors/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare loses $60 billion annually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fraud nationwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This topic is personal to me because I turn 65 this year. I’m officially old. My thinning hair and arthritic knees had already been clues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to delve into my Medicare options after decades of employer-sponsored health care. The different parts of</span><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (A, B and D, plus Advantage or supplemental) can be confusing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You would’ve thought, however, that I’d advertised my date of birth. I received dozens of unsolicited – and sketchy – phone calls this year. Many came to my cell phone with the note, “Spam Risk.” Here are just two. (I answered them, in part, because I figured they would be fodder for a future column.)</span></p>
<p><b>April 18</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Call originates from an 804 area code, supposedly)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caller: I’m Christina at the Health Care Center.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me: What city and state are you in?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Click.)</span></p>
<p><b>April 23</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caller: I’m Olivia. I’m calling from the Healthcare Information Center. We’re calling with the latest Medicare info.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Me: Olivia, where is the center located?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Click. Why is that question a problem if the caller is legit?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can Virginians do to protect themselves?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One resource is the</span><a href="https://virginiasmp.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Senior Medicare Patrol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a grant-funded program from the feds that helps protect against and detect Medicare fraud and abuse. It does outreach and education. Call 800-938-8885. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The patrols are in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also find a wealth of information at</span><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">medicare.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Are you more comfortable talking to a program representative one-on-one? Then call 1-800-633-4227. The site is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, except for some federal holidays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protect yourself. Don’t get cheated. Prevent scammers from cashing in at your expense – and the government’s.</span></p>

(Chris McGrath/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s so simple – and soooo seductive – to sign up for offers touting cheap “teaser” rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what I mean: Just $10 for a gym membership for three months. Or a free trial period from retail-order conglomerates. Online news websites are fond of introductory fees of, say,</span><a href="https://subscribe.nola.com/defaultnolanding?ofrgp_id=161&amp;g2i_source=festivals" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 for six months</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem comes when the trial period ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers often don’t track or remember the date when the discounted rate ceases. Their credit cards automatically get billed with the higher fees. The densely laden “terms and conditions” section they clicked on earlier may explain how tough it is to cancel – but who reads all that lengthy gibberish?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, a new Virginia law that took effect July 1 forces companies – if you sign up for a 30-day free trial – to inform you about cancellation options before they actually ding your credit cards,</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/10/04/virginia-cancel-subscription-reminder-free-trials" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del.</span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+mbr+H340" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Lopes Maldonado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Prince William, sponsored</span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb744" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that got overwhelming support in both chambers this year. Gov. Glenn Youngkin then signed it into law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a ‘gotcha moment’” when subscriptions automatically renew, Maldonado told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not just individuals who get caught up in this. Small businesses might have licensing agreements” that are similarly onerous, she said, adding that the legislation is part of her ongoing consumer protection efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raheel Sheikh, a Northern Virginia businessman, reached out to Maldonado after receiving costly automatic renewal charges from a website maintenance firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislation puts some responsibility on the vendors,” he said. “All the responsibility was on the consumers.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/some-states-including-virginia-want-to-make-it-easier-to-cancel-subscriptions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury noted last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the commonwealth is one of several states that have enacted similar measures. The laws give more protection to people previously flummoxed by abruptly rising automatic charges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of us – with jobs, children to feed and busy lifestyles – simply lose track of all that we’ve signed up for online and elsewhere. A survey of 2,343 adults in March</span><a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/subscription-creep-costs-us-consumers-more-than-1000-a-year-cnet-survey-finds/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by CNET</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a consumer-oriented website, found 48% of respondents said they’d signed up for a free trial of a paid subscription, and then simply forgotten to cancel it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s about time consumers got more help against these expensive costs and shady business practices.</span></p>

Recently, a Chesterfield County judge sided with that locality’s police department in refusing a citizen’s request to reveal the names and salaries of hundreds of its officers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling occurred despite</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter37/section2.2-3705.1/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a section in the Code of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> providing access to records “of the name, position, job classification, official salary, or rate of pay” of public employees. Andrew Bodoh, the attorney who sought the release of information for his client, told me this part of state law should’ve resolved potential conflicts with other code portions involving FOIA.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-courts/chesterfield-police-trial-secrecy-undercover/article_e3cce33a-7cff-11ef-b273-efce26f17906.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported the Chesterfield police department had redacted the names of nearly every officer on the force. The agency had said that all 521 officers below the rank of lieutenant could go “undercover” at any  time in his or her career, which is why the names should remain secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More on that novel reasoning later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bodoh, who specializes in FOIA cases, said the case will be appealed to the Virginia Court of Appeals. A similar case from Hanover County Circuit Court, involving access to information on sheriff’s department deputies there, will be heard at the appellate court.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1oQkEelGkz"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/05/foia-friday-nottoways-new-county-administrator-hanover-officer-info-stays-shielded/">FOIA Friday: Nottoway’s new county administrator, Hanover officer info stays shielded</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;FOIA Friday: Nottoway’s new county administrator, Hanover officer info stays shielded&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/05/foia-friday-nottoways-new-county-administrator-hanover-officer-info-stays-shielded/embed/#?secret=TcUhPmTJqv#?secret=1oQkEelGkz" data-secret="1oQkEelGkz" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bodoh said there’s an obvious public interest in obtaining the names of people who are stopping citizens and making arrests. Residents should also know how much officers are being paid and whether those amounts are “fiscally responsible, as well,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course we should. Bringing that information to light could curb nepotism and favoritism within local government, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County Attorney Jeffrey Mincks, who defended the police department in court, did not return my calls or emails requesting comment about the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bodoh represents Richmond resident Alice Minium, the founder and director of</span><a href="https://openoversightva.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenOversightVA.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The website bills itself as “a public, searchable database of law-enforcement officers” in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minium started her information-gathering following the racial justice protests that occurred when</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Minneapolis police killed George Floyd in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. During demonstrations in Richmond, Minium told me, police officers often wouldn’t identify themselves to protesters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are trying to get from their mouths who is on their payroll and who is policing us,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 342 law-enforcement agencies around Virginia have provided information that her organization had sought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only Hanover and Chesterfield refused her requests.</span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/minium-v-hines-hanover-circuit-court" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover had utilized the same general defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about secrecy for undercover cops that Chesterfield later adopted. “The entire rest of the state acts like this is a given,” Minium noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes you ask: What good is FOIA if you can’t get such basic information? If the appellate court sides with the lower ones, that could be a harbinger of even more state secrecy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judges in Hanover and Chesterfield seemed hung up over whether “undercover officers” and “plainclothes officers” were the same thing. Generally, undercover officers are possibly impersonating someone else while investigating crimes – drug sales, illegal guns and prostitution, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plainclothes officers can be homicide or major crimes detectives who don’t usually wear uniforms. They aren’t trying to fool citizens about who they are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a fundamental distinction between a plainclothes officer, who’s prepared to disclose identification to enforce the law, to an undercover officer” using an alias, attorney Bodoh said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In turning over the roster, though, undercover officers wouldn’t use their aliases. So what are departments trying to protect? After all, an occasional undercover cop who also patrols should give his </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> name and badge number when pulling someone over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor could I find instances where an undercover officer’s ID was revealed by news outlets or public-disclosure advocates that led to injury or death. Bodoh and Megan Rhyne, executive director for the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, said they weren’t aware of any incidents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the personnel lists and salaries is “a basic measure of accountability,” Rhyne told me. “… We don’t have secret police forces.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia needs to stop treating its citizens like bad stepchildren&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/09/11/virginia-needs-to-stop-treating-its-citizens-like-bad-stepchildren/embed/#?secret=Yukza5nLID#?secret=46tCigXLQ5" data-secret="46tCigXLQ5" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This issue would be moot if public agencies in Virginia, including police departments, released more info about investigations and their decision-making process in the first place.</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/09/11/virginia-needs-to-stop-treating-its-citizens-like-bad-stepchildren/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As I’ve written previously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many disseminate only what’s mandated. They routinely withhold what’s discretionary – often to the point of absurdity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This posture reveals a certain contempt for the press and the public in Virginia, especially at a time when so many newspapers in the state have closed or jettisoned staff members. Northwestern’s Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2023/12/04/virginias-newspaper-decline" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported Virginia had lost 23 local newspapers from 2005 to 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents have tried to pick up some of the slack by filing FOIA requests. That’s especially critical when the details involve local government, police and school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope the state appeals court will provide clarity that bolsters the state’s FOIA. The shame is justices have to rule on something public agencies should do willingly.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin keeps playing lapdog to Donald Trump. The former president’s lies about the subject have earned tacit support from Youngkin and other Republican officials in the run-up to the November election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They all know better. Shame on them for placating</span><a href="https://www.commoncause.org/press/in-major-setback-for-democracy-insurrectionist-is-allowed-to-stay-on-ballot/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an insurrectionist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-trial-deliberations-jury-testimony-verdict-85558c6d08efb434d05b694364470aa0" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">convicted felon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and someone whose</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/17/covid-19-us-400-000-deaths-experts-blame-trump-administration/6642685002/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">incompetent response to the COVID-19 pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember this: Trump was so incensed that he lost the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">popular</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016 that he embarked on a</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/05/17/voter-fraud-trumps-electoral-commission-is-the-real-fraud/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">discredited quest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to uncover millions of undocumented immigrants who “all voted for Hillary,” he claimed. Trump’s biased commission ended with a whimper,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2018/01/05/voter-fraud-panel-was-a-sham-time-to-focus-on-real-challenges-of-security-access/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">after states refused to comply with the panel’s intrusive requests for voter data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and opponents complained the panel wasn’t open with the public about its work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hesitated to write this column because it gives more oxygen to a lie about voting by noncitizens. Some noxious statements, though, must be repudiated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This lie is just the latest from the Republican Party, as it provides a ready excuse for Trump if he loses a second straight election. GOP leaders are priming the pump for chaos if Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris wins.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin recently signed an executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> codifying “election security” measures that were already in place in the commonwealth. He noted the state Department of Elections had removed 6,303 noncitizens from the voter rolls between January 2022 and July 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump then praised Youngkin</span><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112922950918796711" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for “securing” November’s election in the state. By the way, Republican nominees haven’t carried Virginia since George W. Bush in 2004 – and Trump has already lost Virginia twice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No mention was made in the guv’s executive order of how many immigrants had purposely voted illegally, or whether some were confused and didn’t know it was against the law. I sought answers from the governor’s office, but a Youngkin spokesman didn’t return my calls and emails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know, among other things, why Youngkin signed the executive order just months before the November election, and why he didn’t say how many of those thousands of people actually tried to vote. Were any charged with a crime?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers, including Trump, have lied repeatedly that illegal immigrants are overrunning the polls. That’s simply not the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans know this, yet keep fanning the flames. We all saw how deceitfulness like that incited an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider this:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">         </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by the Heritage Foundation – the folks behind the ultraconservative, government-gutting</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-is-project-2025-trump-conservative-blueprint-heritage-foundation/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> –</span><a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/four-things-to-know-about-noncitizen-voting/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">found just 24 cases of noncitizens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voting between 2003 and 2023. That’s an infinitesimal amount compared to the total number of votes cast.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">       </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-immigrants-noncitizen-trump-republicans-2024-1c65429c152c2a10514b5156eacf9ca7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported that Georgia officials in 2022 audited the state’s voter rolls looking for noncitizens. Some 1,634 had tried to register to vote over a period of 25 years,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">but election officials caught all the applications; none actually registered.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">         </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In North Carolina in 2016,</span><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/sboe/Post-Election%20Audit%20Report_2016%20General%20Election/Post-Election_Audit_Report.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an audit found 41 legal immigrants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – not yet citizens – cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total votes. Not surprisingly, the votes made no difference in the results in any of the state’s elections.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">         </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The progressive</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/noncitizen-voting-missing-millions" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Brennan Center for Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> studied the prevalence of noncitizen voting, too. “Across 42 jurisdictions, election officials who oversaw the tabulation of 23.5 million votes in the 2016 general election referred only an estimated 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting for further investigation or prosecution,” it said. “[I]improper noncitizen votes accounted for 0.0001 percent of the 2016 votes in those jurisdictions.”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your family wasted money at those minuscule rates, you’d be euphoric.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alice Clapman, Washington-based senior counsel for voting rights at the Brennan Center, told me Youngkin’s executive order feeds disinformation about voter fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s a disturbing pattern,” she said. Similar announcements have occurred recently in other states with Republican governors, including</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/louisiana-noncitizens-voting-87e6199c8792eba4746ffabcf0d9f8a8" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.sos.texas.gov/about/newsreleases/2024/081224-2.shtml" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The number of actual instances of noncitizen voting is vanishingly rare,” Clapman said, adding there’s a distinction between such people who register to vote, but then realize they can’t do so legally and stay away from the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clapman also noted that it would be extremely risky for noncitizens to cast ballots. They could be imprisoned and deported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Youngkin has zero credibility on the issue of voting security and administration. He’s chosen partisanship over good governance repeatedly since taking office in early 2022.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/11/10/maybe-now-we-can-lay-the-election-integrity-talk-to-rest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He played coy during the gubernatorial party nomination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> process about whether he agreed Joe Biden won the 2020 election – a litmus test for Trump supporters. He participated in a discredited</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/08/12/28460/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “election integrity” rally in Lynchburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s elections commissioner pulled Virginia out of what had been an</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-joins-republican-states-pulling-out-of-multi-state-voter-list-program/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">uncontroversial, multistate program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to share accurate voter rolls known as the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, after it was targeted</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/after-eric-withdrawal-virginia-strikes-deals-with-6-states-to-share-voter-data/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by conservative activists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and conspiracy theorists. The decision emboldened partisan hacks and quacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman with the state Department of Elections told me his agency has “gained access to substantially more data to use in updating voter lists” since leaving ERIC. It now receives data from 42 states about voters who may have moved, compared to 25 states before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change, however, is a classic case of reinventing the wheel, because there was nothing wrong with ERIC in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also has reversed the ease</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/05/mississippi-ruling-reflects-virginias-history-of-felon-voter-disenfranchisement/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with which former felons could regain the right to vote in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We remain among the toughest states to do so nationwide, hewing to a state Constitution clause that’s racist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States run by Republican governors, including Virginia, have made a lot of noise about one of Trump’s favorite talking points – noncitizen voting. It’s not a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and others shouldn’t bestow their imprimatur to someone who constantly lies – and stokes fear – to try to regain power. It’s dangerous.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville city officials say they have no plans to roust homeless individuals from the well-known Downtown Mall pedestrian area, despite complaints from some business owners that the latter’s presence affects the “safety” and “cleanliness” of the area and they should be rounded up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a super complex issue,” city spokeswoman Afton Schneider told me. “It’s not one that can be easily fixed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank goodness compassion has prevailed, at least for now, over punishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The callousness calls to mind </span><a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/christmascarol/quotes/character/bob-cratchit/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ebenezer Scrooge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refusing Bob Cratchit a lump of coal in winter. Or demanding folks pull themselves up by their bootstraps — when they don’t even have shoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that the presence of homeless people and the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">related panhandling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could impede retail sales. Folks strolling along the Mall might feel threatened, or at least annoyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to remember, though, why some 200 homeless people in Charlottesville and five nearby counties have to survive this way: Many have faced medical emergencies, job terminations or other cash-sucking calamities. Affordable housing is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/15/continued-lack-of-affordable-housing-hinders-pride-security-among-virginians/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CApproximately%2029%20percent%20of%20Virginia,said%20in%20a%202021%20report."><span style="font-weight: 400;">at a premium in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Demand has outstripped supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And sadly,</span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-04-17/most-homeless-americans-are-battling-mental-illness#:~:text=%22The%20most%20common%20mental%20disorders,on%20homelessness%20and%20mental%20illness." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an estimated two-thirds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of those who survive on the streets worldwide suffer from some form of mental illness, according to a review of 85 studies published this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing is going to change if barriers still exist to get into housing,” Shayla Washington, executive director of the Blue Ridge Area Coalition for the Homeless, told me Thursday.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/local-agencies-shock-city-council-members-with-latest-data-on-the-number-of-folks-experiencing-homelessness/#:~:text=The%202023%20PIT%20count%20was,it%20at%20any%20given%20time." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville Tomorrow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/business/people-are-afraid-charlottesville-businesses-call-on-city-to-round-up-homeless/article_401e266e-55bc-11ef-83a6-a7ff6d61d011.html#tracking-source=mp-homepage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The (Charlottesville) Daily Progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have covered homelessness closely in the city of 45,000 residents. Challenges there are often duplicated </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in communities across the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including Norfolk, Virginia Beach and Fairfax County. Some localities have adopted a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/newest-anti-homeless-project-builds-on-strong-efforts-statewide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Housing First” model</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides shelter as quickly as possible and then offers needed social services and counseling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Progress recently reported the mayor and police chief met with business leaders in late June about the issue at the Downtown Mall. Some businesspeople suggested the police more aggressively monitor and expel the homeless. They cited a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling in </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-175_19m2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grants Pass v. Johnson</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that said local ordinances with penalties for camping on public land do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, even if homeless people have nowhere else to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police chief in Charlottesville, though, said the city doesn’t have such an ordinance to enforce. Then, at an Aug. 5 City Council meeting, several residents and homeless advocates publicly opposed the “inhumane” rhetoric and lock-’em-up mentality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That vocal repudiation was justified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A petition organized by Friends of Cville Downtown suggested more resources be identified to help people who don’t have a roof over their heads, the newspaper said. Among them: a free public health clinic; an overnight shelter with fewer hurdles to admission; and a designated campsite with bathroom, showers and storage units. It was a turnaround from an original draft that was punitive toward people living on the streets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor is it clear how much of an effect the presence of the unhoused has on Mall sales. Dueling statistics appeared in the recent article. Washington, the homeless advocate, pointed out that many shops there are niche or boutique retailers, which might limit customers. Inflation could impact sales, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think homelessness is the only target for their businesses being affected,” she added.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39644" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39644" rel="attachment wp-att-39644"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39644 size-large" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DC-homeless-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Members of a clean-up crew remove belongings that have been left behind by occupants as the National Park Service clears the homeless encampment at McPherson Square on Feb. 15, 2023 in Washington, D.C.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s clear is the Charlottesville area isn’t the </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/park-service-dc-police-clear-foggy-bottom-homeless-encampments/3617977/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">District of Columbia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where federal and local agencies have repeatedly cleared out large homeless encampments. In May, workers shut down several sites affecting scores of people in the nation’s capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That city tallied more than </span><a href="https://community-partnership.org/homelessness-in-dc/facts-and-figures/?_sft_resource_topic=recent" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5,600 homeless individuals during its annual Point-in-Time Count in January</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a total that dwarfs the numbers in localities around Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The District’s Encampment Response Team was activated to protect residents on District property after dangerous circumstances arose, including fires, danger of traffic collisions, multiple assaults, and growing rodent issues,” a city statement said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an extreme stance, one that should be avoided if possible. Also, just because officials destroy tents and makeshift living spaces, that doesn’t mean the folks who had slept there suddenly have other places to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why long-term, well-planned solutions are needed. Some ideas come from groups like Virginia Supportive Housing (VSH), a nonprofit developer that operates 11 residential communities around the state. They include one in Charlottesville known as The Crossings, which has 60 apartments and opened in 2012.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VSH and the Piedmont Housing Alliance want to build 140 affordable residential units in nearby Albemarle County called Premier Circle, but a </span><a href="https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/as-chronic-homelessness-rises-in-the-charlottesville-area-one-type-of-housing-that-can-help-has-been-delayed-because-of-rising-construction-costs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous news report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said work stalled because of higher estimated costs. Construction could begin late this year, a VSH spokeswoman told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re very, very excited for this project to get underway,” said Kate McCarthy, a spokesperson for VHS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These efforts, though, can take years. That’s also true when city governments take the lead in opening overnight, multipurpose shelters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During my time at The Virginian-Pilot, </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2011/11/15/beach-should-move-quickly-with-homeless-campus-plans/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I engaged in a very public debate with municipal officials in Virginia Beach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who, I believe, purposely dragged their feet on building an overnight homeless shelter in the commonwealth’s largest city. A sizable homeless population was often drawn to the Oceanfront or nearby neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2016/01/07/roger-chesley-time-to-build-virginia-beach-homeless-center/" target="_blank">It took plenty of ink</a> and combative rebuttals from local officials before the city finally dedicated the $29 million Housing Resource Center in 2018. The center has beds for individuals and families, and it also provides medical exams, health education and other services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the opening, unhoused people had to travel to a large, nonprofit facility in nearby Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or just sleep where they were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t mean homeless people have no value. It certainly isn’t an excuse to round them up like common criminals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or to remove them from the Downtown Mall in Charlottesville without any alternatives to shelter.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican officials in Virginia and nationwide – recognizing the</span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2015/demo/p25-1143.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ongoing shift in racial demographics across America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – surely would overhaul their messaging, I reasoned, to become more welcoming toward African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP would favor increasing voter registration totals, I thought. It would work diligently to persuade more folks to its side with an inclusive, less-accusatory agenda. Gone would be the days of demonizing people of color on conservative mouthpieces like Fox “News.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, gaining just a tiny segment of non-white voters should ensure repeated electoral victories, especially in presidential contests. Such a strategy would allow the party</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/27/gop-operatives-screed-against-voting-practices-isnt-based-on-facts/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to actually win the popular vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more often this century. There would be no need to manufacture barriers to the ballot box for groups that usually support Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a fool I was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans want to keep power and pretend they’ve earned a mandate, even though in 2022 they garnered a</span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/vote-tracker/2022/house" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">small majority of votes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nationwide in the U.S. House of Representatives. Even though at least</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/states-have-added-nearly-100-restrictive-laws-scotus-gutted-voting-rights" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">29 states have passed 94 restrictive voting laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the U.S. Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Restoring rights a good gubernatorial move, but automatic restoration would be better&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/26/restoring-rights-a-good-gubernatorial-move-but-automatic-restoration-would-be-better/embed/#?secret=sExgjXcgGQ#?secret=ege00cDU1A" data-secret="ege00cDU1A" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest evidence of Republicans erecting hurdles for would-be voters comes from the federal judiciary. In July the “most conservative appellate court” in the country –</span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/the-countrys-most-conservative-court-just-reinstated-a-jim-crow-era-voter-suppression-law/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as Mother Jones put it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – reinstated a Jim Crow-era felon disenfranchisement law in Mississippi.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/26/restoring-rights-a-good-gubernatorial-move-but-automatic-restoration-would-be-better/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s own 1901-02 Constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mimics the racist precepts in Mississippi’s; they’re a perpetual stain on the commonwealth. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/15/foia-friday-a-times-dispatch-lawsuit-and-a-rights-restoration-case-dismissed/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re the only state that permanently strips voting rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from convicted felons unless the governor restores them. Virginia utilized now-defunct poll taxes and literacy tests, too, that targeted Black voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals just upheld a Mississippi law dating to 1890 that permanently prevents residents there from voting if they’ve been convicted of any of about 100 crimes. They include such nonviolent offenses as timber larceny, writing a bad check and bigamy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 13-member majority overturned a three-judge panel of its own court that said the law violated the 8</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amendment’s prohibition on</span><a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-8/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">cruel and unusual punishment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Revealing the ongoing politicization of the federal judiciary, all but one of the majority judges were appointed by Republican presidents. Six judges appointed by Democrats dissented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law was upheld despite the fact it was adopted as part of a state Constitution designed to maintain white supremacy. “We came here to exclude the Negro,” said</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2021/05/01/mississippi-constitution-voting-rights-jim-crow/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Solomon S. Calhoon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the constitutional convention president, more than a century ago. “Nothing short of this will answer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Felons in Mississippi are disproportionately Black. However – as I’ve noted previously –</span><a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/reports/report-to-the-united-nations-on-racial-disparities-in-the-u-s-criminal-justice-system/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Black people and other minorities are treated more harshly than white people are for the same crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Mother Jones article reported that from 1994 to 2017, the law disenfranchised nearly 50,000 people. African Americans comprise 38% of the state’s population – the highest percentage among U.S. states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, it’s curious Mississippi is so vengeful, given Republicans rarely face serious challenges in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last time the Magnolia State picked a Democrat for president was fellow Southerner Jimmy Carter in 1976. For the U.S. Senate, it last picked a Democrat in 1982.</span><a href="https://benniethompson.house.gov/about#:~:text=Serving%20his%2015th%20term%20in,in%20the%20Mississippi%20Congressional%20Delegation." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Bennie Thompson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, serving a district including Jackson, the state capital, is the lone Democrat among four members in the U.S. House of Representatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s probably the … most racialized state in the nation,” David Lublin, professor and chair of the department of government at American University, told me during an interview. Lublin wrote “The Republican South: Democratization and Partisan Change.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-Reconstruction constitutions in the South aren’t badges of honor, he noted: “These were not adopted for nice reasons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s putting it mildly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lublin said because we live in such a highly polarized nation, both Democrats and Republicans fight “tooth and nail” over any advantage – though Democrats might be on the moral side of the voting rights argument.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one likes to give up advantages,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin has restored voting and other civil rights to 7,575 people, his spokesman Christian Martinez said. The state Constitution requires him to make “restoration decisions on an individualized, case-by-case basis,” Martinez told me by email.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-felony-convictions-lawsuit-af720e316859e25b2e99ab8e69ee4af9" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawsuits have been filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the administration because of the opaqueness of the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martinez wouldn’t answer whether Youngkin supports a constitutional amendment that would allow automatic restoration. House Republicans killed such a legislative attempt after</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/03/governors-mismanagement-of-voting-process-continues-as-election-day-looms/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">he took office in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The total number of restorations by Youngkin is dwarfed by those</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/11/democratic-senator-says-hes-meeting-with-youngkin-to-discuss-rights-restoration/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">approved by his predecessors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who made the system more streamlined. Republican Bob McDonnell signed off on more than 10,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Terry McAuliffe approved more than 173,000, and  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Ralph Northam restored </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rights to more than 126,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it political, since so many Black and Latino voters support Democrats? Yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also the right thing to do to re-engage Virginia residents regarding their citizenship duties. Voting gives people a stake in their communities. Given the racist history of felon disenfranchisement in Virginia, legislators should support the amendment process and allow people released from prison to regain their rights automatically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know this is a tough sell for Republican lawmakers, in Virginia and elsewhere, who value power over equity. I’m probably delusional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doesn’t mean I’m wrong.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summertime in Virginia: Temps are sweltering and show no sign of abating. Children are out of school and bored. Various fruits and vegetables are ripe for the picking, even in this hellish heat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And cases of COVID-19,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?state=US" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the scourge of our nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the planet, tick up around the commonwealth. It’s become a rite of the season, as common as antsy kids, forever-running air conditioning and respites at the beach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should get used to the seasonal increase in infections and protect ourselves as best as possible. That means: boosting our vaccines – or getting an initial one</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/06/16/overcoming-vaccine-hesistancy-with-fomo/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">if we’ve stubbornly refused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; practicing good hygiene, including washing our hands frequently; staying home if sick; and testing to detect infections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation now, thankfully, is far from the overwhelming terror at the height of the pandemic that began in early 2020. COVID-19</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?state=US" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">killed more than 1.13 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people in the United States and infected more than 104 million, or less than one-third of the U.S. population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, “There are people severely sick from COVID-19,” Heather Harmon-Sloan, the COVID-19 unit lead for the Virginia Department of Health, told me this week.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“We still see people pass away.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state listed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no coronavirus deaths in the weeks ending June 29 and July 6. That contrasted, though, with 40 deaths reported across Virginia in the week ending Feb. 10, according to the health department.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/covid-19-virginia-pandemic-flirt-variant-vaccination/article_fcb33672-3eef-11ef-902a-b7bb2497ced7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently reported COVID-19 numbers rose in June and that the new FLiRT variant is circulating. The COVID-19 “parent” variant is SARS-CoV-2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 8, the state’s confirmed cases numbered 638, and they had nearly doubled by July 6. Those numbers, though, were dwarfed by the total in December, when 5,600 cases were reported in Virginia. The newest variant has the same symptoms of upper respiratory problems, Harmon-Sloan said. Antiviral treatments should be effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A troubling sign is the total number of people who got the 2023-24 vaccine in Virginia, she said. A new vaccine for 2024-25 will target the FLiRT variant and probably will come out in September. The current one, though, is still available for those who didn’t get vaccinated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 91% of Virginians has gotten</span><a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/covid-vaccine-tracker-states/state/virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">at least one dose of the vaccine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Seventy-seven percent were considered fully vaccinated as of May 2023. About</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/respiratory-diseases-in-virginia/data/vaccines/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.34 million Virginians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> got the latest COVID-19 vaccine, according to state records. (The state population is 8.7 million.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order to update and restore people’s protection and immunity,” Harmon-Sloan told me, “it’s important to get the latest vaccine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news on infections and vaccinations was released about the same time the agency announced that a</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2024-regional-news-releases/southwest-virginia-health-districts-conducting-long-covid-study/" target="_blank"> l<span style="font-weight: 400;">ong COVID surveillance project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which began in October in the Central Virginia Health District, would now be open to all residents in Southwest Virginia. Long COVID means someone is still sick at least two months after getting COVID-19.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants must live in the following state health districts: Roanoke city and Alleghany, Central Virginia, Cumberland Plateau, LENOWISCO, Mount Rogers, New River, Pittsylvania-Danville, Southside or West Piedmont. More details are</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2024-regional-news-releases/southwest-virginia-health-districts-conducting-long-covid-study/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re just hoping to better understand how long COVID has affected people in their daily lives,” said Cali Anderson, senior epidemiologist for the Central Health District. “And identify opportunities to improve long COVID resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Symptoms can include trouble breathing, coughing and feeling weak and tired. The project has so far detected 141 cases of long COVID and fewer than five deaths in the Central Health District, which comprises the Lynchburg city and the counties of Amherst, Appomattox, Bedford and Campbell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Tim Kaine has</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbYVCXAUC1c" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly announced he has the condition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Democrat has co-sponsored legislation to support long COVID sufferers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, the National Institutes of Health announced</span><a href="https://nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-bolster-recover-long-covid-research-efforts-through-infusion-515-million" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it was redirecting $515 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in federal money for the RECOVER initiative. The nationwide research program targets long COVID. The CDC says one in nine adults in the country who have had COVID-19 continue to suffer from long COVID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, it’s comforting to go out to stores, restaurants and places of worship and feel we’re not taking our lives in our hands. Mask-wearing is mostly optional – and doesn’t cause controversy, thankfully. COVID is now considered “endemic,” what the CDC calls “the amount of a particular disease that is usually present in a community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But COVID </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hasn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disappeared.</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">People ages 65 and over and with certain medical conditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> must continue to monitor the latest news and updates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be smart. Get the vaccine. Realize others might refuse – and could be infected. Be cognizant when in poorly ventilated buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re in a much better place today than in 2020 and 2021. Let’s work to keep it that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create a school that’s distinct from the general population of students – and possibly in a separate building altogether. Keep the enrollment to no more than about 30 students at a time. Invite hospitals, colleges and other institutions to share their expertise and resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing: “People often forget they are schools,” said Finch, a professor at Vanderbilt University and a co-founder of the</span><a href="https://recoveryschools.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Association of Recovery Schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit group based in Pennsylvania. Students are “working on high school diplomas, credits, preparing for college, the workforce. … A best practice is they have to provide a solid academic curriculum.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening such specialized schools is a serious, possibly expensive project. However, it’s one that educational officials should undertake if they plan smartly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School divisions and their larger communities are helping to rehabilitate young people at a critical time in their lives – and these academies might make the difference in keeping students clean. Costs shouldn’t be ignored; neither should the fact these schools fight alcohol and drug abuse among teenagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach School Board members are weighing such an initiative, and they’ve already identified some public funding. They are leading an effort that could comprise public school students in Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Suffolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Weems, a longtime Virginia Beach School Board member, is a key proponent. It’s also very personal to her, since Weems lost her</span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/investigations/lawmakers-discussing-recovery-high-school-in-hampton-roads" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">21-year-old daughter Caitlyn to a drug overdose in 2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in high school, Caitlyn Weems had a soccer injury; she broke her nose and lost three teeth. She became addicted to pain medicine and had taken Oxycontin and Percocet at various times, the elder Weems told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s unbelievable how much medicine she was on,” Weems said, noting much of it was prescribed by doctors. “It was so hard to get her help.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly approved $750,000 over two years for a recovery academy in the region. Virginia Beach also has committed $500,000</span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/virginia-to-receive-over-16m-in-juul-agreement/?fbclid=IwY2xjawD7e19leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHaSycTRJO3nwIkUi2uMO0dfR5AzRoJJ1s6FeRN31-zaKN9_MS1zTXcWdvg_aem_qt2gQQDtO9qafWGe2jSQDQ" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from the state settlement with JUUL, the e-cigarette brand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, involving the firm’s marketing and sales practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other details about the proposed academy, though, haven’t been decided. They include how much money each city would contribute; where the academy would be located; and how transportation would be worked out.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/CR/124/13c/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is also considering a recovery high school.</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/05/virginia-prepares-to-launch-its-first-recovery-high-school/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Such schools have been around for decades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though they’ve generally been clustered in about half of the states. The academies often do random drug testing to ensure the students adhere to the rules.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://drugabusestatistics.org/teen-drug-use/#virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports that 9% of all 12- to 17-year-olds in Virginia used alcohol in the past month, and 7% of the age group reported using drugs. One bright spot: Teenagers in the commonwealth were 16.5% less likely to have used drugs in the past month than the average American teen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hampton Roads’ developing plan will study the</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C56ivS1e9uE&amp;t=11s" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield Recovery Academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a possible model. The academy opened in August 2022,  and is a regional effort headed by Chesterfield Public Schools. It’s the first recovery school in the state, and Chesterfield’s is one of about 45 such schools nationwide. The General Assembly contributed</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD671/PDF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly $1.4 million to help start the Chesterfield academy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A recovery school is a good asset for any school division,” Justin Savoy, Chesterfield academy program coordinator, told me. “Unfortunately, the ease of access to drugs and alcohol has increased a lot for students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school takes up to 50 students but often has just 20, said Savoy, whose professional background is in mental health and substance abuse. The staff includes two academic facilitators, three clinicians and a peer recovery specialist, who is someone often maintaining sobriety. A white retriever named Lettie, a therapy dog, is part of the staff and encourages calm. Enrollment requires students to have abstained from drugs and alcohol for at least 20 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past spring, 10 students graduated, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Savoy and two of his students participated in a White House panel on recovery strategies in 2023. “There’s a lot of times when my recovery was impossible,”</span><a href="http://www.youtube.com/live/KZfZiB-WDQ8?si=yojbLf3uIIgXVSJe" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Spain told the audience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I spent the time. I put in the work.” He said he was scheduled to join the military this year, to the cheers of attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Durchslag is director of the</span><a href="https://mtcs.org/pease/about/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">P.E.A.S.E. Academy in Minneapolis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and he’s been at the recovery school since 1995. “Many of the schools operate on a shoestring budget,” he told me, but added, “they are needed resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are they panaceas. Some students, Durchslag said, would be better treated in other settings that offer different services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What they represent is hope, for students and parents alike. That a teen might kick the habit and stay that way. That he’ll have support when he thinks about backsliding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That kind of school “would have been perfect for Caitlyn,” said Weems, the school board member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth the effort to begin the academy, she added. “The things we’re doing now aren’t working.” </span></p>

Anderson, who’s based in Virginia Beach, has filed lawsuits in state and federal courts against the shutterbugs in Chesapeake and Suffolk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is completely, totally profit policing,” the Republican told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson said localities are skirting the regulations the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1442" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly established when it passed legislation in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing the cameras in highway work and school zones. Speed camera tickets are civil fines of up to $100 in Virginia. He offered mainly technical arguments against them.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34245" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34245" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_9998-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Former delegate Tim Anderson speaking at a subcommittee meeting on Jan. 17, 2022. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the state level, Anderson posited, camera vendors are impersonating local governments to collect the fines, so localities are breaking the law to maximize revenues. Also, alleged offenders should receive court dates immediately. If they did, the court system would be overwhelmed, forcing administrators to rethink the overall process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the federal suit, Anderson said, violators should have the right to question third-party vendors that regulate the cameras and oversee videos. Currently, defendants can’t confront their “accusers,” which violates the Sixth Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spokespersons in Chesapeake and Suffolk said their cities don’t comment on pending litigation. That’s a standard response when municipalities have been sued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I support the cameras’ purpose: reducing speeding scofflaws and improving safety. That’s a good thing. I’ve been caught by speed cameras in the metropolitan Washington area, and I knew I was driving above the posted limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, motorists have to drive at least 10 miles above the speed limit to be photographed, so there’s wiggle room already. Violations occur because people don’t respect traffic laws. (You can add busting through red lights and not obeying stop signs, too. But I digress.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of cities outside Virginia, by the way, operate speed cameras in places other than school or work zones. That includes busy thoroughfares and wide boulevards. The commonwealth hasn’t gone that far,</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb20" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">though a bill to expand speed camera usage failed this year in the Assembly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson concedes he’s not aware of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other attorney in Virginia who’s jumped into the fray to challenge the cameras. That’s telling, because it suggests this could be a quixotic campaign. Nor is he suggesting his own clients obeyed speed limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a dozen localities in Virginia use the devices now,</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD163/PDF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a Virginia State Police report released in February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It feels like to me that government is picking on people,” Anderson noted, adding he’s handling the cases pro bono. Anderson emailed me the complaints in the state lawsuit against the city of Suffolk and the federal lawsuit against the city of Chesapeake. One plaintiff is named in each case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, localities are raking in plenty of cash, and that infuriates the Virginia Beach attorney. Critics call the violations a backdoor tax – though I don’t understand why it’s OK for a police officer to pull over a speeding motorist, but advanced technology that catches speeders should be verboten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The District of Columbia, by the way, can impose</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/11/24/dc-traffic-cameras-expansion/#TRFBUSSLCZGQ3D4XPDZ3TOYV7I-3" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fines of up to $500 for speed camera violations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s much more expensive than here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake started speed camera monitoring in April 2022 and has since issued 160,000 citations, city spokesman Heath Covey told me by email. The city has raised roughly $9.8 million in revenues. Fewer violations are being issued now than since the program began, he said – suggesting more people are obeying the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For 2023, Suffolk collected nearly $8.7 million in school and work zone violations. Fairfax County, the state’s largest locality in population, reaped $800,000 in violations last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Jones is a Norfolk Democrat and former delegate who sponsored the 2020 legislation. He’s somewhat surprised by Anderson’s campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the first time I’ve heard any complaints” about speed-camera operations, Jones said, noting he still gets emails to his political account about various issues. The 2020 bill limited the cameras to school and work zones, he said, “where you want people to slow down anyway.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, many police departments have struggled to reach full strength since the pandemic and the police killing of George Floyd. The cameras help bolster law enforcement, Jones said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is Anderson interpreting the law correctly, and does he have a legitimate case? Darryl Brown, a University of Virginia School of Law professor, said it’s possible, especially on the state claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The plaintiff could well be correct about the violations they allege,” Brown said. “Although even if the city loses in this lawsuit, it ought to be able to revise the way it handles speeding violations and, with some new practices, continue to enforce the speeding law on the basis of speed camera videos.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said the federal lawsuit is a stretch because the Sixth Amendment applies to criminal offenses, not civil ones. Speed camera violations are the latter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why haven’t other attorneys complained about the issue? The law stipulating rules for speed cameras didn’t start yesterday. Anderson’s crusade is a lonely one, and rightly so. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/16/traffic-cameras-dc-speeding/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently reported streets in D.C. with speed cameras saw speeding drop sharply, citing city data. Easing up on the accelerator should be applauded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it might be cumbersome logistically, I hope the county approves the program. More communities should try doing something different, instead of being perennially exasperated at the sight of people begging motorists and pedestrians for money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A special city task force recently presented</span><a href="https://legistarweb-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/pdf/2658888/Item_4-B.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a possible project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Prince William’s Board of County Supervisors.</span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/county-supervisors-mull-hiring-pandhandlers-to-pick-up-roadside-litter/article_f0ef1d7e-2879-11ef-9e57-73629aa3e75f.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The program would pay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> panhandlers $13 an hour to pick up roadside litter while working two, three-hour shifts a week.</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve written previously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about similar projects nationwide.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u2ddK1Gb7n"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/">Helping panhandlers involves more than just easing bans on begging</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A supervisor had asked county staff to report on panhandling at intersections and businesses. Nikki Brown, a county spokeswoman, told me by email Tuesday she didn’t have statistics on how often panhandling occurs there, “but we have received several complaints and anecdotal information from our residents” and county supervisors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of specifics makes me wonder how bad the problem actually is in the county of nearly a half-million people. But I digress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimates for such a project aren’t complete, nor is it clear who would pay for it. The nonprofit Keep Prince William Beautiful would administer it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County has run a similar program since 2019 called</span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/publicworks/oss" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Operation Stream Shield”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that employs homeless individuals to remove litter and non-native invasive plant species in waterways. However, during a brief search, I didn’t find other localities running such projects in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of laudable goals in Prince William County’s proposal stand out:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, the county would direct panhandlers, who are often homeless, to services they need and provide work opportunities. Second, people inclined to give a few dollars to those begging would be urged instead to donate to homeless community partners, who are better equipped to help long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board supervisors will debate the plan in July. They should approve it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only will panhandlers pick up trash for cash; the program could also help them prop up their lives.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Racially regressive policies and actions move Virginia in the wrong direction&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/24/racially-regressive-policies-and-actions-move-virginia-in-the-wrong-direction/embed/#?secret=68hjJY6EkN#?secret=jV6lwPwkR5" data-secret="jV6lwPwkR5" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An African-American woman’s quest to buy a pricey condo near the Virginia Beach Oceanfront – impeded by the white homeowner’s refusal because of her race – is just the latest example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bias Raven Baxter faced, detailed in a recent article in</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/31/realestate/race-home-buying-raven-baxter.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was only unusual in this way:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jane Walker, 84, candidly told her agent why she didn’t want Baxter, a molecular biologist and</span><a href="https://x.com/ravenscimaven/status/1791680744055595443" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">social media maven</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a quarter-million online followers, to buy the condo. Housing rights officials say discriminatory homeowners and landlords frequently use subtle methods or mask the real reasons why they don’t want people to move in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Virginia Beach transaction, however, the unspoken part was said out loud: Walker didn’t want to sell to a Black person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident got tons of publicity because Baxter </span><a href="https://x.com/ravenscimaven/status/1796521068024447244" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote about it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on X (formerly Twitter), where she has more than 165,000 followers. She also has her own website,</span><a href="https://thesciencemaven.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Raven the Science Maven</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that because we’ve come so far in history, we think that things can’t happen anymore,” Baxter, 30, told me this week. “And we forget racism isn’t something that we just leave in the past. It’s something that can pop up at any time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed. Progress isn’t always linear. We often move forward in fits and starts. Or even fall backward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, unless you’re the person directly affected by such bias, it’s very easy to dismiss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter seems somewhat taken aback by all that’s happened since she went public with her housing story. “I’ve kind of been overwhelmed [by] how deep of an issue this is,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She declined to answer some of my questions, including whether she’ll still buy the condo. However, an official with 757 Realty, the company assisting her, told me the closing is scheduled in August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter also has filed discrimination claims with the Virginia Fair Housing Office and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, The Times reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter was born and raised in Buffalo. She works remotely for a New York City hospital and lives in Northern Virginia with her partner, Ronald Gamble Jr., 35, a theoretical astrophysicist. Baxter wanted to own property outright, and Gamble encouraged her to find a house near the beach, a longtime dream of hers, The Times said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She viewed the Virginia Beach condo online and liked what she saw. It has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, and a marble fireplace. It’s a stone’s throw from a country club golf course, and it’s a quick walk to the beach and Atlantic Ocean.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter contacted a listing agent, did a virtual tour and agreed to the $749,000 asking price. She made a down payment. She and Gamble saw the condo in person May 17. That’s the same day when the owner’s agent, Susan Pender of Berkshire Hathaway RW Towne Realty, introduced them to Walker, the seller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">757 Realty provided me a chronology of events. That narrative said shortly after Baxter and Gamble left the condo May 17, Walker told her agent – Pender – that she didn’t want to sell to Baxter because of her race. Pender relayed that information to the folks at 757 Realty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One disagreement between buyer and seller was a decades-old air-conditioning system that needed to be upgraded. It’s unclear if that affected the seller’s attitude and demeanor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither Pender nor her boss returned my messages. No one answered when I rang the doorbell at that condo this week, which is on the</span><a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/virginia-beach-departments-docs/planning/Boards-Commissions/Historic-Preservation-Commission/Historical-Register-List_2021.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach Historical Register</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s telling, however, that none of the principals denied the biased statement occurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discrimination in housing in the United States is illegal for home sellers and their real estate agents under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Yet racial bias remains an issue, along with discrimination based on skin color, national origin, religion, disability and other protected classes covered by federal law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve had other complaints of direct use of racial slurs,” Brenda Castañeda, deputy director for advocacy for </span><a href="https://homeofva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOME of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, told me. “I haven’t seen one this blatant or open.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her nonprofit organization assists residents who believe they have faced housing discrimination. It also sends in testers of different races to check if people are being given the same information, or whether some folks are steered elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baxter’s story is similar to the claims </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/realestate/wendell-pierce-harlem-apartment-racism.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of actor Wendell Pierce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who says his rental application for a Harlem apartment was rejected by a white landlord. “Racism and bigots are real,” </span><a href="https://x.com/WendellPierce/status/1797805253787611141" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said on X this week.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “There are those who will do anything to destroy life’s journey for Black folks.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Fair Housing Alliance said in its most recent report covering specific trends that</span><a href="https://nationalfairhousing.org/resource/2023-fair-housing-trends-report/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 33,000 fair housing complaints were recorded in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the most in a single year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tally might only be a fraction of the actual total, the Washington-based coalition said, because “most incidents of housing discrimination go undetected or unreported.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization continued: “Housing providers may lie about the availability of housing units or the monthly rent for apartments, steering Blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans to rent or buy homes only in neighborhoods of color.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another problem is the disparate treatment appraisers dole out as property owners place their homes on the market. I’ve written before about how African-American home sellers are often given lower appraisals, only to</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/23/blacks-others-shouldnt-have-to-obliterate-their-presence-to-receive-fair-home-value/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">receive more expensive ones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they obliterate any hint a Black family lives there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Robertson IV, spokesman for the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation, told me the state’s Fair Housing Office has received 318 complaints this fiscal year, which ends June 30. Nearly 25% were race-based.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most penalties for breaking the law, though, are civil ones, Castañeda said. Rarely does anyone face jail time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That should change. Without the threat of going behind bars, there’s little to compel racist property owners to do the right thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole situation has been a whirlwind for Baxter, who thought buying the condo would be routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only color that should matter in a real estate transaction is green,” she told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in 2024, that’s not always the case. </span></p>

University bigwigs pat themselves on the back for the PR boost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noticeable numbers of graduates then protest at the ceremony, outraged at the luminary – and the university’s tone-deaf selection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what we witnessed last week as</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/05/11/vcu-youngkin-commencement-walkout/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin gave the commencement speech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also what happened at Howard University more than four decades ago.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1981/05/10/bush-speaks-at-howard/5723c487-587c-408a-a553-2e920ac590e6/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – representing an administration that repeatedly attacked the quest for racial equality – spoke at the historically Black institution in Washington. I was among the 1,000 graduates receiving degrees that sunny day in 1981.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My alma mater’s decision to provide Ronald Reagan’s second-in-command a platform was more egregious than VCU’s – by far. For example, months earlier then-candidate Reagan had campaigned</span><a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/reagan-speech-at-neshoba/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">near where three civil rights workers had been murdered by Ku Klux Klan members in 1964</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Mississippi. In his 1980 speech, Reagan invoked “states’ rights” – code words for keeping the feds from investigating blatant discrimination, especially throughout the South. Nor did he even acknowledge the previous murders, which had to be investigated by the FBI to achieve justice. </span></p>

His administration’s decision to review</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/28/youngkin-administration-reviews-race-dei-syllabi-for-vcu-george-mason-courses/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">syllabi for courses about diversity, equity, inclusion and race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at VCU and George Mason University – what one faculty member called “hostile state scrutiny” – ultimately led to both universities</span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/diversity/2024/05/13/vcu-gmu-wont-require-dei-classes-after-youngkins-review" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announcing course mandates wouldn’t go into effect this fall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the person you let riff on</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/05/11/vcu-youngkin-commencement-walkout/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">musical metaphors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at commencement? I’m wondering if the folks who invited Youngkin would’ve allowed the fox to guard the henhouse, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A VCU spokesman told me that it’s par for the course to invite the state’s chief executive to address the graduating class. Brian McNeill said previous gubernatorial speakers from both parties include George Allen, Jim Gilmore, Mark Warner, Tim Kaine, Bob McDonnell and Terry McAuliffe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We invite varied leaders from different backgrounds and with different perspectives to share their stories with our graduating class,” he said by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That may be. Though I don’t recall any recent governors as so overtly suspicious – and contemptuous of – the education community as Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNeill said a</span><a href="https://president.vcu.edu/media/president-2021/media/docs/ootp2021-documents/HonoraryDegreesandOtherSpecialAwardsPolicy03-22-2019.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">special committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annually recommends possible commencement speakers. That panel may include: cabinet members; board, faculty and student representatives; and other people chosen by the president. He didn’t have a list of the group’s members this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know because it seems students, as on most campuses when such controversies arise, would’ve been the ones most likely to object. Were they outvoted?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 1,200 graduating students signed up for the main commencement Saturday at the Greater Richmond Convention Center. Dozens walked out during Youngkin’s speech for a variety of reasons, including his crusade against efforts to promote racial equity in education and the teaching of Black history. Another reason students said they walked out was to support Palestinians during the ongoing</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/29/youngkin-says-no-encampments-on-virginia-campuses-supports-peaceful-protests/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Israeli military offensive in Gaza</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked a Youngkin spokesman about the guv’s reaction, Christian Martinez replied the day was about “celebrating the students.” That’s what you say when you deflect from the crux of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I noted earlier, the incident was a déjà vu moment. My mother had pleaded with me the morning of my graduation in 1981 not to protest. I was lukewarm about making any obvious display of disgust toward Bush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet I supported others who turned their backs on the vice president, as dozens did that day. Bush, as a chief representative of the Reagan administration, had to answer for its regressive attitudes on race. If there were no public protest, it would’ve been a tacit approval of the administration’s social actions – some coded, some overt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though only in office a few months, some of the administration’s positions and viewpoints were clear:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2004/06/10/1953700/reagan-the-south-and-civil-rights" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration opposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affirmative action and busing for school integration. It threatened to veto an extension of the</span><a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/civil-rights-act/immediate-impact.html#:~:text=The%20Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965%20provided%20direct%20federal%20enforcement,register%20voters%20and%20observe%20elections." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act of 1965</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which had allowed many Blacks – especially in the South – to finally gain access to the ballot box. (</span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/du-bois-review-social-science-research-on-race/article/reagan-legacy-and-the-racial-divide-in-the-george-w-bush-era/8B1FDB60B5252AE4B81733E78C701731" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reagan had opposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act during his time in California, where he’d been governor. The landmark laws spurred equality for Black people in America.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, Reagan had been fond of relaying a story on the campaign trail about a notorious</span><a href="https://www.salon.com/2014/01/11/the_racism_at_the_heart_of_the_reagan_presidency/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chicago welfare queen.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The undertones suggested Black people were getting unfair advantages at the expense of white people, even though the woman in question wasn’t typical of the average welfare recipient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why, then, was Bush invited to my campus? Howard is a</span><a href="https://thedig.howard.edu/all-stories/howard-works-meet-operating-expenses-face-unprecedented-inflation#:~:text=As%20a%20federally%20chartered%20HBCU,of%20Howard%20University's%20operating%20budget." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">federally chartered historically Black university</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it gets a sizable federal appropriation each year. HU officials were likely currying favor with the new presidential administration – despite the blowback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least, that’s what I remember from the time when I was more excited to earn my bachelor’s degree in print journalism than show disgust at Bush.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those memories came flooding back after I read about the VCU protest. I doubt most graduates will see the incident Saturday as anything more than a blip on an otherwise joyous day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be mortified, though, is Youngkin. His actions caused the protest in the first place. If he hadn’t politicized education, no one would even remember his speech – or the walkout.</span></p>

Or</span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/1998/01/18/an-innocent-bystander/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Roberson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whom I once interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these individuals were “third parties” – innocent pedestrians, drivers or their passengers who got in the way of speeding criminal suspects or pursuing law enforcement officials around the state. They died or were horribly injured during high-speed police pursuits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m mentioning them following a</span><a href="https://stateline.org/2024/04/12/in-reversal-more-areas-allow-high-speed-police-chases/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that several states and municipalities around the country have reversed policies about high-speed chases. They’re allowing police more latitude to speed to catch suspects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a dangerous trend that should end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In previous years, many departments had limited high-speed pursuits. But</span><a href="https://stateline.org/2024/04/12/in-reversal-more-areas-allow-high-speed-police-chases/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Stateline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes legislators and some police agencies, citing concerns about crime, have since eased restrictions. (Stateline is a sister publication of the Virginia Mercury.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is happening despite data that reveal major </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">decreases </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in violent and property crime rates since the early 1990s, according to the</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/24/what-the-data-says-about-crime-in-the-us/#:~:text=Property%20crime%20in%20the%20U.S.,violent%20crimes%20per%20100%2C000%20people." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s as if tough-on-crime politicians aren’t paying attention to the data. They’re letting perceptions of crime outweigh the actual facts, while glossing over the inherent dangers of such police chases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida, Washington state, the District of Columbia and San Francisco are among the places that have rolled back restrictions over the past year. That decision is alarming, especially given the possibility for deaths and injuries to unsuspecting civilians and the officers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several law enforcement agencies I canvassed around Virginia still have strict guidelines and parameters regarding police chases. They weigh the seriousness of the crimes a suspect is accused of versus the possible threat to others on the roadways.</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-courts/virginia-police-high-speed-chases/article_f689973e-3c69-11ee-9bdf-334d53ee7361.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found similar results last year when reporting on a handful of agencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fairfax County Police Department, the largest among localities in the state with nearly 1,500 sworn officers,</span><a href="https://d.docs.live.net/d016fe375902de20/Documents/GO-504.pdf%20(fairfaxcounty.gov)" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has a pursuit policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mandating officers have a reasonable suspicion that fleeing motorists or their passengers have committed or tried to commit a violent felony, or possibly violated any felony or misdemeanor involving the display, threat or firing of a gun or explosive device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county’s latest policy began in 2021 and was updated in March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised pursuit policy aligned FCPD with best practices regionally and across the country,” a police department spokesman told me by email. “This policy balances the need to pursue criminals while maintaining safety for all within our community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Chesapeake, among the circumstances that police officers must consider are the “severity of crime for which the offending driver is a suspect” and that person’s “vehicle speeds and driving behavior,” according to the department’s 11-page pursuit policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The decision to continue the pursuit should be based on the officer’s reasonable belief that the necessity for immediate apprehension outweighs the level of danger created by the pursuit,” it emphasizes. Pursuits are to be ended immediately in a number of situations, including when a suspect “begins to drive in the opposite lane against oncoming traffic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of those steps seem smart. Yet, according to one</span><a href="https://courtroomproven.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">study by a Las Vegas law firm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia ranks second among the states where a deadly crash following a police pursuit is most likely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The January news release by H&amp;P Law said it analyzed the percentage of fatal crashes involving a police pursuit in each state. The firm, known for personal injury litigation, studied crashes from 2017 to 2021 reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s percentage of fatal crashes involving a police pursuit was 2.03%, only behind Georgia at 2.09%. Some 82 deadly motor accidents occurred during police chases over the five years that were studied, the law firm said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia State Police spokeswoman, at my request, provided statistics on police pursuits from 2020 through 2023. The department patrols interstates, highways and rural roads in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatively few people were injured or killed in those 2,222 police chases. Most of those harmed were criminal suspects or law enforcement officials. Last year, though, 28 third-party individuals were injured during 716 State Police chases. In 2021, one uninvolved person and nine suspects died during 492 pursuits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to pursuits, police officers and their supervisors should prioritize “safety above all else,” Tim Goler, assistant professor of sociology and urban affairs at Norfolk State University, told me.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“A balanced approach is crucial.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such pursuits should occur only when violent felons are the targets, for example, instead of someone suspected of something as minor as an expired license plate, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goler also advocated for serious evaluations of such incidents afterward, something he questioned is happening now in most police chases. “Departments should have rigorous review policies in place for every pursuit,” he continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police agencies don’t want to let suspects in murders, rapes or robberies run free, obviously. But they have to ask themselves questions, too: Can they arrest a suspect later? Do they know where the person is headed, such as home or a workplace? Is that person an immediate threat to others in the community?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatives of those killed during police pursuits, especially people who weren’t the target, are left asking: “Why my loved one? Was the chase even necessary?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last July 29,</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime/hopewell-police-chase-ends-in-fatal-collision/article_930cca2c-2fa4-11ee-a81e-ab264077972e.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a high-speed chase in Hopewell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ended when the driver of a pickup truck sought by Prince George County Police ran a red light. The truck struck a car, and the car’s driver, 45-year-old Andre Bassett Jr. of Jacksonville, Fla., was fatally injured. Police said they had tried to stop the pickup truck because its driver was traveling 67 mph in a 45 mph zone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Aug. 7,</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime/1-dead-in-carjacking-and-police-chase-in-henrico/article_14088abc-361c-11ee-a6e0-47803b6f3a23.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a high-speed chase occurred in Henrico County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as county police pursued a carjacking suspect. The suspect’s car crashed into a boy riding his bike, killing Geormond “Geo” Morton, 17, of Henrico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are such incidents new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a quarter century ago, while reporting at the (Newport News) Daily Press, I met Gary Roberson. While walking to a convenience store in 1997 in Newport News, he was struck by a car fleeing police when it ran up onto the sidewalk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roberson suffered a broken lower back, damaged nerves in his spine, a broken leg, fractured collarbone and paralysis below the waist for a few months – among other injuries. He eventually endured more than half-dozen operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suspect who struck Roberson, police said at the time, had earlier arrests or convictions for speeding, cocaine possession, brandishing a firearm and assault. A lawsuit filed by Roberson claimed police officers should have prevented the suspect from even entering his car the day of the chase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police officers can’t have a blanket “no chase ever” policy. Violent suspects would speed away every time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, we know fleeing suspects on our roads won’t be responsible. That’s why police officers must be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officers have an extra duty not just to make an arrest, but also to prevent harm against innocents. It’s an unfortunate – though necessary – burden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erring on the side of restraint may allow nonviolent offenders and low-level criminals freedom – at least immediately. Yet it will also keep third parties alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a goal police officers should accept. Municipalities and departments bucking that philosophy are placing their desire for arrests over public safety.</span></p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank Hruska, executive director of Habitat for Humanity for South Hampton Roads, faces persistent problems trying to build modest homes for low- and middle-income families. Inflation has boosted the cost of housing construction. Plus, vacant, usable land has become more expensive over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in a perfect storm right now,” Hruska told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I interviewed him after his Habitat chapter announced it was postponing</span><a href="https://www.shrhabitat.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the application process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because it hadn’t been able to acquire land for the 2025-26 building season. Applications had been scheduled to open May 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said vacant lots in his region were selling for $30,000 to $35,000 in 2018. Yet they averaged $75,000 last year, Hruska said, even though the lots were about the same size and sat in school divisions with the same reputation for quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hruska’s challenge isn’t unique. Other Habitat</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/03/18/peninsulas-habitat-for-humanity-cant-take-applications-for-first-time-in-39-years/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">affiliates in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have also postponed the application process, some for the first time in decades. Studies and statements by the</span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/summary/Rpt559Sum-1.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly’s watchdog agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/blog/affordable-housing-crisis-grows-while-efforts-increase-supply-fall-short" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the federal government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others speak of the longstanding problem to secure affordable housing, especially by Americans who aren’t rich.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Land prices increased 60% from 2012-2019, and the cost of homes more than doubled from 1998 to 2021,” reported the U.S. Government Accountability Office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last week,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/04/10/dc-regional-housing-targets/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the D.C. metropolitan area has fallen way behind in meeting a 2019 goal of building 320,000 units over the next decade to handle that region’s growth. “Fairfax County, the most populous jurisdiction in the region,” The Post said, “is on pace to build only 36 percent of its target.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One obvious factor: Elected leaders there set the goal before the devastating COVID-19 pandemic occurred and shredded the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation, lack of developable land and the desire by builders to erect expensive houses to recoup their investments are factors in the dearth of affordable housing, both in Virginia and nationwide. Incentives for developers to build multifamily units aren’t always enough to propel construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if they decided to be benevolent, to take a modest fee for themselves … their costs to build homes are really high,” said Erica Sims, president of Richmond-based</span><a href="https://www.hdadvisors.net/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HDAdvisors, a consulting firm specializing in affordable housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders also want to tap into water and sewer lines to help keep costs low, Sims told me. If developers have to install roads and sewer themselves, they might decline those projects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Joint Legislative and Audit Review Commission – the aforementioned Assembly watchdog agency – notes what many housing and poverty advocates say: Families are “cost burdened” when they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing expenses. Such a predicament means it’s difficult for households to pay for other necessities, and it increases the likelihood of eviction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Approximately 29 percent of Virginia households (905,000) were housing cost burdened in 2019, and nearly half of these households spent more than 50 percent of their income on housing,” JLARC said in a 2021 report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means many families are just one job layoff, medical emergency or major car repair away from losing a roof over their heads. It’s a stressful way to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Renting a home can help families avoid the upfront costs of homebuying, JLARC noted, but the commonwealth “has a shortage of at least 200,000 affordable rental units for extremely and very low-income households.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the possible solutions to this lack of affordable housing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It requires a heavy investment at the state and federal levels,” Sims said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cities have land, and they should set some aside for affordable housing,” said Hruska. Localities that bar homes on smaller lots, he added, could alter zoning regulations to permit them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(In August, </span><a href="https://dhcd.virginia.gov/governor-youngkin-announces-over-52-million-affordable-and-special-needs-housing-loans" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced $52 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in affordable and special needs housing loans for dozens of projects.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home ownership is important. It tends to make individuals more concerned about their neighborhoods because they have a stake in their success. A home is usually the largest monetary investment a family owns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want working-class families to have the American Dream, and that way we have better neighborhoods and better citizens,” said Hruska, the local Habitat official.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look no further than Andrew and Linda Layne, who moved into their Chesapeake Habitat home in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Layne, 59, didn’t know I was going to drop in last week to his one-story home with three bedrooms, 1½ bathrooms and roughly 1,100 square feet. Yet he was wearing a red T-shirt from the housing nonprofit when I stopped by.</span></p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s quite an endorsement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s the first house I’ve ever owned,” he told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The house rose on a former vacant lot.  A green front lawn now greets visitors. Solar panels adorn the roof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and his wife earlier lived in a Virginia Beach townhouse. Layne sought out Habitat after suffering a serious accident while working as a longshoreman in 2012. “I almost died,” he said, adding that he received disability payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Laynes contributed hundreds of hours of “sweat equity” to the organization, including at the site of their home. The city’s redevelopment and housing authority helped fund the construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes me a very proud person,” he said, while showing me room-by-room through the home and their cozy backyard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The family’s pit bull and chocolate husky barked at and sniffed me before deciding I was harmless. They then returned to their usual perches in the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Habitat is awesome,” said 54-year-old Linda Layne, who recently started a cleaning job at the year-old Rivers Casino in Portsmouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nonprofit’s good works, though, can only go so far to reduce the affordable housing shortage. Roughly 3,700 families have bought homes through Habitat affiliates since the late 1970s, a state Habitat official told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many more Virginians, though, want to experience the same level of belonging expressed by the Laynes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one of pride in having a home of your own. </span></p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marvin L. Lake – journalist, Renaissance man, holder of many professional “firsts” – was made of decidedly sterner stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, he couldn’t have withstood the racial slights and outright prejudice he fought after becoming The Virginian-Pilot’s first Black summer intern in 1966 and later,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/04/02/marvin-lake-the-virginian-pilots-first-black-reporter-dies-at-80/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in 1969, its first Black reporter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He understood the long game, though: Rise through the newspaper ranks. Become a mentor to legions of young journalists – especially African Americans and others of color. Be a conduit between the paper and Hampton Roads’ Black community, which distrusted The Pilot</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2007/12/16/after-41-years-diversity-fairness-efforts-stand-out/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for its biased depictions of Black people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were tasks the Norfolk native relished in a career that eventually spanned 41 years at the newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and I worked together on The Pilot editorial page from my arrival in 2000 until his retirement in 2007. I edited his public editor columns during that period – with him often saying “I’m writing it in my head” as he busted deadlines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake, 80, died last week at his Norfolk home after a long illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His professional “offspring,” some from as far away as California and Florida, returned to Norfolk on Tuesday. His funeral took place at a church across from Norfolk State University, where Lake had earned a bachelor of arts degree in sociology in 1967.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roughly 200 mourners this week included a top magazine editor, a college educator and other media professionals. U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, a Norfolk Democrat, was among the politicians who attended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derek Dingle first met Lake in November 1979 when he became a copy aide, or assistant, at The Pilot, he said at Shiloh Baptist Church. “Marvin became my mentor at that moment,” Dingle said, and Lake encouraged him to report and write – though he sometimes endured Lake’s exacting, tough editing via a red pen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was close to tears!” Dingle said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lesson Dingle learned well.</span><a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/management/derekdingle/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s been the top editor for years at Black Enterprise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and has held other senior positions there.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jou.ufl.edu/staff/herbert-lowe/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herbert Lowe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, onetime Pilot reporter and now a senior journalism lecturer at the University of Florida, told me Lake helped edit a piece he’d written long after Lowe had left Norfolk. It was an exceptional display of help to a former colleague.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kia Morgan Smith, who I interviewed by phone in Atlanta, called Lake a father figure. “It was his style, his presence. He really cared about young Black kids,” said Smith, who later worked at Black Enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lake’s mentees relayed stories of tough love, consistent support and even financial help. They noted his patience and the fact he rarely raised his voice in anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not surprisingly, Lake earned his share of professional accolades. Among them: In 1997, he developed and edited a newspaper series, “Church Street: What Was Lost,” and narrated and hosted an award-winning television documentary, “Church Street: Harlem of the South,” about the onetime Black hub in Norfolk.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He was inducted into the</span><a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/inductees_announced_for_virginia_communications_hall_of_fame" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Communications Hall of Fame in 2007</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also ended several prejudicial habits in the paper. As he wrote </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2007/12/16/after-41-years-diversity-fairness-efforts-stand-out/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in his farewell column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a white reporter often peppered stories with comments from a “source close to the black community.” The source, Lake learned, “was a white man frequently critical of Blacks.” Treachery at its worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no exaggeration to say Marvin overhauled the coverage of The Pilot and altered the trajectory of the careers of many journalists. That’s a fitting epitaph. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2022/RD636/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says Virginia — compared to other states — does a strong job fighting homelessness. For the 2021-22 fiscal year, for example, “the rate of homelessness per 10,000 on average in Virginia is 7, and remains the fourth-lowest including all 50 states and territories,” according to the report compiled by the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can do even better, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pockets of homelessness are</span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/virginia-beach/new-waterfront-homeless-camp-sets-up-on-london-bridge-creek/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">noticeable statewide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/29/homelessness-northern-virginia-fairfax/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">makeshift tent communities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/helping-panhandlers-involves-more-than-just-easing-bans-on-begging/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">panhandlers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to people queuing up</span><a href="https://rescuemission.net/meals/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for free meals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doled out by</span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/news/ways-you-can-help-fight-hunger-and-homelessness-fairfax-county" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ministries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Efforts by the latter are laudable, but they don’t help people thrive or radically alter their living conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Roanoke, Dawn Sandoval is the executive director of The Least of These Ministries. The nonprofit has transformed a former motel into Suites by TLOT, making it more than just a temporary shelter for the homeless. Officials opened 12 renovated units on Feb. 15, and they’re completing work on the remaining six units.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We currently serve the unsheltered population and have discovered that many of those experiencing homelessness are on a fixed income,” Sandoval told me by email. Soaring inflation makes rental homes unaffordable for them, Sandoval said, and many are also “wading through lengthy wait lists for Section 8 and HUD-VASH vouchers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acronym stands for the U.S. Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theleastoftheseministry.org/suites-by-tlot.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ministry’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes that people pay an affordable rental rate at the renovated motel. Each room has a full-size bed, private bathroom, refrigerator and other amenities. TLOT also plans to shuttle residents to downtown Roanoke several days a week to help them get to work and take advantage of other essential services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a much larger and comprehensive scale,</span><a href="https://www.virginiasupportivehousing.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Supportive Housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connects the formerly homeless with secure housing. The nonprofit organization, founded in 1988, opened its first housing complex in 1992. VSH now operates 11 housing communities in Richmond, Charlottesville, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Portsmouth and Chesapeake totaling 711 apartments, the agency said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38188" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38188" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_3834-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Heron&#8217;s Landing, with 60 apartments in Chesapeake, is one of several complexes statewide for the formerly homeless operated by Virginia Supportive Housing. (Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group seeks to end homelessness by providing permanent housing and supportive services, including counseling, case management and connecting folks to primary healthcare. People struggling with substance abuse or mental health problems, thus, aren’t just told to figure things out on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It uses a model called “Housing First,” which prioritizes housing individuals as soon as possible, and then provides services to help maintain stability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allison Bogdanovic, VSH’s executive director, told me that in 2023, the organization assisted nearly 1,700 people living in its apartments as well as those who used the organization’s service programs. It had revenues of $16.4 million last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She proudly noted, by email, that 94% of its residents remain in stable, permanent housing. That means people are protected from the threats of violence, extreme weather conditions and more, all of which they might have experienced had they been on the streets. The average length of stay in VSH housing is six years, Bogdanovic added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We remain committed to ending homelessness in our existing footprint and are evaluating the feasibility of expanding into smaller communities,” she told me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about VSH when it opened the 60-unit</span><a href="https://www.virginiasupportivehousing.org/regions/hampton-roads/gosnold-apartments/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gosnold Apartments in 2006 in Norfolk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the group’s first foray into Hampton Roads. The $6 million development is in a former RC Cola bottling warehouse. Within the next year, the nonprofit plans a major renovation-expansion there to 100 units.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38189" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:150px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Joel_Chambers-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-38189" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Joel_Chambers-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Joel Chambers was formerly homeless and now lives at Gosnold Apartments in Norfolk. The complex is one of 11 operated in the state by Virginia Supportive Housing. The complexes have more than 700 apartments. (Courtesy Joel Chambers)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joel Chambers has called Gosnold home since 2019. The 39-year-old Baltimore native, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, had spent several months on the streets of the Virginia Beach Oceanfront after bouncing around jobs and serving a brief stint in jail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was he worried for his safety while homeless? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a bond in that community,” Chambers told me. “You look out for me, we’ll look out for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting connected to a home at the housing complex, though, has been a godsend. Housing advocates directed him to the vacancy. A federal voucher helps pay the rent.“Gosnold makes you feel as though it’s not all over,” Chambers said. “I have a bit of a sense of legitimacy, humanity, even.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He works from home for AbbVie pharmaceuticals as an ambassador resource specialist. “I love on people,” Chambers explained. He contacts patients who use the company’s medications, makes sure they have enough supplies and prescriptions and generally provides a kind ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living at Gosnold means he doesn’t have to worry about where he’ll find long-term shelter. “I can use time and energy on myself,” he said, including getting to physical therapy. “It’s a calming effect.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts like the renovated motel in Roanoke and Virginia Supportive Housing’s projects help fight homelessness. They transform lives and keep people safe. They’re worthy of publicity and support.</span></p>

This, however, is precisely how the present system works. It must be changed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m proud to have been on the editorial board that wrote the opinion piece in 2001.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less so the fact the high cost for families is still an issue in the commonwealth. Many relatives of those behind bars are poor. Exorbitant phone fees place an extra, unnecessary burden on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inmate advocacy and re-entry groups, as well as equity-minded state legislators, have worked to change the past parasitic formula. The current rate is a little more than 4 cents a minute; the department reduced it to that amount in 2015, the</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-headed-to-governor-aims-to-cut-prison-phone-costs/article_80c19932-d739-11ee-90b9-1f51c7b402f2.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before then, the rate had been 33 cents a minute for prepaid calls, and the department had collected commissions between 35% and 41%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, sponsored a bill this General Assembly session requiring state prisons to use pay phone and debit-card calling services at the lowest possible rate.</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb801" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HB801</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed both chambers easily after Rasoul’s bid to offer free calls in corrections facilities was amended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Staying in touch with family motivates incarcerated people to engage in prosocial behavior and rehabilitation while serving their sentence and is critical to their successful re-entry into society upon release,”</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2022/RD500/PDF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">noted a 2022 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a work group studying phone fees, among others, in Virginia correctional facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased contact with relatives benefits prisoners, their families and the public, the report added.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u0qwu3cXov"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/13/va-house-panel-rejects-bills-to-boost-prison-oversight-give-inmates-free-phone-calls/">Va.

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. House panel rejects bills to boost prison oversight, give inmates free phone calls&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/13/va-house-panel-rejects-bills-to-boost-prison-oversight-give-inmates-free-phone-calls/embed/#?secret=FM6GyAC5si#?secret=u0qwu3cXov" data-secret="u0qwu3cXov" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other states even decrease the cost for these services. The report cited Illinois, which has a prison population similar to Virginia’s, for charging families roughly a penny per minute per call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s true the situation regarding prison communication costs is better today than the unseemly treatment families in Virginia faced at the start of the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century. Back then, WorldCom Inc. –</span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/worldcom.asp" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">which later became synonymous with accounting fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – imposed a $2.25 surcharge and up to 37 cents per minute per call.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gordon-gekko.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gordon Gekko</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have been proud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state also got a 40% commission for the punitive practice. The lucrative deal made officials slow to change the status quo. Department of Corrections bigwigs even rejected a WorldCom proposal to lower rates, The Pilot’s 2001 editorial noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much for compassion for the families. They pay the overwhelming amount of such costs because prisoners are limited in how much they collect for their labor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, the state no longer gets a commission on calls. It receives some money on a separate contract to provide tablets with products and services. Global-Tel Link now provides prison phone services in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasoul’s legislation now heads to Gov. Glenn Youngkin. A spokesman told me by email the governor is reviewing all bills that reach his desk – a typical non-indicator from this administration of which way the guv is leaning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we want people leaving jails and prisons to reintegrate into society successfully, everyone should support policies that connect people to their families. After all, many incarcerated individuals are freed each year in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nonprofit</span><a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/profiles/VA.html#:~:text=Virginia%20has%20an%20incarceration%20rate,incarcerated%20in%20Virginia%20and%20why." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Prison Policy Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, reported that nearly 300,000 people are released from state jails and prisons annually in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 95% of people incarcerated eventually return to the community at some point, Sheba Williams, founder and executive director of Richmond-based nonprofit Nolef Turns, told me in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a benefit for the community” to maintain those familial ties, added Williams, who was part of the state work group that studied onerous prison fees. “There are vendors that will provide lower costs than what the Department of Corrections has contracted for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasoul’s bill “is a step in the right direction,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandra Brandt is the longtime executive director of Norfolk-based STEP-UP Inc., which fights recidivism among former prisoners. “The rates used to be outlandish,” Brandt told me, recalling one woman who racked up a phone bill of $1,000 while contacting a relative behind bars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasoul’s legislation “will be a blessing for a lot of families,” Brandt continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bill should be an easy choice for Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can be tough on crime while also fighting recidivism. Reducing the cost of communications is one way to do just that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hungry students can’t focus on learning and comprehension. Researchers say</span><a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/news/quick-take-case-free-school-meals" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">free school meals boost attendance and improve diet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well reduce the stigma associated with children who struggle to pay in the cafeteria line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why Virginia should join a handful of pioneering states that provide free breakfasts and/or lunches to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> K-12 schoolkids, regardless of family income. Those states include</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/school-lunch-free-colorado-districts-want-meal-benefits-applications/#:~:text=Colorado%20voters%20approved%20Prop%20FF,income%20earners%20in%20our%20state" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/01/11/schools-swamped-by-lunch-debt/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">California and Maine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others have approved legislation establishing optional or mandatory universal school meal programs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/state-legislatures-news/details/new-state-and-federal-policies-expand-access-to-free-school-meals" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia state Sen. Danica Roem, a Manassas Democrat who’s authored several successful bills involving school meals since joining the General Assembly in 2018, has sponsored</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb283" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 283</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this General Assembly session. It would provide universal free breakfasts and lunches to the commonwealth’s 1.26 million public schoolchildren. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Senate committee has approved the bill, as my</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2024/01/22/legislation-calls-for-free-school-meals-for-all-virginia-students/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mercury colleague Nathaniel Cline reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The proposal would cost $346 million over the next two years. Federal funding helps pay for current free and reduced meals nationwide; Roem’s measure, using general fund money, has the state covering what the feds don’t.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have yet to hear an argument of why we shouldn’t do this” that has any validity, Roem told me. “No child should go hungry.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many low-income children, of course, are covered already by programs funded by the U.S. government. Roem’s bill –</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb686" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and one in the state House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria – would make the program free to all public schoolchildren in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s likely many wealthy and middle-income families would decline the assistance. That’s no problem: The school meals legislation provides an opt out clause for parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other families, though, would welcome the help. News stories from recent years of individual schools or divisions piling up debt because families either couldn’t pay, or because students ambled through meal lines not knowing their accounts were overdrawn, are easy to find.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William County Public Schools – the state’s second largest behind Fairfax County – ended the 2022-23 school year</span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/prince-william-students-end-the-year-with-nearly-350k-in-school-meal-debt/article_c3fcc952-f4ee-11ed-ae4c-c38e0e0fa484.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with almost $350,000 in school meal debt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Students in Henrico County public schools</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/school-meal-debt-racks-up-in-virginia-after-federal-aid-ended/article_c515ced8-db12-11ed-ae96-2b759ce6b3d5.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">had accrued more than $50,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> halfway through that year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School divisions then have to take money from other categories – such as funding for books or additional teachers –</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/01/11/schools-swamped-by-lunch-debt/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to make up the shortfall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerned residents in Virginia, like</span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/1-woman-helping-settle-school-lunch-debt-advocating/story?id=99956257" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Adelle Settle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and teacher</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/11/school-meal-debt-teacher/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gabe Segal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have pitched in to help schools eliminate their debt and end so-called “lunch shaming.” The former’s nonprofit, aptly named</span><a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/food/story/1-woman-helping-settle-school-lunch-debt-advocating-99956257" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Settle the Debt,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has even been featured on national television. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such citizen philanthropy shouldn’t be necessary, though. We can all help in much the same way that our tax dollars support teacher pay, school buses and books. Roem is fond of saying no one gets upset when students in richer communities use school buses; it’s an expected cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 283 passed 11-4 in the Senate Committee on Education and Health. One committee member, Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, said wealthy counties shouldn’t need free meals. But Roem noted that even in those localities, there can be pockets of low- and middle-income families who could use the lunch-line help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried reaching the four Republicans who voted against the bill on the panel. None of them responded to my emailed questions. (Two Republican senators voted for the measure.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My inquiries included whether the opponents favored the pending</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/15/capitals-wizards-potomac-yard-arena-finances-virginia-dc/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.35 billion taxpayer subsidy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would go to building a Northern Virginia sports arena to lure the Washington Capitals and Wizards from the District of Columbia. If approved, the funding would be the largest-ever public subsidy for a project of its kind, The Washington Post reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know we’re not talking an apples-to-apples comparison with school meals. But the two initiatives are worth examining together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a question of priorities. What kind of government spending do legislators favor? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arena deal includes a</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/13/capitals-wizards-move-alexandria-potomac-yard/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">12-acre mixed-use complex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, bond offerings and all sorts of financial projections. Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, the group that would bring the teams to Virginia, would pay $403 million up front and rent starting annually at $29.5 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential tax dollars from the complex make politicians salivate.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/15/capitals-wizards-potomac-yard-arena-finances-virginia-dc/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Youngkin has said the public money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being offered would mostly come from revenue that wouldn’t exist without the project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind, though, that Ted Leonsis, managing partner of Monumental, has a net worth of</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/theodore-leonsis/?sh=610d2e3a6e84" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.8 billion, according to Forbes.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He’s among the richest people in the world. And Virginians could be shelling out a lot of bucks for the privilege of saying: “We host major league teams!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True, free meals to students is a net revenue “loser.” But they’re an investment in human capital – akin to public libraries and recreation centers. They improve children’s lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We shouldn’t be the last state to sign on to free school meals. Our children will thank us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And they won’t risk embarrassment by asking for something to eat.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats in the Virginia General Assembly, now in charge in both chambers in the session that opened last week, hope to pass several gun-control bills. The wish list includes legislation to ban the sale of new assault weapons and large-capacity magazines,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/29/virginia-general-assembly-gun-bills-youngkin/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also want to place Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, “on the record” regarding firearms – ostensibly to mark him for any future political campaign after his four-year term ends. (Governors in Virginia are limited to one non-consecutive term.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter effort is a waste of time, though, since Youngkin has generally skirted the issue but also given no indication he’d sign something anathema to his party’s base. That’s par for the course for most GOP officeholders.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/30/guns-not-mental-illness-at-heart-of-americas-terror/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin wouldn’t even mention the word “guns”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> while addressing hundreds of people at a vigil following a mass shooting by a Chesapeake Walmart employee. I witnessed the governor’s gutlessness that night in November 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor</span><a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/169124/glenn-youngkin-supports-no-gun-control-heartbroken-walmart-shooting" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">also previously has pledged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to roll back gun control. So no one should be surprised if Youngkin mimics the party line: No new gun restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for Youngkin told me he’ll review any legislation that passes both chambers. The spokesperson didn’t respond to other questions I asked, including enunciating Youngkin’s policy toward firearms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His administration also hasn’t begun spending the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/01/after-applying-for-funding-tied-to-red-flag-law-youngkin-officials-vague-on-plans-to-use-it/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$5 million from the federal government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> awarded last February. The money will pay for mental health and substance abuse programs within the criminal justice system, Jackson Miller, director of the state Department of Criminal Justice Services, told me by email. Bureaucratic approvals for spending the grant money should be finished soon, Miller said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The emphasis, though, is clearly on promoting red flag laws – measures designed to prevent gun violence by people with a history of threatening or erratic behavior – </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-over-200-million-investments-state-crisis-intervention" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the feds noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when announcing the grants. It&#8217;s hard to believe a program Youngkin was gung-ho about would take this long to implement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This doesn’t mean Democrats should punt on firearms legislation. However, they should expend more energy on bills that could gain bipartisan backing and curtail the likelihood that individuals who would menace others could obtain guns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The best evidence supporting gun-violence-reducing effects is for legislation that places limits on who can access firearms, or that restricts the conditions of access to them,” Graham Ousey, sociology professor at the College of William &amp; Mary, told me by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Restricting purchases and requiring relinquishment for individuals convicted of violent infractions or domestic abuse, requiring waiting periods for purchases, and requiring safe storage practices and technologies are good policies and generally are better-supported by research” than bans on assault weapons, said Ousey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most firearms legislation didn’t reach the guv’s desk in his first two years in office because the Democratic-controlled Senate and then-GOP-controlled House of Delegates canceled each other out. What passed</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/17/on-guns-bipartisanship-clears-a-very-low-hurdle-in-virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tended to be non-controversial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2387" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2387</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023, a firearm safety device tax credit.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;On guns, bipartisanship clears a very low hurdle in Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/17/on-guns-bipartisanship-clears-a-very-low-hurdle-in-virginia/embed/#?secret=2EqpdETMKp#?secret=pC7M7ESfeM" data-secret="pC7M7ESfeM" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Youngkin vetoes firearms legislation this year, Democrats – who have slight majorities in both chambers – would need help from Republicans to override him. That’s not likely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why insist on pushing tough gun-control measures? Lori Haas, an advocate whose daughter was wounded in the</span><a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/massacre-at-virginia-tech-leaves-32-dead" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2007 massacre at Virginia Tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, told me the exercise is still worth it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s value for constituents and voters to know where their representatives stand on the issues,” said Haas, advocacy manager at the</span><a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/research-and-practice/center-for-gun-violence-solutions" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Gun Violence Solutions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Public Health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For instance, we know that limiting high-capacity magazines, above 10, can reduce the death toll in mass shootings,” she said. “Additionally, assault weapons put our law-enforcement officers at increased risk of harm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She pointed me to a</span><a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2021/policies-that-reduce-gun-violence-restricting-large-capacity-magazines" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which criminology professor</span><a href="https://cls.gmu.edu/people/ckoper2" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Koper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at George Mason University found assault weapons were used in 10% to 30% of fatal mass shootings. He also said they accounted for 13% of killings of law enforcement officers in the line of duty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such incidents, depressingly more common around the country, are still but a fraction of the overall number of gun-related homicides and injuries, as the</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/26/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center noted in an April 2023 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More likely are shootings that occur during arguments, robberies and narcotics beefs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the legislation on assault weapons, lawmakers have filed bills including</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB270" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HB270</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, creating uniform standards for a Virginia Firearm Buy-Back Program; and</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB55" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SB55</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, establishing a three-day waiting period for gun-buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A version of the latter bill died in 2023. The sponsor, Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, told me previously he offered the legislation because the killer in the Walmart mass shooting</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/04/despite-ceaseless-slayings-these-virginians-keep-combating-gun-violence/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">had legally bought the handgun the same day as the attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll never know if a possible “cooling-off period” may have changed Andre Bing’s mind. But we do know</span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1619896114" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">researchers found such waiting periods reduce gun homicides by 17%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bing might have skipped the purchase if he couldn’t get it right away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats could try to gain political points by showing up Youngkin. Instead, they should take the deliberative, bipartisan route to pass bills making it tougher to kill people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Readers of the nonprofit organization’s annual calendar, though, would learn just how savagely this country has treated the powerless, who often have been Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans. The day-to-day bloodshed and savagery cannot be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s why, even today, we should all fight racial stereotypes and scapegoating.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan. 3, 1895: Nineteen Hopi leaders are imprisoned on Alcatraz Island for opposing government assimilation efforts.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan. 13, 1904: A mob of white men lynches General Lee, who’s Black, for allegedly knocking on the door of a white woman’s home in Reevesville, S.C.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The calendar recounts events of naked terrorism. They usually were committed by whites who knew they wouldn’t be punished. The capacity for hate will shock those ignorant of America’s past – and present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chronology also has mini-essays detailing acts of second-class treatment, lynchings of children and</span><a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/infant-mortality-and-african-americans" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Black infant mortality rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://www.history.com/news/gi-bill-black-wwii-veterans-benefits" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.history.com/news/gi-bill-black-wwii-veterans-benefits" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1944 G.I. Bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example – designed to help military veterans with housing, education and jobs – left the administration of the law’s provisions to the states. That meant Southern states, especially, were free to discriminate against Black veterans and deny them a chance to improve their lives and enter the middle class.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feb. 23, 2020: Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, is pursued and fatally shot in a south Georgia neighborhood. No one is arrested until the lack of charges sparks widespread protests nationwide.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">April 6, 1892: A mob seizes </span></i><a href="https://sites.lib.jmu.edu/valynchings/va1892040601/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isaac Brandon from a Charles City County, Va., jail</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and lynches him on the courthouse lawn. </span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m writing about the calendar produced by the Montgomery, Ala., nonprofit for two reasons:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, folks who castigate Blacks and others for failing “to pull themselves up” should understand the multitude of actions – by legal code or common practice – that prevented racial equality in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such steps were taken to promote white supremacy. They frequently occurred through extrajudicial terror or were promulgated through legislative action.</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/17/blacks-live-every-day-with-hurdles-that-former-health-chief-tried-to-diminish/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Vestiges of those incidents</span></a><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/23/blacks-others-shouldnt-have-to-obliterate-their-presence-to-receive-fair-home-value/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">have not been extinguished</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia-based </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/14/business/navy-federal-credit-union-black-applicants-invs/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Navy Federal Credit Union</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, has the widest disparity in mortgage approval rates between white and Black borrowers of any major lender, according to a CNN analysis</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, the recounting is a reminder to people of color of how much they’ve achieved in this land </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">despite</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the huge number of events designed to kill them, steal their property or break their spirit. The fact so many people have overcome so many obstacles is a testament to resilience – and excellence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The calendar is a history of who we have been – and what we, sadly, still grapple with. We must acknowledge those incidents and work ceaselessly to do better. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly has granted the first community the ability to raise sales taxes to help build new schools or pay for major renovations. But the legislature, in its dubious wisdom, has denied that same lifeline to the second – and to most other cities and counties around the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prohibition is mystifying, even absurd.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danville Public Schools plans to use the new money to – among other things – renovate George Washington High School, which was built in 1955. The division will update infrastructure to boost access to technology, expand the library and add a STEM academy. It also will renovate Langston School, built in 1957, to allow expansion of its existing adult education offerings and will relocate the Galileo Magnet School there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m nearly Medicare-eligible. Both of those schools are older than me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-cent sales tax</span><a href="https://www.danville-va.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=4861&amp;ARC=12055" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">should generate $141 million over 20 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Danville. “We know that these needed renovations will positively affect morale, student achievement, instruction, safety and more,” Superintendent Angela Hairston said soon after Danville residents approved the increase in a November 2021 referendum. The division has 5,700 students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the tax, division spokeswoman Lanie Davis told me by email, “Projects such as these would not have been possible and would have been placed back on the back burner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We would have needed another funding source,” she continued, “such as a referendum for a general obligation bond supported by [the] real estate tax.” Many localities depend heavily on the real estate tax for basic services, and they can’t stretch that money to pay for new schools and major repairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrast Danville’s situation with what school leaders face in Stafford County.</span> <a href="https://www.staffordschools.net/cms/lib/VA01818723/Centricity/Domain/4782/Growth%20Management%20Strategies%20Presentation%20for%20Hartwood-Brent%20Community%20Meeting_030202022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The division has 1.9% growth annually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – the fastest-growing in Virginia, an official there said – and it’s the eighth-largest division in the state with nearly 32,000 students.</span><a href="https://www.staffordschools.net/domain/383" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly half the students take part in the federal free lunch program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an indicator of poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superintendent Thomas Taylor told me the system is building two elementary schools and one high school just to cope with the growth. “I also have the need to replace three schools,” he added, “but that would increase the county debt service, and that would jeopardize the bond rating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the biggest challenges are the conditions of Drew Middle School, which opened in 1951 as a high school, and Hartwood Elementary School, which opened in 1963.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drew Middle “is just falling apart,” he said. The heating,  cooling and plumbing systems are deficient; so are the roof, floors and windows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Hartwood is the only school in the county that is on well water and a septic system. Because of that, school administrators must limit the number of people who come into the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legislature provided Stafford County the option to raise the sales tax, and voters approved the levy, it would provide about $25.6 million annually. “This would be a huge tool in the toolkit,” Taylor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed it would. The fact the General Assembly has shot down attempts in recent years to allow </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">every</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> locality this mechanism doesn’t make sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Danville, my so-called “Sainted Nine” localities are the counties of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlotte, Gloucester, Halifax, Henry, Mecklenburg, Northampton, Patrick and Pittsylvania.</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/12/11/dems-reintroduce-bill-to-let-virginia-localities-fund-school-capital-projects-through-sales-tax/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As my colleague Nathaniel Cline reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, local governing bodies can adjust real estate tax rates, but they can’t change the sales tax rate unless the Assembly gives them an explicit thumbs up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators have carried previous bills that provided the Sainted Nine with this coveted financing option. Voters then must approve the tax increase in a referendum. In 2019,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/24/virginia-explained-why-can-just-nine-localities-impose-a-sales-tax-for-school-capital-projects/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Halifax County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> became the first to gain the Assembly’s blessing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent attempts, though, to expand the tool statewide have failed – often in the GOP-controlled House of Delegates. Democrats, however, will have the majority in both chambers in January and are pushing for a change; some Republicans will, too.

	</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Virginia invested nearly $1.3 billion into programs distributing grants and loans for school construction. That’s a fraction, however, of the overall need. And each year, buildings get a little older, and technology gets a little more outdated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why the previous pushback in Richmond? Two reasons are likely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One, Republicans often detest raising taxes as part of their raison d’être.</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/24/virginia-explained-why-can-just-nine-localities-impose-a-sales-tax-for-school-capital-projects/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet some Republican legislators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored the sale-tax tool when it benefited </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">their</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> constituents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, if localities are figuring out their own finances and can bypass the elected officials at the state Capitol, why do we even need those pooh-bahs?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The status and ego of the 140 legislators could take a bruising, which may or may not impact their re-election prospects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. McPike, who’s a member of the school modernization panel, said his fellow legislators should put students first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When a kid goes to school, they’re not going to a Democratic or Republican school,” he told me. “They’re going to a school with a leaky roof.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sales tax increase also captures travelers moving through a community who might sit down at a local restaurant or buy items from a merchant in town.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no reasonable explanation for why a handful of cities and counties can take advantage of this financing strategy, while the others are locked out. Let every locality win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And don’t worry, lawmakers: Your constituents will love you for this – especially the folks whose children attend classes in decaying school buildings.</span></p>

The manufacturer admits the appliance is in short supply, but  pledges to deliver the item in a couple of months – tops. You pay the hefty cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You wait. And wait some more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, you keep schlepping your dirty clothes to the laundromat, fishing around for enough quarters each week. You wonder what’s going on with your purchase. Nor can the appliance maker tell you when your machine will actually arrive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That example is similar, in a roundabout way, to the issue of getting rid of bad cops in Virginia. Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration has repeatedly delayed updating parts of a</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202+ful+CHAP0037" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 law to decertify rogue police officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, despite a deadline that’s more than a year old. What’s going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More tools to remove bad cops </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taken effect since then; the changes are an obvious improvement. They help bolster the confidence of Virginia residents toward the men and women in blue. But the administration was supposed to have approved related statewide standards</span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/viewstage.cfm?stageid=9641&amp;display=documents" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than a year ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – and still hasn’t.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-11-30/bad-police-officers-virginia-glenn-youngkin-decertification" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently reported on the foot-dragging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, Youngkin, a Republican, and his public safety officials have thumbed their noses at the law passed during the administration of Democrat Gov. Ralph Northam, which expanded reasons for officer decertification.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a bothersome precedent. It could lead to reprisals when political parties shift power, in a never-ending tit-for-tat in which duly enacted laws aren’t enforced by succeeding administrations. Ultimately, Virginians lose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m kind of mystified,” state Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax and a supporter of the 2020 law, told me in an interview. He also wondered if the administration could be sued over the delay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor “doesn’t get to pick and choose what laws he wants to follow,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We worked very closely with law-enforcement leadership to design changes to the process,” Surovell continued. Police chiefs and sheriffs had been frustrated about the inability to root out bad officers, and the options to decertify police had been limited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before 2020, departments could decertify officers only after they were convicted of felonies or specific misdemeanors, or if they refused a drug test. Nor were law-enforcement agencies always checking closely with previous employers when officers tried to relocate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Dec. 1 letter from Surovell, the Senate majority leader; Sen. Mamie Locke, the Senate Democratic Caucus chair; and Del. Don Scott, the incoming speaker of the Democratic-majority House of Delegates, asked administration officials when they intend “to comply with state law” and why the review has taken so long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law’s approval in 2020 came partly as a response to the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Virginia legislators and high-ranking police officials, however, had been seeking more ways to decertify officers long before that.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-crime-commission-examines-police-decertification-rules/article_f500e6fa-3592-5be5-be2b-b24a9d5b5971.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2012 news story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for example, noted officers in Virginia fired for criminal convictions and other infractions often kept their state certification. They could move to other jurisdictions in the commonwealth. Top police officials said they needed the state’s help to change the status quo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 1999 to early 2021,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/08/statewide-police-conduct-standards-will-soon-be-enforceable-almost-two-years-after-law-passed/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">83 law enforcement officers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and jail staff lost their ability to work in Virginia because of bad conduct. From March 2021 – when the new law took effect – through February 2023, 118 officers were decertified, according to</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23651742-va-dcjs-master-decertification-list-vfoia-2823" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">state data published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the law enforcement watchdog group</span><a href="https://openoversightva.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenOversightVA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of the latter group were decertified for false statements during internal affairs investigations, VPM reported. Others were jettisoned for infractions that included use of force violations or falsifying documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stats suggest some of those officers could’ve hung on to their jobs before the new changes.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/24/disparity-in-police-decertifications-should-alarm-virginians/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As then-Norfolk Police Chief Larry Boone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told me in 2020, if he fired an officer for using excessive force, that person could “go to another agency if that department did not come and look at his personnel records.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes in the decertification law also meant an officer could lose his credentials if he was fired or resigned for actions that compromise his “credibility, integrity, honesty, or other characteristics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another clause in the law dictated officers would be terminated if they didn’t adhere to as-yet-to-be-determined statewide standards.</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-11-30/bad-police-officers-virginia-glenn-youngkin-decertification" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As VPM reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a work group including representatives from law enforcement and criminal justice advocates developed those </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewXML.cfm?textid=16995" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It took the group nine months to reach consensus on the standards, which the Criminal Justice Services Board passed in June 2022, five months after Youngkin took office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewXML.cfm?textid=16995" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> require officers to “treat all individuals with dignity and respect” and “uphold the public trust.” The proposal spells out misconduct that can lead to decertification, including making a false arrest, tampering with evidence or a witness, or having sex with someone in custody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the regulation and several others relating to training and accountability have</span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/viewstage.cfm?stageid=9641&amp;display=documents" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent more than 470 days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under review by Youngkin’s secretary of public safety, even though state law required the standards to be passed within 280 days of the statute going into effect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Macaulay Porter, Youngkin’s spokesperson, about the delay and whether any pending reviews of other laws had taken so long. She didn’t respond to voicemail and email requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement officials and other interested parties worked diligently to craft the policies. There’s no justifiable reason for the administration’s delays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this rate, the phantom washing machine will arrive before the updated decertification standards. The administration’s tortoise-like review is indefensible – and worrisome.</span></p>

Creigh Deeds carries — both physical and psychological — since that awful day 10 years ago have propelled him to overhaul the commonwealth’s imperfect mental health system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a work in progress. Successes and setbacks continue to occur around the state:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new mental health hospital for children, a rarity nationwide, opened in Norfolk. Police officers have received</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2015/07/23/norfolks-crisis-intervention-officers-are-now-busy-making-a-difference/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">crisis intervention training to de-escalate encounters involving the mentally ill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However,</span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2019-step-va.asp#:~:text=STEP%2DVA%20is%20a%20long,services%20available%20to%20all%20Virginians." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">STEP-VA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an initiative to improve behavioral health services at the state’s 40 community service boards, has struggled. “The implementation has been challenging, and the actual cost has been elusive,” Deeds told me by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deeds took on this role after his son, Gus, attacked him during a mental health crisis and then committed suicide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Virginians owe Deeds a debt of gratitude for his unwavering focus born out of personal tragedy. We wouldn’t be as far along in boosting mental health services statewide without his relentless efforts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Certainly, my mental health policy work has become a significant part of my workload,” the Charlottesville Democrat told me, “and I expect it will be for however long I am able to serve.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/18/virginia-creigh-deeds-mental-health/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wp_dmv7&amp;wpsirc=nl_dmv7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently reported on Deeds’ crusade, a decade after the event that has since stamped his legislative career and made his name synonymous with overhauling mental health practices in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 19, 2013, Deeds’ son, Gus, stabbed him 13 times before fatally shooting himself. Gus Deeds, 24, suffered from bipolar disorder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day before the attack, the elder Deeds had gotten an emergency custody order for his son to receive treatment. But an official couldn’t find a psychiatric bed before the six-hour hold expired, and Gus Deeds was sent home with his father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Deeds suffered numerous injuries in the attack, and he nearly lost his right ear. In the immediate aftermath, his face and other parts of his body bore numerous scars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He thus became — quite literally — the face of mental health reform. He chairs the</span><a href="https://bhc.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state Behavioral Health Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, established in 2021 as a standing panel of the General Assembly. As The Post noted, Deeds has sought to overhaul the system, bringing attention to problems behind bars, for example, and trying to make it easier for young people to receive care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still hear too much about the former. Perhaps the worst case in recent years involved the death of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jamycheal Mitchell at the Hampton Roads Regional Jail in 2015.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2015/11/16/roger-chesley-jailed-mentally-ill-in-jail-and-questions-for-society/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I wrote at the time,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mitchell was jailed for reportedly stealing about $5 worth of junk food from a convenience store. </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2018/12/19/justice-department-says-hampton-roads-regional-jails-treatment-of-inmates-cruel-and-unusual-3/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a judge had ordered him to be sent to Eastern State Hospital in Williamsburg to be restored to competency. Administrative snafus prevented the transfer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell, 24, died of</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2019/01/19/3-million-settlement-reached-in-death-of-jamycheal-mitchell-at-hampton-roads-regional-jail-2/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">probable cardiac arrhythmia and wasting syndrome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to an autopsy. He had lost around 40 pounds while in jail. A lawsuit by his family, which needed then-Gov. Ralph Northam’s approval, was settled for $3 million in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/23/irvo-otienos-needless-death-exemplifies-the-criminalization-of-black-mental-illness/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvo Otieno died from asphyxiation in March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after Henrico sheriff’s deputies and Central State Hospital employees took turns kneeling on him for almost 11 minutes as he was being admitted to the psychiatric hospital.</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irvo-otieno-psychiatric-hospital-death-settlement-9528a29372f9cb7989a79a5993772c06" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">His family later agreed to an $8.5 million settlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the state and county sheriff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otieno’s relatives said he had a long history of mental health problems.</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irvo-otieno-psychiatric-hospital-death-settlement-9528a29372f9cb7989a79a5993772c06" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Several people face second-degree murder charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advances in the mental health field have occurred, thankfully. Among the brightest was the fall 2022 dedication of the</span><a href="https://www.chkd.org/support-us/support-our-mental-health-program/mental-health-hospital/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Children’s Pavilion psychiatric facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Deeds didn’t help develop the center, “his continued advocacy in the mental health arena will be essential for its continued success,” Bryant Thomas, CHKD vice president of advancement, said by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $224 million facility has annual program costs of $45 million. It features 60 inpatient rooms as well as outpatient mental health services. A CHKD spokesperson said 657 admissions occurred in the first year of operation, and 486 patients admitted to the main hospital also received mental health services in the past fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s been a lot said that this hospital is going to be the best in the state,” Deeds said at the dedication last year, “but I’ve been to a bunch of hospitals, and it’s going to be the best in the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will be a place where kids get better,” he added, “where hope is restored to families, and where others all over the country, and probably all over the world, look to for advances in research and treatment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obstacles remain toward improving mental health care in Virginia. Deeds told me the most important need is to boost the workforce. “We have shortages at a critical level for nearly every type of professional who provides services to people in need,” the senator said, though he added the problem is not unique to behavioral health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a budget deal in September that includes $58 million to expand and modernize Virginia’s crisis services system. An additional $10 million establishes mobile crisis services in underserved areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deeds, though, criticized the recent announcement</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/deputy-commissioner-behavioral-health-virginia/article_e50934b4-8b11-11ee-b87f-af3275d2ebc6.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by the administration to eliminate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a deputy commissioner post at the state</span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Richmond Times-Dispatch said the shakeup is aimed “at carrying out the ‘Right Help, Right Now’ reforms” promised by Youngkin to improve delivery of services for people facing psychiatric or substance use crises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the move comes as the governor is urging state agencies to earmark savings of up to 10% in their operating budgets. “There is certainly nothing wrong with looking for efficiencies,” Deeds said, “but I remain concerned that this administration is not looking for ways to better serve those in need, but rather is trying to justify further tax cuts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deeds will keep pointing out such shortsighted decisions. As he must — and not just in his son’s memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lives of Virginians depend on Deeds’ candor and guidance.</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="624" height="468" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_1484.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_1484.jpg 624w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_1484-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Former Newport News teacher Abigail Zwerner, 26, was shot by a 6-year-old student in January and in October, won the right to bring a $40 million lawsuit against the district. (Toscano Law Group)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the arguments over whether a former Newport News teacher can sue for damages, or should instead be limited to the remedies in Virginia’s restrictive, century-old</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title65.2/chapter1/section65.2-100/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers’ Compensation Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, lies this reality: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No educator should </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be the victim of a shooting by a student – especially when the child is only 6 years old. Could he even spell “caliber”? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That the violence occurred is a stinging indictment of both our educational system and the upbringing of some children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That, really, is at the heart of</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/04/virginia-schools-increasingly-eye-weapons-detectors-to-keep-firearms-out-of-buildings/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Abigail Zwerner’s bid to win $40 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the Newport News School Board and other defendants. A first-grader shot and seriously wounded her at Richneck Elementary School in January. She was hospitalized nearly two weeks with injuries in her hand and shoulder, and she’s undergone several surgeries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank goodness she wasn’t killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zwerner, 26, alleged school officials had ignored warnings that the boy had brought a gun to school that day and was in a violent mood. He’d previously exhibited disciplinary problems on school grounds; the lawsuit, for instance, claimed he’d choked another teacher and whipped other students with a belt. (The boy’s mother</span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/crime/deja-taylor-mother-6-year-old-who-shot-richneck-elementary-teacher-plea-hearing/291-739dd8bc-94d7-4fcb-b7af-1c43b9cdca22" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">later pleaded guilty to felony child neglect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but a charge of endangering a child by recklessly storing a gun was dropped.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circuit Court Judge Matthew Hoffman recently ruled Zwerner can continue her lawsuit instead of receiving only the benefits in the state’s workers’ comp system. The latter would provide up to nearly 10 years’ pay and lifetime medical care for her injuries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Court finds the injury suffered by Plaintiff did not arise out of her employment,” the judge wrote. “ … Defendants have not met their burden to prove the Plaintiff’s injuries fall within the exclusive coverage of the Act.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">J.H. Verkerke, a University of Virginia law school professor, told me the “probability is high that the trial court’s ruling will be overturned on appeal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The workers’ compensation system was designed to replace tort liability for workplace injuries,” he added by email, noting the law was enacted originally in 1918. “In exchange for relatively certain recovery without proving employer negligence, workers gave up the possibility of receiving compensation for pain and suffering or punitive damages.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News stories, citing legal experts, also had predicted Zwerner’s suit would fail.</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/teacher-shot-6yearold-zwerer-lawsuit-workers-compensation-48d4ea18da54ccfeb3e082902020bf6b" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported: “Lawsuits that might move forward in other states often falter in the Commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That still could happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the horror Zwerner suffered demands a re-evaluation of the stringent guidelines for workers’ comp in Virginia. Diane Toscano, Kevin Biniazan and Jeffrey Breit are representing her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The highest compensation permitted for Ms. Zwerner under the workers’ compensation remedies could never equate to a full and fair accounting for what has been taken from her,” her attorneys told me by email. “No recovery for her pain. No recovery for her mental anguish. No recovery that acknowledges the scope of injuries and the effect those injuries will have on her life tomorrow or for the rest of her life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators and residents more than a century ago couldn’t have imagined the level of violence that occurs regularly in classrooms today. Here’s what I’m talking about:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the</span><a href="https://www.nea.org/nea-today/all-news-articles/teaching-while-scared" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Education Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing a 2021-2022 survey of 15,000 teachers, administrators and other staff, found one-third of teachers reported being threatened by a student within the previous year, including verbal threats, intimidation or sexual harassment. Some 14% percent of teachers said they had been victims of physical violence from students, NEA Today reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was unable to find, though, how many 6-year-olds had brought guns to school and actually shot a school employee. My calls and emails to the NEA about such statistics weren’t returned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such incidents are probably rare, if not infinitesimal. It’s a circumstance most first-grade teachers can’t envision when entering their classrooms. It’s not a reasonable expectation for educators of very young children barely able to dress themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys for defendants in the lawsuit, including Anne Lahren,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said the circumstances of the shooting fall under the Workers’ Compensation Act guidelines. In a statement, they noted that a teacher being injured by a student “unfortunately, is a fairly common occurrence and one that is only increasing in frequency [in] this day and age.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But being shot by a first-grader? That scenario is shocking.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cpQZqzzxak"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/01/16/out-of-pocket-teacher-classroom-expenses/">Out-of-pocket teacher classroom expenses</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Out-of-pocket teacher classroom expenses&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/01/16/out-of-pocket-teacher-classroom-expenses/embed/#?secret=hwkjyuqKbM#?secret=cpQZqzzxak" data-secret="cpQZqzzxak" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked Lahren whether she and her colleagues would seek a settlement, she told me – by email – they’re not discussing that possibility for now. Lahren added they “firmly believe this is a workers’ compensation case and that the appeals court will reverse the trial court decision.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could happen. A multimillion-dollar verdict or settlement, obviously, would send tremors throughout school divisions and governing bodies around Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need a critical re-examination of workers’ comp protocols. An exemption for violent incidents – especially those on school grounds that should have been foreseeable – would force divisions to improve security and not tolerate certain behaviors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judges ultimately may order Zwerner to seek workers’ comp. Even if she’s allowed to plead her claims, she might win far less than $40 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s already made a significant contribution, though, to our knowledge about the dangers that teachers face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being shot by a 6-year-old – or any student – shouldn’t be an acceptable risk for educators.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin’s administration, including the de facto state Republican Party chief himself, can’t get voting right in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest piece of evidence is the</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/29/youngkin-virginia-elections-voter-rolls/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">purging of nearly 3,400 citizens who</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as former felons, had had their voting rights restored.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Elections announced the newest developments Oct. 27, as early voting continued for all 140 state House of Delegates and Senate contests leading up to Tuesday, Election Day. The results will determine whether Youngkin can impose an agenda that includes limiting most abortions after 15 weeks in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True, 3,400 people out of</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/registration-statistics/2023/10/oct-pdfs/Daily_Registrant_Count_By_Locality_2023_11_01_053558.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">6.12 million registered voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia is a tiny percentage. The margin of victory for state House candidates in 2021, however, was razor-thin in several contests. More on that later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Elections earlier in October (also known as ELECT) had originally</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-10-10/virginia-democrats-us-congress-voter-elect-attorney-general" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said at least 275 voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had been affected by the snafu. Staffers culled the former felons from the rolls after they removed people who committed new felonies after their rights had been restored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This already has had a chilling effect on voting,” Shawn Weneta, policy and advocacy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, told me this week. He’s a onetime felon whose rights were restored under then-Gov. Ralph Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People have gone and tried to vote [early] and been turned away,” Weneta added. “It’s an equity issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would anyone be surprised if, after Election Day, officials discovered </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">even more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than 3,400 people had been affected?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians who have faced problems include Eric Wardell, who</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-10-25/youngkin-mcdermid-virginia-inspector-general-investigate-voter-roll-removals" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">VPM News reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had petitioned Arlington County twice for reinstatement after being unable to register to vote there, even though his rights had been restored in 2019. Wardell later told the outlet he learned he’d been added to the voter rolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another was Nathaniel Hill, 59, who spoke at a news conference Wednesday in Richmond. “I paid $3,300 in taxes last year,” Hill said. “If you can accept my tax money, then you can restore my rights,” reported the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mercury’s Graham Moomaw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has ordered the state inspector general to investigate the removals. The problem, though, is that they occurred in the first place. Congressional Democrats from Virginia have</span><a href="https://bobbyscott.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bobbyscott.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.10.30-doj-letter-copy.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">asked U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to probe the issue, too</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bumbling from the current state administration speaks volumes concerning Youngkin’s overheated claims about voting when he was on the campaign trail in 2021 and what he’s actually done while in office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said back then that elections – though run well in the commonwealth –</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/10/maybe-now-we-can-lay-the-election-integrity-talk-to-rest/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">deserved greater scrutiny</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He participated in a discredited</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/08/12/28460/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“election integrity” rally in Lynchburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He played coy during the GOP nominating process about whether</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/10/maybe-now-we-can-lay-the-election-integrity-talk-to-rest/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">he believed Joe Biden had won the 2020 presidential election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Youngkin was inaugurated in early 2022, though, he and other officials have overseen a share of electoral problems. The governor also has helped worsen one of the nation’s most rigid and</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2016/05/02/roger-chesley-politics-cant-obscure-the-right-thing-to-do/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">discriminatory policies of rights restoration for felons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He could’ve endorsed a constitutional amendment that would’ve allowed automatic restoration of voting and other civil rights. (It had passed the General Assembly in 2021 and needed to pass a second time before going to Virginians in a referendum.) Instead,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/31/youngkin-seeks-the-will-of-the-people-but-only-when-its-politically-convenient/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin stayed mute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and House Republicans –</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/03/republicans-fall-in-line-against-final-push-to-expand-felon-voting-rights-in-virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">newly in charge in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – killed the bill in a subcommittee.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/23/youngkin-administration-now-requires-felons-to-apply-to-get-their-voting-rights-back/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">His administration forced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people seeking a return of those rights to apply, rather than automatically restoring them. The</span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2023-10-06/virginia-lawsuit-over-voting-rights-restoration-clears-early-hurdle" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">opaqueness of the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the criteria for restoration, led to </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-felons-restoration-virginia-naacp-youngkin-0392d38300c1e771d1190dc04a16d025#:~:text=(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Virginia%20NAACP,who%20have%20completed%20their%20sentences." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Beals, Youngkin’s elections commissioner, then pulled Virginia out of</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-joins-republican-states-pulling-out-of-multi-state-voter-list-program/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a formerly uncontroversial, multistate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program to share accurate voter rolls. The departure came even after a high-ranking state lawyer assigned to handle election issues by Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares defended the usefulness of the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC. The commonwealth had been a charter member in 2012.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/18/quitting-multistate-voter-data-program-plays-into-conspiracy-theorists-hands/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I wrote earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia’s decision to leave the program followed unhinged complaints by conspiracy theorists and some politicians. Several states with Republican leaders left the compact. Yet as I write this,</span><a href="https://ericstates.org/about/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ERIC still lists 24 states and the District of Columbia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia announced in September</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/news-releases/virginia-signs-agreements-with-six-states-as-part-of-improvements-to-accuracy-of-voter-list.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it has signed data-sharing agreements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with five states and D.C. “Virginia now updates our voter list using data coming directly from one-to-one data sharing agreements with neighboring states and partnerships with state and federal agencies,” the Department of Elections announcement read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The self-congratulatory tone, however, can’t mask the fact Virginia is reinventing a wheel that wasn’t broken. Or that the number of states in the new compact is far fewer than ERIC’s total.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the narrow results in the House of Delegates’ elections in 2021:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Democratic Party officials have pointed out their candidates lost several close contests that year. A few included the 91</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District (94 votes), 85</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District (115 votes) and 63</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rd</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> District (512 votes). They want to make sure everybody who can vote has the ability to do so and no one is disenfranchised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of “election integrity,” Youngkin and his crew should pursue “election competence.” With this administration, that’s been lacking – especially with so much at stake at the polls.</span></p>

The city erected the signs in several retail areas. (Roger Chesley/The Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandria’s City Council recently voted</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/10/14/alexandria-repeal-panhandling-law/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to repeal some restrictions on panhandling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, noting the regulations violated federal court rulings involving free speech.</span><a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/townhall-held-to-address-panhandling-concerns-in-prince-william-fairfax-counties/65-407e3da3-0a30-4c73-825f-7940a925028c" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Other localities around Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have taken</span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2017/10/11/panhandling-is-protected/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">similar actions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unanimous council vote in Alexandria, a city of 155,000, evinces compassion for people often struggling to find food, shelter – and a dose of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bigger issue, though, is this: What are communities doing to transform panhandlers’ lives so they achieve stability – and won’t shuffle along streets with a proverbial tin cup? Also, do we actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">harm</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supplicants when donating spare bills?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get the impression, based on news reports, the official response is mixed. Some officeholders wish beggars would just disappear and leave residents alone. Others actively direct panhandlers – who are often homeless – to services ranging from mental health counseling to job seeking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We try to encourage people not to give” to panhandlers but donate instead “to one of the many organizations that serve the homeless,” Mary Riley, community programs administrator in Chesapeake’s Human Services Department, told me. Signs around the city, for example, urge people to “contribute to the solution” by donating to local charities and directing the homeless population to a housing crisis hotline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years ago, Chesapeake opened a</span><a href="https://www.cityofchesapeake.net/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=183" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">resource center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where homeless individuals can take showers, wash their clothes, get a meal and receive help landing a job. Some 25 to 30 people visit the center each day, Riley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County goes even further: It runs a program called</span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/publicworks/operation-stream-shield" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Operation Stream Shield”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which homeless persons are paid to pick up litter, landscape and remove invasive plants in waterways. It started as a pilot project in 2019 and now includes nonprofit organizations that partner with the county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The locality copied the idea from a program that began in 2015 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, called</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s A Better Way.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That city wanted to reduce panhandling, remove litter and provide dignity through work. (The city has since overhauled the program using a “a holistic approach to do case management and other supportive services,” Heidi Shultz, Albuquerque homeless program division manager, told me this week.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several communities around the country – including</span><a href="https://whyy.org/articles/new-philly-work-program-offers-alternative-to-panhandling/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Philadelphia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/local/2022/08/06/okc-program-helps-panhandlers-homlessness-jobs-housing/65388965007/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Oklahoma City</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – have adopted components of Albuquerque’s original model, tailoring it to their own circumstances and goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Philadelphia, for example, the program uses a lottery to select who “won” the chance to work that day. The lucky few earn $50 for a half-day’s work cleaning up streets around the City of Brotherly Love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pat Herrity is Springfield’s longtime representative on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. He said ending panhandling is a public safety issue, too. People begging on roadways put themselves and motorists at risk – the latter as they slow down while being generous. They could get rear-ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve all seen close calls,” Herrity told me Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The county’s clean-up program last year collected 270 tons of litter and 373 bags of invasive plants, he said. Some 30 participants garnered full-time employment, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s impressive. Maybe even life-changing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re like me, you probably go through a range of emotions when encountering panhandlers: Many look vulnerable, especially elderly women and adults who bring children with them. They pull at our heartstrings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or they may be on a never-ending grift, taking advantage of our sympathy – and naiveté. Some may look intimidating. “I’ve had businesses tell me that employees have left to go panhandle” because it’s more lucrative, Herrity said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riley, from Chesapeake, calls some beggars “professionals” who raise a lot of money but aren’t homeless. That’s not always the case, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is giving a couple of bucks, or even a couple of Lincolns, so bad? Or does such generosity do more harm than good, allowing people to use the cash for drugs or alcohol?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember a column I wrote for</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginian-Pilot in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which I’d interviewed a frequent panhandler who was begging along an interstate exit in Virginia Beach. He was well known to local police.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aBevXkuMsl"><p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/" target="_blank">Give panhandlers a new task</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Give panhandlers a new task&#8221; &#8212; The Virginian-Pilot" src="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/03/22/give-panhandlers-a-new-task/embed/#?secret=cS3P0EslGb#?secret=aBevXkuMsl" data-secret="aBevXkuMsl" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same day the column ran, a guy called me claiming to know the panhandler and his family. He said the panhandler was playing on the goodwill of people, had a home to live in and wasn’t destitute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My takeaway? We simply don’t know all the circumstances when we encounter folks begging for help – and looking like they need it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why the responses in places like Chesapeake and Fairfax County are laudable. Some people will always try to get over. Others, though, would jump at a chance to put away their tin cups. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The league is a nonprofit association of cities, towns and a few counties. VML representatives who supported re-examining the law may not know about the</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2008/07/16/chandler-family-remembers-loved-one-with-roadside-sit-in/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">police-involved death of Raymond C. Chandler in Norfolk back in 2000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here, then, is a painful refresher course – and why so many state legislators want to reduce unnecessary interactions between law-enforcement officers and motorists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chandler, who was Black, was driving to work as a security guard late at night when Norfolk police officers pulled him over for an unregistered license plate, according to newspaper archives. Officers asked for his driver’s license and registration, which he didn’t turn over; his license had been suspended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police told Chandler they were going to arrest him. A struggle took place. Police pepper-sprayed him and placed him face down on the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chandler had an enlarged heart, among other health problems. He died shortly afterward. The officers in the Chandler case eventually were cleared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chandler shouldn’t have been behind the wheel, of course. He also should’ve listened to police. But losing your life in an incident that began over an unregistered plate is a severe, unfathomable penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor do we hear about the many cases where police stop motorists, often fishing for nonexistent felonies, and find zilch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such encounters heighten the risks for citizens and police officers alike. They also antagonize drivers who are guilty of, at worst,  low-level traffic violations. They damage the relationship between police and the greater community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw this more recently when</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/14/unnecessary-opportunities-for-strife-and-use-of-force-its-time-to-re-evaluate-police-traffic-stops/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Windsor officers drew their guns and pepper-sprayed Army Lt. Caron Nazario, who is Black and Latino,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in December 2020. They had stopped him over a “missing” rear license plate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except Nazario had a temporary plate in the SUV’s window. Video of the incident went viral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black and brown people are disproportionately the recipients of this type of treatment, even with the 2020 law.</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD340/PDF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">State data of police stops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for July 2022-March 2023, for example, show that 30.4% of Virginia resident drivers stopped were Black, though they comprise only 19.4% of the state’s driving-age population. Black drivers also were searched and arrested at slightly higher rates than white drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/03/progressive-groups-blast-virginia-municipal-league-over-traffic-stop-stance/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mercury colleague Graham Moomaw reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the 2020 law doesn’t erase specific equipment violations from the books, but it prevents police from using them as the primary reason to stop motorists. It’s a way to protect motorists of color from biased treatment on state roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican legislators criticized the bill at the time of its debate and passage. Democrats controlled both chambers and the governor’s seat back then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, dozens of localities in VML, including Chesapeake, voted for the General Assembly to review the law. Chesapeake Mayor Rick West told me the city’s police chief and other Hampton Roads police departments have found such stops are effective in fighting crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pulling cars over for small events has led to the confiscation of illegal drugs, the confiscation of illegal guns, finding wanted criminals and preventing crimes,” West said. “My main reason is that the good outweighs the bad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several progressive groups in Virginia, though, castigated the VML’s debate even before members voted – and with good reason. Those groups, including Justice Forward Virginia and the state ACLU,</span><a href="https://justiceforwardva.com/blog/2023/10/2/rescind-support-for-racial-profiling" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote to the VML</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Oct. 2, saying such “pretextual policing” – the practice of stopping motorists for minor offenses in hopes of searching for more serious crimes – “has become synonymous with racial profiling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter continued: “ … Philando Castile, Samuel DuBose, Daunte Wright, and many others all were killed at the hands of police after an encounter that began with a ‘pretextual hunch.’ ” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Castile’s slaying in 2016 was especially egregious. Castile had told the Minneapolis-area police officer who stopped him that he had a gun, which he had a permit for. His girlfriend, who was in the car, said he was reaching for his driver’s license and registration when the officer fatally shot him.</span></p>

The same article said a Minnesota</span><a href="http://www.irpumn.org/uls/resources/projects/aggregate%20report%2092303.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-commissioned study in 2003 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">found “minority drivers were more likely than white drivers to be both stopped and searched, even though officers found contraband more often when searching white drivers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffrey Fagan, a professor at Columbia Law School, studies policing, crime and race. He told me that pretextual stops are legal, but problematic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes the police workplace a little less safe,” Fagan said during a phone interview. “It aggravates racial disparities. It’s hard to find something good to say about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, by email, Fagan continued: “It seems irresponsible (to me) that police would argue for more frequent interactions with civilian drivers, knowing that those interactions have little impact on crime and increase danger for both police and drivers (and some passengers).</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>

(Suffolk Schools/YouTube)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publicity surrounding the</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/09/15/suffolk-school-board-in-the-spotlight-after-refusing-to-allow-prayer-during-meeting/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">temporary shutdown of a recent school board meeting in Suffolk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – sparked by a citizen asking if she could pray publicly for the division as the 2023-24 year approached – is yet the latest example of some Christians complaining they’re under siege in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially when Christians account for nearly two-thirds of all Americans,</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/09/13/modeling-the-future-of-religion-in-america/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Pew Center estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That number far outpaces people who aren’t affiliated with any religion at 30% and adherents of all other religions – including Jews, Muslims and Hindus – at 6%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mini-controversy in Virginia encompasses a slew of issues: transgender policies in schools; the</span><a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/bill-of-rights-transcript#toc-amendment-i" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">First Amendment clauses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about free speech and making no law respecting an establishment of religion; and the common courtesy we should practice while acknowledging, in government spaces, that one person’s sincere profession of faith isn’t always welcomed by others.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www2.cbn.com/news/us/school-board-meeting-erupts-lords-prayer-after-woman-told-she-cant-openly-pray-students" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservative media outlets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and some Christian groups – including the Founding Freedoms Law Center, the legal arm of the Family Foundation – say praying Virginians, including those at the Suffolk school board meeting, are being censored. That’s an overstated, cynical tack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some background:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comments from several Suffolk citizens at the</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekRTEZBiinQ" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Aug. 10 school board meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on policies affecting transgender students, including which bathrooms and locker rooms they should use, and the rights parents should have regarding their own children. The state Department of Education under Gov. Glenn Youngkin had recently enacted its</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/07/23/virginia-transgender-model-policies-faq/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">model policies for transgender students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in K-12 schools, directing students to use facilities that match their biological sex and making it harder to change their names or pronouns at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As The Washington Post reported, the</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/07/23/virginia-transgender-model-policies-faq/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">model policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are not law or stiff requirements, and this administration’s guidance is less friendly to transgender students than former Gov. Ralph Northam’s. (That should be no surprise given Youngkin’s early</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-2-School-Mask-Mandate-Executive-Order-Exception.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order on parental rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He hyped the issue on the way to narrowly winning the gubernatorial contest in 2021.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that Suffolk School Board meeting, parent Angela Kilgore, whose youngest child had recently graduated, went to the podium. “It takes all of us as a collective community to raise these children, not just Suffolk Public Schools,” Kilgore said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then: “If you guys don’t mind, I’d like to pray for Suffolk Public Schools with all of you.” Board Chairman Tyron Riddick warned that wasn’t allowed. Kilgore left the podium.</span></p>

(Suffolk Schools/YouTube)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I love prayer,” Riddick said. “But this is not the place, per the law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several people then began saying aloud the Lord’s Prayer, with some standing. Riddick called for a recess and asked for officers to clear the room. That was perhaps an overreaction, but he was trying to maintain the rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the meeting, the Christian law center sent a letter to the school board saying it was “impermissible viewpoint discrimination to exclude religious perspectives from a public forum,” citing court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilgore told me last week the prayer by folks in the audience was spontaneous. She said she had no prior affiliation with the law center and that it contacted her later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Navy veteran said “God’s moving me.” That spurred her to ask to pray for the school division.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t know how political education had become,” Kilgore continued. “With all the turmoil going on, the tension, I wanted to pray for everybody to come together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe Kilgore. But I also think the center and Victoria Cobb, president of the Family Foundation, saw an opportunity to flog the issue to claim religious persecution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school board’s attorney countered the Founding Freedoms Law Center’s missive by sending it a letter of his own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A policy that may incidentally burden religion may nevertheless be considered neutral and withstand constitutional challenge under the Free Exercise Clause,” Wendell Waller wrote. He cited court decisions allowing “limited public forums” like school board meetings to apply restrictions, as long as they are “reasonable and viewpoint neutral.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cobb, by email Wednesday, said the following: “Religious speech should be allowed in the same way that non-religious speech is. The Constitution doesn’t allow governments to disfavor only the religious speech of its citizens.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I side with Suffolk officials. What the board wanted to do was keep the meeting on task and not veer into a whole host of prayers from speakers of various religions, then and in the future. Waller also wrote that the board has a policy prohibiting “expressive activities” and “not just religious expressions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you remember a</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35U4t8yaZDo" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Snickers candy commercial produced in 1996</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is a parody of such prayer-making. I immediately thought of it when the kerfuffle in Suffolk arose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In it, a football coach is prepping his team for a game. “This year we gotta be a little more ‘politically correct’ with the team prayer,” he says, sneering a tad. “Hit it padre.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Catholic priest, Jewish rabbi, Native American elder, bhagwan and others make brief prayers for health and victory for the players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not going anywhere for a while?” an offscreen narrator intones. “Grab a Snickers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The humor is in how Americans bend over backward to be fair when it comes to religion. What’s left unsaid, though, is that if the government puts its thumb on the scale for one religion over another, it invariably suggests the government favors the former.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t have that in the United States. We decry such tyranny in theocracies or fundamentalist countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all can pray for our school divisions – silently, aloud at home, in places of worship. Some rules apply in public forums that indeed seem harsh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits, though, outweigh the drawbacks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cruel irony? Those African Americans whose homes were snatched, often legally by utilizing eminent domain, weren’t welcomed at those same universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those property seizures are a stain on the commonwealth. They were racist in result – and often in intent, too,</span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-virginia-college-expanded-by-uprooting-black-neighborhood" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to some published accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They destroyed Black middle-class communities or prevented those locales from gaining such status.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Eminent domain and Virginia institutions of higher learning</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eminent domain allows governments to take private property for public use, even if the landowners don’t want to sell. (This was far different from the vigilante terror that destroyed places like</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/24/us/tulsa-race-massacr" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Wall Street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Tulsa, Okla., in 1921.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People saw black neighborhoods as bad neighborhoods that should be cleared,” said Dana Berliner, litigation director and senior vice president of the</span><a href="https://ij.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Institute for Justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a libertarian, nonprofit public-interest law firm based in Arlington County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The whole structure of how eminent domain works, and what is allowed to justify it,” Berliner told me, “is very much stacked against African American neighborhoods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mid-20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century was a time when African Americans had limited options of where they could live and run businesses. Redlining, </span><a href="https://mappingcville.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restrictive covenants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://detroitmi.gov/sites/detroitmi.localhost/files/2022-12/Historical%20Account_Ossian%20Sweet_0.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">white hostility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and violence crammed many Black people into ghettos. African Americans had few ways to challenge the abusive land takings because they lacked political clout in the South before the</span><a href="https://virginia.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/0fde9f85-004d-42f1-a841-37182ef82c89/0fde9f85-004d-42f1-a841-37182ef82c89/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> became law in 1965.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are reminded of this sordid history about colleges in the commonwealth – or for folks like me, initially learned about it – because of two recent articles by the Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism at WHRO, a public radio station in Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first story covered</span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-virginia-college-expanded-by-uprooting-black-neighborhood" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the creation of the campus of Christopher Newport University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Newport News. The</span><a href="https://vcij.org/stories/virginias-public-universities-have-a-long-history-of-displacing-black-residents" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">second relayed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the expansions of Old Dominion University in Norfolk and the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seizure of properties for what became CNU was an “egregious wrong,” Anthony Santoro, the university’s president from 1987 to 1996, told the news outlet. “Historically, the city (of Newport News) has to own up to the fact that this was a deliberate attempt to get rid of a Black community, because there were many places that the school could have been built.”</span></p>

<a href='https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/18/eminent-domains-long-ago-racism-still-hinders-african-americans-today/cnu-aerial-2023/'><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CNU-Aerial-2023-1024x576.png" class="attachment-large size-large" alt="" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CNU-Aerial-2023-1024x576.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CNU-Aerial-2023-300x169.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CNU-Aerial-2023-768x432.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CNU-Aerial-2023-1536x864.png 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CNU-Aerial-2023.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar events occurred at ODU and U.Va., where the use or threat of eminent domain removed thriving areas. The former’s expansion in the 1960s and ’70s swallowed up much of the middle-class Black community of Lamberts Point in Norfolk, including houses, grocery stores and churches. The latter’s growth obliterated several Black neighborhoods in Charlottesville. Meanwhile, the city itself seized communities like Vinegar Hill, a Black section of commerce, under the banner of proposed urban renewal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cities and housing authorities had to prove part of a neighborhood was “blighted” to exercise eminent domain, but the level of proof was woefully low. Property owners rarely got fair value for the parcels and homes they lost. They had to move to areas without the same amenities and services. Gone was the support system that helped make their neighborhoods their own pride and joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Americans suffered disproportionately nationwide, too, from the condemnations – and not just by universities. Local and state governments often used them to build highways, K-12 schools and other public projects.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://ij.org/report/eminent-domain-african-americans/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eminent Domain and African Americans,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 2007 report for the Institute of Justice, found that between “1949 and 1973 … 2,532 projects were carried out in 992 cities that displaced one million people, two-thirds of them African American.” That made Blacks “five times more likely to be displaced than they should have been given their numbers in the population.” Blacks were about 12% of the population then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was not a coincidence.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lasting impact, widening wealth gap</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passing real estate down to heirs is one of the key ways families accumulate wealth. The seizing of properties decades ago stunted a path to prosperity for many African Americans, who already faced the legacies of slavery, Jim Crow, lynchings and second-class citizenship designed to crush their souls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no surprise, then, that the wealth gap between whites and Blacks remains so wide today: In 2019, the median wealth of Black households</span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/eliminating-black-white-wealth-gap-generational-challenge/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the United States was $24,100, compared with a whopping $189,100 for white households</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those figures help explain why many African Americans continue to struggle to get ahead today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across Virginia, eminent domain–related decisions involving capital projects have nearly obliterated memories of many Black communities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build the Pentagon in 1942,</span><a href="https://historyfortomorrow.org/story/eminent-domain-and-the-displacement-of-black-communities/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the federal government condemned East Arlington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, giving residents there less than a month to move.</span><a href="https://historyfortomorrow.org/story/eminent-domain-and-the-displacement-of-black-communities/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Queen City, another nearby Black community</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was razed to help provide commuter access. A</span><a href="https://boundarystones.weta.org/2018/03/23/right-out-our-front-door-pentagon-east-arlington-and-queen-city#footnote-14" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">highway consultant said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time the new road network “takes out some troublesome darkey slave cabins” and “cleans up that strip.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction of Interstate 95 in the 1950s through Richmond</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-03-07/reconnect-jackson-ward-interstate-95-cap-grant" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ran through Jackson Ward, displacing thousands of Black residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The completion of I-464 in Chesapeake in the 1980s</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2016/02/13/roger-chesley-an-ominous-echo-in-south-hill/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">cut off the South Hill neighborhood from its surroundings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as recently as 2017, a small community of freed slaves’ descendants </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/as-data-centers-bloom-a-century-old-african-american-enclave-is-threatened/2017/07/02/f33db65a-5502-11e7-a204-ad706461fa4f_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had faced removal from their land in Prince William County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of the proposed development of a 38-acre computer data center. The plan eventually was jettisoned.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steven Woolf was lead author of a 2021 study titled “Deeply Rooted: History’s Lessons for Equity in Northern Virginia.” It included a section on eminent domain and the displacement of Black communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We take the position [that] the majority of this was systemic racism,” said Woolf, director emeritus and senior advisor at the Virginia Commonwealth University Center on Society and Health. The study also focused on topics including education and jobs.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Next steps</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though eminent domain is still legal, “It’s not being done in the draconian way it was done [before] with the wholesale destruction of black neighborhoods,” he added. However, several U.S. policies continue to contribute to the racial wealth gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what should happen now, decades after the worst abuses of eminent domain occurred?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woolf said he and his colleagues did suggest the “R” word – reparations – for the loss of property.</span><a href="https://historyfortomorrow.org/resources/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentions a program in</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/27/us/evanston-illinois-reparations-housing-discrimination-expand/index.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBlack%20Residents%20that%20lived%20in,their%20direct%20descendants%20are%20eligible.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Evanston, Ill., that awarded $25,000 to a specific, limited number of Black households</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use for home repairs or as down payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a loaded topic. That doesn’t mean it should be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We must acknowledge the property seizures that took place throughout Virginia’s history as ugly and racist, as they indeed were. The use of eminent domain had an outsized impact on African Americans, who have constantly struggled against a stacked deck. The loss of homes and communities reversed Black progress.</span></p>

Wildwood, like many beach communities throughout the United States, is looking for a successful and busy summer season after staying mostly closed or partially open last summer due to Covid-19 restrictions. Many resort community retail businesses are also suffering from a shortage of labor as some workers are choosing to stay home and others have changed career paths.

A constant trickle of laborers has returned to restaurants, retail outlets and offices since the worst of COVID-19 forced Americans to quit their jobs or work remotely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses, chambers of commerce and lawmakers say the hoped-for flood of workers hasn’t reappeared since before the pandemic struck in early 2020. Much wailing about vacancies continues, including at the recently concluded</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/28/whos-going-to-work-there-lawmakers-grapple-with-labor-shortages/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Conference of State Legislatures in Indianapolis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators from around the country suggested incentives like child care, affordable housing and mental health services as ways to lure people off the couch and back to work. All of that’s welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I don’t weep for the employers whose policies and stingy pay convinced people that risking their lives during a pandemic was foolish, perhaps suicidal. Discerning Virginians are now assessing their own cost-benefit analysis before they punch the clock again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They want to ensure the work-family-life balance is recalibrated in their favor. They have a different perspective after watching relatives, co-workers and friends die from COVID-19; it has</span><a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">killed more than 1.13 million Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and hospitalized more than 6.27 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means employers have to think differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re someone who owns a business, man it’s tough. … You need to pay more,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alice Louise Kassens, an economics professor and senior analyst at the Roanoke College Institute for Policy and Opinion Research, told me.</span><b> “</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re the supplier – people, households and workers – then it’s a pretty good situation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folks around the state aren’t lazy, said Jay Speer, executive director of the Virginia Poverty Law Center, assailing an oft-leveled complaint. “They need stability,” he told me. “But they don’t want crappy jobs for crappy pay.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;VPLC’s invitation to Oliver Anthony: Join us!&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/31/vplcs-invitation-to-oliver-anthony-join-us/embed/#?secret=XqQtuhNjA7#?secret=HXwSpFGeeF" data-secret="HXwSpFGeeF" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re willing to flex their muscles – and they should.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My view is the labor market should be seen as robust. The state’s</span><a href="https://www.vec.virginia.gov/node/17700" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">unemployment rate in July was just 2.5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, slightly less than the same period in 2022 and a percentage point below the national rate. It was the most recent month available as I wrote this. Those stats should be applauded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The labor force participation rate, which measures the proportion of the civilian population aged 16 and older that has a job or is actively looking for work, increased by 0.1 percentage points to 66.7% in July in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The highest labor participation rate in the state was nearly 71% in 1992, said Timothy Aylor, a senior economist with the Virginia Employment Commission. His statistics go back to 1990. The lowest participation rate was 63.4% in June 2020, a few months into the pandemic after many workplaces had shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t fully understand” why some job-seekers are still on the sidelines, Aylor told me, though “there remains a big skills mismatch between what employers need and what the unemployed have to offer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kassens said employers and government officials can entice potential workers in a variety of ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing job training for work that actually exists is one method, she noted. Raising pay is another, as is making child care more accessible and more affordable for parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Easing immigration rules – a potential non-starter for some politicians – would also add to the labor pool, Kassens added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing is clear: The canard that people would rather get jobless benefits –</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/27/unemployment-benefits-arent-the-only-thing-keeping-workers-at-home/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">including $300 a week from the feds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – than find work should be buried, once and for all. Those enhanced benefits ended roughly two years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/04/theres-an-easy-fix-for-complaints-about-a-labor-shortage-cutting-benefits-isnt-it/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">rich chamber of commerce types</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier denigrated the unemployed essentially as being lazy, and that the jobless should be pushed to return to restaurants and hotels – and risk their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those benefits had truly kept people home, though, the labor participation rate would be even higher now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not saying employers can find everybody they need. Professions like air traffic controllers and policing</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/27/labor-shortages-air-traffic-health-care-teachers-police" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are truly stressed, according to a recent Axios article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Help Wanted” signs or internet job postings are easy to find elsewhere, especially in restaurants, clothing stores and certain specialty businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jobs are here for everybody,” Nate Phillips, a manager at a Chili’s restaurant in Chesapeake, told me last week. A sign on the front door seeking “Chili Heads” touted perks including medical benefits, help with education costs and so-called “competitive” salaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The job market is hot,” Phillips continued, noting he had openings for servers, a bartender and kitchen staff. “I did four interviews yesterday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet he acknowledged people were voting with their feet, too. “Turnover is really high,” he said. Some of his employees “just get better offers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fancy that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies should get creative with their hiring strategies, obviously. Boost pay. Improve the working environment. Create clear management tracks for people who desire them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That way, both employers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employees would get what they want. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, suspects in many real-life campus attacks in the commonwealth and elsewhere</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2017/04/16/editorial-remembering-tech-victims-10-years-on/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">revealed disturbing signs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that something was “off,” they were prone to violence or were otherwise psychologically troubled. People who knew them attest they were unstable – at least in retrospect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They weren’t strangers at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surviving such incidents – and recognizing clues about potential harm from individuals – are discussed in the seven-minute video called “Active Attacker Training and Response.” The emergence of the video,</span><a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2023/07/u-va-quietly-requires-students-to-complete-active-attacker-module-training" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">first reported in The Cavalier Daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, comes after authorities say a U.Va. student killed three football players and wounded two other students last November on a charter bus returning to campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s lamentable that students must now add this type of video to their toolbox, like some required university-wide course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007 to</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/us/bridgewater-college-shooting-wednesday/index.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridgewater College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, from</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2008/02/14/us/0214-SHOOTING_index.html?smid=url-share" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Northern Illinois University in 2008</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><a href="https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2023/05/24/michigan-state-mass-shooting-youtube-videos-campus-tours-anthony-mcrae/70251301007/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan State in February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we’ve all become increasingly familiar with deadly gun violence on campuses of higher learning. It would be a dereliction of duty if administrators didn’t arm students with more techniques to avoid injuries – and death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Students will be required to complete the active attacker training and response module every two years,” U.Va. spokeswoman Bethanie Glover told me by email, noting it was produced specifically for Jefferson’s university. “Faculty and staff are strongly encouraged to view the video as well. Over 5,800 employees have completed the active attacker module thus far.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fall semester begins today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We recognize that some students may not wish to view the video due to a personal experience with past trauma,” Glover continued. “As such, we will grant an exemption to anyone who requests it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such exemptions probably do more harm than good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone should be aware of the “Run, Hide, Fight” protocol that’s touted in the video; it could mean the difference between life and death.</span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/video-repository/run-hide-fight-092120.mp4/view" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The FBI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developed the practice and it’s been used for decades,</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/31/us/run-hide-fight-active-shooting-guidance/index.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to published reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, authorities suggest people faced with armed attackers should first run from the threat if possible until they can get somewhere safe. If running isn’t possible, they should hide and barricade themselves – in a locked office, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And lastly, fight the attacker – preferably as a group – with whatever makeshift or other weapons they can find. Is a fire extinguisher, garbage can, pole or something similar available? Put the items to use. That beats confronting a shooter with nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The staged demonstration on U.Va.’s campus in the video may trigger some students. The double entendre wasn’t intended, I’m sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But students, faculty and staff would be better off knowing the best ways to respond instead of seeking an exemption. Too many mass shootings have occurred on college campuses, in</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/30/guns-not-mental-illness-at-heart-of-americas-terror/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">retail stores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/02/virginias-largest-city-joins-an-ever-expanding-grisly-list/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">municipal centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for us to ignore such threats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not entirely common. They’re no longer unique, either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extent to which such videos are effective is debatable, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor told</span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/education/uva-mandates-students-complete-active-shooter-training-before-classes/article_dd238d88-3181-11ee-bc40-3bc441ee141f.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The (Charlottesville) Daily Progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Still, I’ve got to believe some training beats no preparation whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia said</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title23.1/chapter8/section23.1-805/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">state code requires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that each public college or university have a threat assessment team. There’s no legislation mandating the video training similar to what U.Va. has implemented, though, Bob Spieldenner told me by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stylistically,</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VcSwejU2D0" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the nearly six-minute “Run. Hide. Fight.” video</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that Norfolk State University offers its students is more realistic; actors don’t break the third wall, as in the U.Va. video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The setting is a tall office building. The shotgun-wielding attacker isn’t masked. He guns down a security guard and various employees a little more than a minute into the footage, repeatedly firing at random.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter video urges everyone to have a plan in case the unthinkable happens. “Unfortunately, you need to be prepared for the worst,” the narrator warns. “ … First and foremost, if you can get out, do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember the most important thing is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not your stuff, he says. Leave belongings behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready Houston produced the video, according to the YouTube spot.</span><a href="https://www.readyhoustontx.gov/?fbclid=IwAR33ZELy-h2HwYMeDSLetmeOyhe42RrsnsVDgTZqYGB8_6pDwzSbKhbI8MA" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready Houston</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which  provides emergency preparedness information for a region in Southeast Texas,  has created footage to help train citizens in a variety of situations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial decision to shutter the sites</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/27/gop-electoral-boards-move-to-cut-richmond-early-voting-sites-may-have-been-illegal/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">even violated state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Starlet Stevens, Richmond Electoral Board chairwoman and one of two Republicans on the three-person body, told me she had favored saving the $100,000 cost instead of staffing the two centers over 45 days in South Richmond and at City Hall downtown. They’re both along public transit lines</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/richmond-board-elections-poll-rescind/article_eda674c4-32d8-11ee-8285-633cdb42cefc.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and in mainly Black and Latino neighborhoods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My only reason was financial,” she told me during an interview Wednesday. “We’re just looking at the big picture.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True, only a little more than 2,800 people voted in the fall 2022 election at the satellite offices. The city now has 169,000 registered voters, so 2,800 is a small fraction of the total number of registered voters or the typical turnout for elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Stevens missed an even bigger picture:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any time officials in Virginia make it more difficult for Black and Latino citizens to vote, they should expect civil rights groups, advocacy organizations and Democratic Party honchos – who depend on those votes – to howl in response. And with good reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They smell voter suppression, even though the Richmond GOP called such accusations “completely false.” Republicans now hold the majority on electoral boards in Virginia since the governor is from that party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s longtime hostility toward African Americans at the ballot box , however, is well-documented. The mechanism has</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2016/05/02/roger-chesley-politics-cant-obscure-the-right-thing-to-do/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">included poll taxes, literacy tests and the permanent disenfranchisement of felons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who are</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-felony-convictions-lawsuit-af720e316859e25b2e99ab8e69ee4af9" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">disproportionately Black</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Such enmity has come primarily from conservatives.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;FOIA Friday: What Virginia officials withheld or disclosed, July 14–July 21, 2023&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/21/foia-friday-what-virginia-officials-withheld-or-disclosed-july-14-july-21-2023/embed/#?secret=LMByhnvG6D#?secret=54u9ogg09b" data-secret="54u9ogg09b" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, Richmond city officials had said they’d budgeted money in the fiscal year that started July 1 to cover the costs of operating the two satellite sites. Stevens acknowledged the general registrar has more money this year than in previous ones, though she told me she was focused on getting new voting equipment and looking into added security for poll workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a poor excuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe if the Republican Party’s de facto capo, Donald Trump, hadn’t made such a big stink about early voting, observers wouldn’t be so quick to denigrate GOP motives. In previous years, the former president</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/12/republicans-early-voting-mail/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lambasted early and absentee voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as gateways to widespread fraud, even though he had no proof to support those bogus claims.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4120333-trump-records-video-encouraging-republicans-to-vote-early/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump recently encouraged Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to vote early, though his message has sometimes been muddled, according to news reports.</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/11/stop-sitting-on-the-sidelines-youngkin-pushes-gop-to-embrace-early-voting/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month also publicized the benefits of early voting, as he seeks to boost GOP turnout as this fall’s General Assembly elections approach.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AgYUhhdgtX"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/11/stop-sitting-on-the-sidelines-youngkin-pushes-gop-to-embrace-early-voting/">‘Stop sitting on the sidelines’: Youngkin pushes GOP to embrace early voting</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;‘Stop sitting on the sidelines’: Youngkin pushes GOP to embrace early voting&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/11/stop-sitting-on-the-sidelines-youngkin-pushes-gop-to-embrace-early-voting/embed/#?secret=QoDBGIZRMP#?secret=AgYUhhdgtX" data-secret="AgYUhhdgtX" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Richmond voters, another complication was the 2020 relocation of the general registrar’s office</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/grtc-to-launch-special-shuttle-service-for-early-voting-in-richmond/article_2413e17f-4e56-504e-a07e-c7775b95c85d.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from downtown City Hall to an industrial area on West Laburnum Avenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the northern tip of the city. That site allows early voting, too, but it’s not easy to reach for people who rely on public transportation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We of course were completely opposed to closing (satellite locations), whether they had the law on their side or not,” Joan Porte, president of the nonpartisan League of Women Voters of Virginia, told me. “We support equity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jane Newell is with the league’s metro Richmond chapter. She noted the November elections are critical for Southside Richmond voters, since a pending referendum involves a proposed casino-resort in their own community. Having a satellite office to vote early makes it easier for people with more than one job or who don’t have cars, Newell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She attended recent electoral board meetings about the issue. “I reminded them the League was very much in favor of satellites in Richmond,” Newell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond board did jettison Sunday voting as Election Day approached. Black churches often touted those Sundays as part of the</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/22/977929338/black-church-leaders-in-georgia-on-the-importance-of-souls-to-the-polls" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Souls to the Polls”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative, in which they encouraged congregants to use the opportunity to vote early. League of Women Voters officials and folks like Mayor Levar Stoney lamented the decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ensuring proper access to the ballot box is neither a Democrat nor Republican issue, it’s an American issue,” Stoney said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a factor in opening satellite offices, but it’s not the only one. Voter access, convenience and fairness should take precedence. Especially in a place like Virginia, which has a blatantly biased history regarding enfranchisement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely, Republicans know that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest bit of nonsense occurred in Newnan, Ga., near Atlanta.</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-fisherman-repeatedly-confronted-white-neighbors-ask-s-rcna96310" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthony Gibson was approached by a woman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> questioning why he was using a residents-only pond in his own neighborhood. The avid fisherman, who’s Black, had fielded so many annoying queries that he began posting the encounters</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fishingbay2ga" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Police were called on him at least once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gibson told NBC News two white men fishing nearby had been dipping their poles in the pond for seven years and never been questioned – even though they didn’t live there. Fancy that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incident reminded me of one</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2011/02/28/incident-at-pool-is-a-reminder-of-time-we-thought-had-long-past/?clearUserState=true" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I covered in Chesapeake years ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A young Black woman who lived in a pricey subdivision was interrogated about using the private community pool there in 2009.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t look like you live in the neighborhood and you need to get out,” a white official in the homeowners association told her, according to a lawsuit Brandy Hudgins filed in circuit court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she wouldn’t show the official her pool key, he called police. They arrived, the recent Hampton University graduate showed them her driver’s license and pool key, and police told the official to leave Hudgins alone. Her $850,000 lawsuit was later settled out of court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marvin Chiles, assistant professor of African American history at Old Dominion University, told me Wednesday these incidents often happen in communities where middle-class Blacks and whites are just starting to live together. Biases are at play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many people believe that if Black people are in an affluent neighborhood, they don’t belong,” Chiles added.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/stereotypes-harm-black-lives-and-livelihoods-but-research-suggests-ways-to-improve-things/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historical tropes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are never far from the surface, though, that paint unidentified Black people as a menacing threat. The woman in New York City’s Central Park who called 911 about a bird-watcher in 2020 made a point that</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/nyregion/amy-cooper-false-report-charge.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an “African-American man” was threatening her</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Christian Cooper’s video told a different story, and he had asked the woman to leash her dog in a section where it was required.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People of all colors usually have a right of being exactly where they are. Let’s cease the vengeful tattling.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The longtime spokesman for Loudoun County Public Schools, among the officials excoriated by the </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/28/sexual-assault-schools-virginia-governor-race-517481" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">governor </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the attorney general after a student was charged in two sexual assaults at separate schools, was </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/06/22/loudoun-schools-byard-acquittal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquitted recently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a felony perjury charge. Wayde Byard, accused of lying to a special grand jury investigating the botched handling of the 2021 crimes and their aftermath, was found not guilty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The circuit court jury</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/06/22/loudoun-schools-byard-acquittal/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">deliberated less than two hours</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You won’t see many juries debate felony cases in less time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was relieved,” Byard told me by email regarding the ruling. “I really can’t say I was happy after six months of emotional limbo.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No kidding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byard had been on administrative leave without pay. The division just gave him nearly $89,000 in back pay, a county schools official told me. Byard told me Thursday he’s back at work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer Leffler, Byard’s attorney, said he was a scapegoat and under fire, she told me, because the sexual assaults “brought negative attention to the school system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The least Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares should do is apologize to Byard. They haven’t, and they probably won’t – even though they’ve lambasted Loudoun County schools officials over these horrible crimes. (The former superintendent, who the school board fired, still faces criminal charges related to the assaults.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s spokesperson didn’t respond to my request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victoria LaCivita, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/4ldNEoGoRqM" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spokesperson, said after the verdict: “The Special Grand Jury indicted Mr. Byard after hearing all of the evidence, and we are proud that the Judge agreed with us time and time again that this case needed to be heard in front of a jury. … While we are disappointed with the jury’s decision, we’re proud of our team for uncovering the truth and providing answers to concerned Virginia parents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, she doubled down on the state’s punitive actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Miyares should be ashamed. When top state officials lambaste public servants and drive efforts resulting in criminal charges, they should have the guts to admit publicly when they were wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, Loudoun County Public Schools officials made many mistakes.</span><a href="https://www.loudoun.gov/SpecialGrandJury" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The grand jury’s 92-page report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes them, including this stinging finding: “We believe that throughout this ordeal LCPS administrators were looking out for their own interests instead of the best interests of LCPS.” The report also noted “a breakdown of communication” among several local agencies in handling the cases against the teen attacker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether anyone in the school division deserved to face </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">criminal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> charges, though, was questionable at best. The grand jury issued indictments in</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/12/12/loudoun-school-officials-indicted-by-virginia-special-grand-jury/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">December 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some background here is useful:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Miyares, running in 2021 for their current positions, had castigated school officials repeatedly while saying parents deserved a stronger voice in education. They ginned up a parents’ rights platform all the way to the election,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/03/youngkin-wins-stunning-upset-as-gop-roars-back-in-virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">which both won narrowly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over their Democratic Party opponents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incidents in Loudoun County caused national attention because the male attacker during the first incident in May 2021 was wearing a skirt, though there’s no proof he is transgender. The attack occurred in a girls’ bathroom at Stone Bridge High School. The teen and the girl had had consensual sex in the school bathroom previously, the grand jury noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The politics of the case was obvious, if misdirected. The division was trying to start a policy of allowing </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/29/in-2020-the-legislature-passed-a-transgender-students-rights-law-it-largely-hasnt-been-enforced/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transgender students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use the bathroom matching their gender identity. Opponents seized on the first attack after it became public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assailant, later allowed to attend Broad Run High School while awaiting trial, then groped and strangled a female student in a classroom there in October 2021. He later was convicted in Loudoun County juvenile court in both sexual assaults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The special grand jury stated the second attack should’ve been prevented. “A remarkable lack of curiosity and adherence to operating in silos is ultimately to blame for the October 6 incident,” the report said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, on his first day in office in January 2022, issued several education-related executive orders. Among them: He requested the attorney general to</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-4-Executive-Order-4-on--Loudoun-County-Investigation.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">conduct a full investigation into Loudoun County Public Schools.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Loudoun County School Board and school administrators withheld key details and knowingly lied to parents about the assaults,” the executive order continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two elected state officials have repeatedly used the power of their offices way out of proportion to perceived shortcomings in education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s first executive order ended “critical race theory” in public education, even though K-12 schools don’t teach it in Virginia. The move was a sop to conservatives.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/10/orwellian-snitch-line-shuts-down-will-guv-end-assault-on-teachers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He instituted a short-lived “snitch line” against teachers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was started “for parents to send us any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools,” Youngkin said. Administration officials didn’t confirm the shutdown of the email address until</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/03/youngkin-school-tip-line-emails" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">news media outlets asked about it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, suggesting the line was a dud.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-attorney-general-extends-tj-investigation-to-all-fairfax-county-schools/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares launched a probe in January</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the delayed recognition of National Merit Scholarships in Fairfax County. The school division itself sought</span><a href="https://www.fcps.edu/node/47523" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an independent probe by a law firm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and that investigation found no evidence “to support the claims published in late 2022 suggesting that some FCPS high schools intentionally refrained from notifying Commended Students of their National Merit recognitions, and no evidence that the process or timing for student notifications were impacted in any way by racial considerations or any effort to minimize or fail to celebrate students’ achievements.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to Loudoun County. It’s not unusual for sexual assaults to occur in schools, unfortunately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study released late last year found more than 12,000 incidents on Virginia’s K-12 campuses over a five-year period, the</span><a href="https://investigativereportingworkshop.org/investigation/sexual-harassment-widespread-in-schools/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigative Reporting Workshop found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The allegations included everything from</span><a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/education/sexual-assault-virginia-schools-investigative-reporting-workshop-american-university-loudoun-county/65-57025444-97d1-4580-839a-6864b3d7a11c" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sexual harassment to first-degree rape</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will the current state administration tackle the widespread problem? Or will it raise its voice only for political purposes in a handful of incidents?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, it’s been only the latter.</span></p>

(Bruce DePuyt/ Maryland Matters)
</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something bizarre must happen to some folks when they get behind the wheel, cruise onto the interstate and encounter other motorists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least that’s how one man, arrested after a shooting in March on Interstate 64, explained it to the Virginia State Police. It’s the first time the suspect has faced violent criminal charges, according to his comments and an online search of court records.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much gunfire in Hampton Roads has occurred recently that Capt. Timothy Reibel, a division commander in the state police’s Chesapeake field office, felt compelled to publicize the 18 freeway shootings that happened between Jan. 1 and June 7 in his area. The attacks injured six people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uptick in shootings is an indicator of the mayhem that too often accompanies motorists on highways in Virginia. It was understandable – if regrettable – during the pandemic, when nerves, fear and frustration were at a breaking point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact many shootings still take place, as we strive for a return to normalcy, shows the disturbing trend hasn’t fully abated. That threat frightens motorists and challenges state troopers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of incidents in Hampton Roads is on pace to exceed the 35 reported freeway shootings in 2022 in the sprawling division. Seven shootings have occurred this year in Hampton alone, the city with the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reibel – who is part of a state police division that covers a huge territory including New Kent County to the north, Brunswick County to the west and the Eastern Shore – said there’s no indication that most interstate shootings have been random. Several cases involved suspects and victims who knew each other. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/14/road-rage-and-highway-shootings-are-on-the-rise-but-why/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a similar spate of freeway shootings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> took place last year, I wrote about the pandemic’s effect on road rage and other lawbreaking on highways in Virginia and nationwide. I mentioned then that authorities blamed road rage in the shooting death of a</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/alleged-killers-of-6-year-old-orange-shooting-victim-in-court/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">6-year-old boy in California in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/murder-suspect-alleged-road-rage-shooting-denied-bail/story?id=78362166" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Aiden Leos’ mom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had raised a middle finger to a car that cut her off. Someone in the car fired, killing the boy. A man and woman have since been charged in the slaying. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OG0dTxJu4W"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/14/road-rage-and-highway-shootings-are-on-the-rise-but-why/">Road rage and highway shootings are on the rise. But why?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Road rage and highway shootings are on the rise. But why?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/14/road-rage-and-highway-shootings-are-on-the-rise-but-why/embed/#?secret=kaiJdWBti0#?secret=OG0dTxJu4W" data-secret="OG0dTxJu4W" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roadway gun violence is truly a longstanding problem, especially in Hampton Roads. An</span><a href="https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/VA-Pilot/issues/1994/vp940818/08180581.htm" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">August 1994 news story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted 19 of 36 shootings reported so far that year on Virginia highways had happened in Hampton Roads. The region I live in has too many trigger-happy folks on the freeways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the pandemic’s effects can’t be ignored, either. Isolation, anxiety and our short fuses have played a role in the craziness on the highways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://stateline.org/2021/07/13/cops-scramble-to-deal-with-deadly-road-rage-during-pandemic/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">stateline.org report in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentioned the problems around the United States after the pandemic began. Police said road-rage incidents spiked as people became more stressed and tensions flared more quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we emerge from the worst of COVID-19, we need to take a collective breath and resist the urge to tailgate, flip off passing motorists or take every perceived slight as an excuse to rumble at 65 mph.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifty-one freeway shootings occurred statewide in 2020, 71 in 2021 and 55 last year, said Corinne Geller, a state police spokeswoman. Most cases remain without arrests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With every shooting, we always appeal to the public,” Reibel told me during an interview last week about the Hampton Roads cases. The recent spate made the situation more urgent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shooting I referred to in Chesapeake earlier is a case in point. No one was hurt, but it could’ve easily turned out worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unnamed victim, according to a criminal complaint filed in Chesapeake General District Court, told officials an SUV pulled alongside on eastbound I-64 during a road rage incident. The paperwork doesn’t specify what caused the confrontation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man in the SUV rolled down his passenger-side window and fired at least two shots, the victim said, near Exit 296A. Officials later recovered a bullet from the victim’s vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A separate witness photographed the SUV and gave the images to police. Troopers linked the vehicle to Duane A. Brown, 51, of Portsmouth, who the complaint says admitted being in a confrontation but denied shooting at anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown told officials, though, they’d find a firearm in his vehicle. He had no prior arrests and said he had “never been handcuffed,” according to the complaint; he said that the incident was uncommon for him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown now faces two felony counts. A preliminary exam is scheduled on July 20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another shooting occurred in March on I-664 in Chesapeake. The criminal complaint describes a driver in a Lexus tailgating another vehicle and then racing in front of it and hitting the brakes. The victim told police as the Lexus left the interstate, two shots were fired. The victim continued driving to work, where he found bullet holes on his vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State police eventually identified Eltron Mizell of Suffolk as the suspected shooter. The 24-year-old man confessed to police he was involved in a road-rage incident and shot at the other vehicle, court records show. He faces a felony charge in the shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reibel reiterated, perhaps to calm fears, that no single person is behind the uptick in shootings. It is a public problem that will take our collective efforts to solve. </span></p>

		<p style="font-size:13px"><b>– Capt. Timothy Reibel, a division commander in the state police’s Chesapeake field office, on preventing freeway shootings</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also advised motorists on how to de-escalate incidents on the road with other cars: Back off. Get in another lane. “Don’t do anything to further incite an individual,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In these freeway shootings, rarely are there fixed locations, Reibel said.Witnesses are hard to find and the duration of the incidents is quick. In some cases, victims won’t cooperate – suggesting they want to settle the score themselves. All of this makes it hard to arrest suspects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need people to come forward,” the captain told me. “We need people to talk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s true whenever crime occurs and doubly so in freeway shootings. Killings rarely happen, but injuries often do. They’re all preventable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t engage. Keep calm. Drive away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay alive.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interview that asked whether a job candidate, a general registrar, was still</span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/06/01/lynchburg-electoral-board-ousts-registrar-in-what-democrats-say-is-political-move/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“seeking counseling for PTSD.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Unsubstantiated and unhinged allegations of wrongdoing</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/buckingham-county-virginia-election-staff-quits-baseless-voter-fraud-rcna76435" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">against a county’s top voter registration official and  staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Dozens of</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/13/voting-officials-resignation-amid-outlandish-accusations-an-ominous-sign-for-democracy/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">threatening phone calls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the voter registrar’s staff in another locality. All of that’s happening in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I’d expanded the incidents targeting elections officials</span><a href="https://www.commoncause.org/press-release/virginia-election-resignations/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to the whole country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the list would’ve been even worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The verbal attacks and threats directed at nonpartisan elections administrators must cease if we want to maintain a legitimate democracy. Voting officials ensure the franchise runs smoothly, accurately and fairly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t deserve the vitriol and threats of violence hurled their way that have increased since Donald Trump’s “Big Lie” after the 2020 election. Many GOP politicians, despite the overwhelming evidence debunking the former president, have followed his lead – and so have some of their constituents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s just absolute hatred, false accusations and absolute disrespect,” Dianna Moorman, general registrar in James City County, told me last week.</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/13/voting-officials-resignation-amid-outlandish-accusations-an-ominous-sign-for-democracy/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As I reported previously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, her office has received at least 29 intimidating phone calls since the start of the year, and her home address was doxxed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand people are fed up with the way the country is going,” Moorman continued. “But the extreme disrespect and disdain are being directed at the wrong people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moorman said her board unanimously reappointed her. But my colleague</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/05/after-buckingham-more-virginia-registrars-find-themselves-on-chopping-block/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Graham Moomaw’s story last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted several registrars around Virginia, facing the end of their four-year term June 30, are on the chopping block. That’s unusual, and political overtones often have accompanied the removals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s the norm to be reappointed,” said Brenda Cabrera, president of the</span><a href="https://www.varegistrars.org/home" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Voter Registrars Association of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the general registrar in the city of Fairfax. New terms are especially common when registrars have done their jobs effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“General registrars know themselves to be the nonpartisan administrators in the room,” she added. “This feels like a politicization of something that normally hasn’t been politicized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some three-member electoral boards, who select the general registrars, seem determined to oust longtime administrators they can’t keep under their thumbs. (The boards have two members from the current governor’s party and one from the minority party, so there’s been turnover since Republican Glenn Youngkin took office last year.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creeping politicization is occurring even though, as Attorney General Jason Miyares noted in a</span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2023/23-023-Byron-issued.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">May 15 advisory opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, board members cannot refuse to reappoint a registrar solely for political reasons. They’re not required to keep someone in the role, but as Miyares said: “[A] general registrar who can prove that an electoral board reappointment decision was due to political reasons can obtain reinstatement and money damages.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be surprised if ousted voting officials seek redress in court – and win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General registrars have resigned under pressure, been removed or could be replaced in Buckingham, Nottoway and Pittsylvania counties and Lynchburg city. Another registrar declined to talk to me in depth, fearing her decade-old-plus job wouldn’t be renewed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynchburg’s board earlier this month voted to replace general registrar Christine Gibbons with a technology manager. </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/06/02/amid-controversy-lynchburg-electoral-board-hires-a-new-registrar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardinal News reported Gibbons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had received good annual reviews since beginning her term in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2020, Cardinal News reported, a sign was placed on her lawn reading: “Christine Gibbons Belongs In Jail. Lock Her Up.” No charges were filed, but Gibbons said she believed it was retaliation for her handling of absentee ballots. A board member had asked Gibbons during an interview May 12 if she was seeking counseling related to the incident, a move that violates the Americans with Disabilities Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelly Keesee has been the general registrar and director of elections for eight years in Pittsylvania County. She told me the board didn’t reappoint her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Going through a turbulent end of term makes you do a deep reflection on where you stand on election administration,” Keesee said. Officials often face adversity as election administrators, “but I don’t know that I’ve experienced it to this magnitude,” she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities handle elections, but state bigwigs could use the bully pulpit to squelch these outlandish attacks against nonpartisan voting officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I sought out comment from Miyares about the attacks and how his so-called “election integrity unit” may be contributing to them, spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita replied:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Election Integrity Unit serves as a resource to the local registrars should they need assistance or legal advice. Attorney General Miyares condemns any and all forms of political violence and intimidation, and is grateful for the individuals that work towards preserving the American Miracle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sentiment is obviously welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that the unit was created, however,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/miyares-integrity-unit-is-sop-to-election-deniers/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was a sop to election deniers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as I wrote previously. Earlier state audits</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/03/31/audit-overwhelmingly-confirms-virginias-election-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> verified President Joe Biden’s comfortable win</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the commonwealth in 2020 and the results of the 2021 election, in which Miyares and other Republicans won. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coupled with Virginia’s politically motivated decision last month</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/18/quitting-multistate-voter-data-program-plays-into-conspiracy-theorists-hands/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to leave a multistate voter-data program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the attacks on local registrars are new warning shots. These moves chip away at the wall of democracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That wall will hold only if Virginians and elected officials fight to keep it standing.</span></p>

So it was no surprise that, as The Washington Post reported,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/05/16/black-communities-excess-deaths/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">African American communities suffered an excess 1.6 million deaths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared with white populations over the past two decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What shocked me, though, were these lines in the article: “The shorter life expectancy of Black Americans means they do not derive what they have invested in Social Security. People born in 1960 can start receiving their full Social Security benefits at age 67, but </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2018/004.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Black men born that year had an average life expectancy of just 61 years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those facts are extremely personal to me:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was born in 1959. I began earning a regular paycheck – and thus contributing to the payroll tax – at 16 (thank you, Burger King).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither my father nor my two older brothers lived past 70. Yet my maternal grandfather, a farmer from Prince Edward County, reached 102 and was physically mobile and mentally sharp throughout his life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discerning how long I’ll live is a crapshoot. Life expectancy in Virginia decreased during COVID-19, and the pandemic “exacerbated long standing health disparities,” </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/110/2022/05/EPI-Report-Life-Expectancy-in-VA-5-4-22.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the state’s Department of Health. Regarding Social Security, though, I may have paid into a system the odds suggest I won’t fully benefit from, to paraphrase The Post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve declined to take program benefits so far because of investments and savings I share with The Boss, my no-nonsense, shrewd spouse. The longer I delay, the more I can earn at my full retirement age, just shy of 67. I’d earn even more if I hold off ‘til  age 70.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The differences are substantial. If I began taking cash today, I’d be getting just 79% of the amount at full retirement and 63% of the monthly benefits at 70.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s one way to look at it. The other is a debate Michelle Singletary, the decades-long personal finance columnist at The Washington Post, and her husband waged among themselves –</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2018/01/08/early-or-late-one-senior-says-ignore-the-conventional-wisdom-of-waiting-to-take-social-security-take-it-at-62/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and in the newspaper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He wanted to take Social Security benefits at age 62 because it would take many years to make up for the cash lost from delaying until age 70.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since The Boss is 60, if I die before collecting she “could be eligible for a surviving spouse benefit,” Shawn Fordham, a spokesman for the agency, told me. Other categories of family survivors who could get the money that individuals earn</span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10008.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are on the Social Security website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some folks, though, might face circumstances</span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/onyourown.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">limiting the amount of cash to survivors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or maybe they have no close relatives who would qualify. “If there are none, those funds remain a part of the trust fund to pay current beneficiaries,” Fordham noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conversation about when to cash out is crucial, especially for African American men and families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better to get 79% of something, instead of 100% of nothing.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin, have quaffed the MAGA Kool-Aid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, the sickly-sweet aftertaste will harm Virginians of all political stripes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Beals, a Youngkin appointee as commissioner of the state Department of Elections</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-joins-republican-states-pulling-out-of-multi-state-voter-list-program/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced the commonwealth would leave the compact known as the</span> <a href="https://ericstates.org/about/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic Registration Information Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Virginia will become the latest of several states, controlled by Republican leaders, to leave the program that enhances voter registration and security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The party always wailing about voter fraud –</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/01/truth-about-election-fraud-its-rare/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">even though it’s minuscule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – has been successful in</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/06/1161374479/electronic-registration-information-center-eric-florida-missouri-west-virginia" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">getting states to leave an organization that fights voter fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This destructive campaign makes no sense – unless you want to cast doubt on election results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERIC was a noncontroversial, effective program, and Virginia was a charter member in 2012 under then-Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican. The goals of the nonprofit, nonpartisan organization are two-pronged: Use data from motor vehicles departments, the U.S. Postal Service and other voter registration offices to check for voters who have died or moved out of state. And help states reach out to potentially eligible voters who haven’t registered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no great substitute for ERIC,” John Fortier told me. He’s a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on elections and former director of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Democracy Project.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ERIC had gone about its data-sharing work out of the spotlight – until conspiracy theorists and disingenuous politicians lambasted it. The complaints increased after Trump’s Big Lie following the 2020 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s clear that here in Virginia our Republican leaders are buying into ([Donald]) Trump’s lies, they are buying the Big Lie, they’re running with it, and they’re making policy based on it,” Del. Marcus Simon, D-Falls Church, said at a news conference this week about Beals’ decision.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.votebeat.org/23045551/eric-electronic-registration-information-center-voter-roll-matching-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Votebeat.org story last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> chronicles the unhinged brayings of extremists who add 2 + 2 to come up with 563. They claim ERIC is a Democratic Party plot to win contests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To sum up their reasoning: Critics contend because liberal benefactor George Soros once donated $500,000 to the Pew Charitable Trusts for voting access activities, this must be a left-wing plot. In truth, Votebeat reported, Pew provided startup money to ERIC in 2012 (the nonpartisan research center receives grants of more than $300 million annually) and has given relatively little to ERIC since then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, the program later switched to a member-funded model. It’s just plain false to say Soros, a frequent boogeyman of the right, contributed directly to ERIC or controlled it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals, in a May 11 letter to ERIC’s executive director, contends Virginia is leaving, among other reasons, because of the recent departures of seven other state members, increasing costs and “incomplete participation of Virginia’s bordering states and jurisdictions that compel independent data sharing relationships with non-ERIC members.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The costs, though, are a mere pittance. ERIC’s FY ’22 dues for Virginia were $37,000, and they rose to $54,000 in the current fiscal year, Department of Elections spokeswoman Andrea Gaines told me by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s pocket dust in an operating budget of $42 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are the so-called shortcomings consistent with what Virginia officials in the Youngkin administration said recently about the program. As my colleague</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-joins-republican-states-pulling-out-of-multi-state-voter-list-program/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Graham Moomaw reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Josh Lief in the Attorney General’s Office within the past year called ERIC “a benefit to the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond NPR affiliate VPM News </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-05-15/virginia-voter-registration-law-eric-data-elections" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what elections department staff said last fall: “The data quality from the ERIC program is significantly better than other interstate exchange programs and any program that ELECT (the department’s acronym) could operate in-house with existing resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked Gaines why the department had changed course, she answered: “Commissioner Beals’ consistent position has been that she is carefully examining Virginia’s relationship with ERIC and pushing for needed reforms. She has also publicly stated that ELECT is reviewing all of its data-sharing relationships with state agencies for the purposes of list maintenance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have things fallen off a cliff so dramatically in a year that ERIC is irredeemable?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaines said the elections department will continue several list maintenance steps, including removing dead voters based on information gathered from the state Department of Health. It’s also talking with other states “about creating new state-to-state data-sharing relationships for the purpose of identifying potential double voters.” She declined to say which states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Virginia enters a compact that has </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Republican-led states, why would non-Republican voters trust it? ERIC’s non-partisanship lent it credibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortier, at the American Enterprise Institute, said Democrats tended to like ERIC’s voter outreach, while Republicans favored the voter list maintenance. “ERIC was sort of a compromise,” he told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States that leave it, Fortier said, won’t be able to duplicate the data-gathering and technology ERIC provided anytime soon. “It took time to build,” he noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That fact is important in a place like Virginia, which has elections every year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no stretch to say the department is merely following the tack set by Youngkin, who played coy during his party’s gubernatorial nomination process about whether the 2020 presidential election was won by Joe Biden. Since Youngkin won in 2021,</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3612075-youngkin-traveling-to-five-more-states-amid-talk-of-possible-2024-bid/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">he’s elevated his national profile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by traveling to other states and stumping for GOP candidates,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/05/12/youngkin-voter-rolls-election-deniers-eric/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">including election deniers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican voters demand their candidates repeat the lie that Trump won. Shame on the craven politicos who knuckle under.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why pulling out of ERIC is so harmful. It will make it easier to question election results and assail their accuracy. Winners will continue to be under a microscope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a lousy move that emboldens the delusional and weakens democracy.</span></p>

(Norfolk State University/Flickr)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s difficult to maintain hope that we can reduce gun violence when so many shootings – from the spraying of bullets at</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/alabama-sweet-16-birthday-shooting-50e3dd7d82f2ff9b7ba4f260af94c3a2" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a Sweet Sixteen party</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Alabama, to a senseless execution of</span><a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/national/5-dead-in-texas-execution-style-shooting-suspect-armed-with-ar-15-is-on-the-loose" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">family members in Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to the sentencing in</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/04/28/ronnie-marshall-sentenced-edward-brenda-mcdaniel/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the slayings of a Fairfax County couple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – suggest the opposite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s essential to know the forces of goodwill and sanity have not surrendered. They don’t always garner news coverage, but many community leaders and police officials are fighting relentlessly to protect others, no matter the enormity of the task.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 44,300 people died</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in gun-related incidents last year across the country. More than half were suicides, but homicides were a substantial number.You can see the sober search for solutions in forums like the one I attended a few weeks ago at Norfolk State University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/nsu-hosts-gun-violence-forum/291-70743b67-66b3-41ac-865f-26f0490c6518" target="_blank">“Stop the Shots: Impacts of Gun Violence on Communities of Color”</a> featured discourse among police supervisors, college professors and others. They conceded the ongoing problems but also suggested different strategies to fight back, including strengthening families and confronting the fact that crime suspects are getting younger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s on us” to alter conditions, said Kayla Hicks, CEO and founder of</span><a href="https://www.sustainequity.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustain Equity Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Newport News nonprofit organization dedicated to improving conditions for Black women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hicks, a former official with the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence, urged the 100 people in attendance to support each other </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> police officers. The latter isn’t always a popular sentiment,</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">especially since the killing of George Floyd in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see the efforts to prevent crimes and recidivism in how public money is allocated. U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat, on Tuesday ceremoniously awarded $760,000 in</span><a href="https://bobbyscott.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/scott-votes-appropriations-funding-package" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">federal funding to the city of Newport News for programs to reduce gun violence and other crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money, appropriated by Congress last year, includes help for prisoner re-entry programs and aid for victims and witnesses of crime. Congress awarded $4.6 million to a similar program in Hampton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking about prevention, Scott noted: “Efforts will be made to make sure people coming out of prison can get on the right track and stay on the right track. It costs a little money, but it’s worth it,”</span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/local-news/newport-news/congressman-bobby-scott-to-deliver-760k-for-gun-violence-prevention-in-newport-news/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">WAVY 10</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about Antipas Harris last year, when he organized a</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/06/symphony-of-consolation-will-counter-violence/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Symphony Orchestra concert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to comfort the families of gun violence victims. Harris recently asked Del. Angelia Williams Graves, D-Norfolk, to submit a</span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/HB1400/Introduced/MR/408/12h/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$800,000 request in the state budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support a hospital-based violence intervention program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris envisioned his group, the</span><a href="https://theurcnorfolk.com/about-us-urc" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Urban Renewal Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, partnering with Sentara Norfolk General Hospital to expand Sentara’s current program that helps people traumatized by violence. Harris said hospital officials note many people killed in gun violence had been shot previously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graves said Harris has put in the work to assist Hampton Roads, and those efforts made it easy for her to shepherd the request. “He’s done a lot of different things in the community,” Graves said. The money is currently stuck in General Assembly budget negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some efforts fail, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake,</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2273" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sponsored legislation this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to start a 72-hour waiting period before buying firearms. Hayes told me a relative of a victim killed in the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/30/guns-not-mental-illness-at-heart-of-americas-terror/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake Walmart shootings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last fall – when a manager there killed six colleagues and wounded others before taking his own life – suggested such a measure might have prevented those mass slayings. Authorities said the manager-turned-mass shooter Andre Bing legally bought the handgun</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/25/walmart-shooting-handgun-purchased-same-day" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the same day as the Nov. 22 attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence supports waiting periods because they can</span><a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/gun-sales/waiting-periods/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“cool off” impulsive acts of homicides and suicides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It cites a 2019 study showing 85% of non-gun owners and 72% of gun owners support mandatory waiting periods for firearm purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayes’ bill, though, died in a House subcommittee this session. Republicans, who tend to be pro-gun rights, hold the majority in the state House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn’t make any sense,” Hayes lamented. “We can’t go to the ballpark without a threat, can’t go to the store without a threat, can’t go to a prayer meeting at church without a threat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you browse through news reports around Virginia, it’s depressingly easy to uncover examples of gun violence.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/04/28/ronnie-marshall-sentenced-edward-brenda-mcdaniel/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported last week on the sentencing of Ronnie Marshall, 22, in the 2021 murders of a husband and wife in front of their Fairfax County home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prosecutors said Marshall was looking for the son of Edward and Brenda McDaniel, thinking the younger McDaniel was part of a group that had taken a gun from him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slain husband and wife were both medical professionals and had served in the Army. They’re gone, and Marshall will now serve a life sentence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the NSU gun violence forum, one attendee’s comments were especially striking. “The elephant in the room,” he said, “is we are devaluing one another.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s at the heart of a lot of carnage. It’s been the case for decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guns are a part of the madness. But so too is the overwhelming willingness to use them, no matter how trivial the perceived grievance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activists – really, all of us – must attack on both fronts: We have too many guns. And collectively, we have no hesitation about using them.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two primary ways to win elections:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can encourage citizens to turn out en masse for your party’s candidate. Or you can install barriers for people who want to choose the other side’s nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleta Mitchell, a top Republican Party operative, just proved again her side is much too dependent on the latter. Nor is the GOP’s rationale for erecting hurdles to voting, including here in Virginia, based on facts.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell is a longtime GOP lawyer and fundraiser who worked with Donald Trump to attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. This month, she used a presentation to Republican donors to urge limits on voting at college campuses, same-day voter registration and automatic mailing of ballots to voters,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/20/cleta-mitchell-voting-college-students/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Level Playing Field for 2024,” Mitchell’s presentation, had more than 50 slides and was designed to reduce voter access and turnout among certain groups,</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/15/1136563709/young-voters-helped-democrats-win-the-senate-and-other-midterm-elections" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">including students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and people who vote by mail. Both groups tend to skew toward Democrats.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That tells you a lot about Mitchell’s motivation and that of Republican leaders.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell said the nation’s electoral systems, according to The Post, must be saved “for any candidate other than a leftist to have a chance to WIN in 2024.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s risible, given the</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-States-Presidential-Election-Results-1788863" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican presidential nominee has won the popular vote just once</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this century. Voting systems aren’t the problem for GOP candidates; it’s what they’re selling.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one example, U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and fellow Republican members of Congress  this week</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/04/26/house-gop-debt-limit-debate/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">threatened huge budget cuts through a bill to raise the debt ceiling.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The crisis could upend the U.S. economy; the gambit is insane. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Post wasn’t at the voter presentation in Nashville, but it was given a copy of the slides. It also listened to audio of the event obtained by a liberal journalist.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I sent email and Facebook messages to Mitchell through her organization,</span><a href="https://whoscounting.us/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Election Integrity Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but got no response. (Among my questions, I’d asked for the PowerPoint presentation and whether Mitchell had ever voted by mail.) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell told the Tennessee gathering she’s optimistic the Virginia Senate will flip to the GOP this fall and then eliminate early voting. She complained about the state’s current 45-day early voting period as being too long. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That stance puzzled Deb Wake, president of the nonpartisan League of Women Voters of Virginia. She said the 45-day total is reasonable.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s when the ballots go out to military voters and overseas voters,” Wake told me in an interview.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/13/voting-officials-resignation-amid-outlandish-accusations-an-ominous-sign-for-democracy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor is there runaway voter fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the commonwealth, as Mitchell and others have suggested. “There are lots of claims, but no support” to back them up, Wake added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, as The Post noted, experts say voter fraud doesn’t happen often. When it does, the numbers are usually minuscule given the size of the overall electorate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding another of Mitchell’s claims, same-day voter registration is not an anomaly around the country. The</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-voter-registration" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Conference of State Legislatures notes Washington, D.C., and 22 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – including Virginia – use it. Nearly all of those states allow people to register and vote on Election Day.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NCSL also noted common security measures, such as proof of identity and assessing criminal penalties for fraudulent voting, help keep the totals legitimate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia passed legislation in 2020 allowing same-day voting, and the practice became effective last year.</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/maintenance-reports/2022-Post-Election-Report_FINAL.3.3.2022.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2022 election report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, released by the Virginia Department of Elections last month, noted some hiccups the first time it was used. That’s to be expected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While challenges existed,” the report said, “it is important to note that some general registrars did express positive observations regarding same-day registration or, at least, some optimism about the ability to administer same-day registration in the future.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what’s really going on here with Mitchell’s bombast? Chalk it up to a nation undergoing changing demographics, and a Republican Party that depends on huge numbers of white voters but does poorly with other racial groups.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of devoting more time to broadening its base and re-examining its platform, the GOP has raised phantom claims of illegal voting and denied that Democrats won close contests – often putting democracy at risk.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Trump formed</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_fd507b72-a4d1-571a-b752-935f86dd13c4.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a bogus commission to study reputed fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, falsely claiming without proof that as many 5 million undocumented immigrants voted in 2016. It wasn’t enough that he won the Electoral College; his fragile feelings were hurt that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a few million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump shut the panel down in early 2018 after it met just twice and after states opposed voter data requests.</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_5290afe6-f987-52dd-8bbb-4f4baf6953f7.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">As I wrote back then about the panel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Civil rights groups had railed against the true intent, too – calling the commission a vehicle to suppress voting.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s repeated lies in 2020 helped stoke the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. During the midterm elections in 2022, the Republican Party didn’t experience the red wave that pundits had predicted beforehand.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not surprised by Mitchell’s current tack. It’s part of a pattern in which straightforward facts are discounted, and partisan anecdotes – often of questionable veracity – are extrapolated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I met Mitchell in 2013, when she participated in a forum at the College of William &amp; Mary</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_13d1144d-e956-51e6-bcc8-e9e411fb8c41.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">about long lines and other obstacles during presidential elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She questioned whether a presidential commission set up then was right to study those problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and others showed otherwise. In fact, wait times in 2012 at some polling places around Virginia reached four hours.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems do exist for voters, but not the ones Mitchell is hammering. Her motivation is to keep left-leaning people from the polls.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s yet another assault on democracy, by a party desperate to find enough support in some contests. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buckingham County’s elections director and her entire staff had had enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enough of the lies about voting fraud. Enough of the accusations of wrongdoing and treason by county residents. Enough of the demented denialism stemming from the 2020 presidential election, in which too many people believed the bogus conspiracy claims of Donald Trump. The</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-fact-checker-tracked-trump-claims/2021/01/23/ad04b69a-5c1d-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">serial prevaricator’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> falsehoods  numbered in the tens of thousands while in office.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsey Taylor felt she just “couldn’t take it anymore” and recently quit the job she’d held since 2019,</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/buckingham-county-virginia-election-staff-quits-baseless-voter-fraud-rcna76435" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">NBC News reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Two part-time staffers also quit, following a deputy registrar who had departed in February. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mind you, all of this occurred in a conservative county where Trump won in 2020 with 56% of the vote.</span> <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:2020/year_to:2020/office_id:1/stage:General" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(He lost by 10 percentage points in Virginia to Joe Biden)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2022, Republican incumbent Rep. Bob Good – who also rejected the 2020 presidential results – won Buckingham County by nearly 30 percentage points.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some conspiracy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Registrars all across the country report threats in letters, emails, voicemails and phone calls. Some find their personal addresses and information posted on-line,” John McGlennon, a longtime government professor at the College of William &amp; Mary, told me. “Job security, attorney fees and the prospect of legal charges without any evidence of wrongdoing simply make the job of registrar (or employee of the registrar or election day worker) too hard.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The absurdities emanating from Buckingham County, in which a professional administrator felt hounded from her job</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/buckingham-county-virginia-election-staff-quits-baseless-voter-fraud-rcna76435" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by the Republican-majority electoral board and local Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are more proof of the threats to democracy nationwide that have expanded significantly since the 2020 election. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will we obey the rule of law, or capitulate to the unhinged braying of the mob? Do we look for facts, or do we accept baseless claims that only support our side? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to identify events around the county where the will of the people has been overruled, customs and norms have been abolished for political gain, or a majority party has choked off legitimate debate.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Senate Republicans denied then-President Barack Obama a chance to replace the</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/29/624467256/what-happened-with-merrick-garland-in-2016-and-why-it-matters-now" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">late Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in early 2016, yet they rushed to confirm a new justice when</span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/biographyginsburg.aspx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruth Bader Ginsburg died six weeks before the 2020 election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several GOP-led states last month exited the</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/06/1161374479/electronic-registration-information-center-eric-florida-missouri-west-virginia" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Electronic Registration Information Center,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which experts considered a reliable way for states to share voter registration data. NPR cited a “</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/09/1076529761/right-wing-conspiracies-have-a-new-target-a-tool-that-fights-actual-voter-fraud" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustained misinformation campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the far-right” that contributed to the pullout.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, politicians who have unduly worried about voter fraud have, in effect, discarded one resource to help prevent it. (Virginia remains a member of ERIC.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Florida’s Republican-controlled Legislature</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/us/virginia-youngkin-voting-former-felons.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">basically rejected a citizens’ ballot initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> granting voting rights to possibly more than 900,000 former felons.</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-rights-restoration-efforts-florida" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 65% of Floridians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had approved the 2018 ballot measure.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attacks on election officials are particularly troubling. They could usher in a tainted system where party hacks – not neutral administrators – oversee voting. That’s noteworthy here in Virginia, where elections occur every year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Efforts by election deniers to intimidate election workers and interfere with free and fair elections are not only illegal, they are a serious threat to our democracy,” Michelle Kanter Cohen, policy director and senior counsel at the nonpartisan</span><a href="https://www.fairelectionscenter.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair Elections Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said through a spokesperson. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-local-election-officials-finds-safety-fears-colleagues-and" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2022 poll by the Brennan Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted one in six election officials have experienced threats because of their job, and 77% say that they feel these threats have increased in recent years. “More than one in four are concerned about being assaulted on the job,” the poll said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dianna Moorman, director of elections in James City County, relayed a disturbing incident in her office during early voting in October. She said a man, who didn’t live in the county, spurred a dispute over First Amendment rights and what words or signage he could display at a voting precinct. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man later aired a YouTube video of the incident that, Moorman said, was edited misleadingly. She’s gotten up to 29 intimidating or threatening phone calls since January. “They have provided my home address and doxxed my entire family,” she told me Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moorman has been an election official for 18 years in the county and the chief of her office since 2016. After the October incident and the YouTube posting, she’s had to increase security at her home and at the general registrar’s office.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not what Moorman expected the position would entail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are sworn to uphold the constitution of Virginia,” she noted. “Our job is to ensure fair, safe and transparent elections, all while being apolitical.”  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me be clear: One party, the GOP, is more guilty of hurling wild accusations with no support and of suggesting misdeeds not backed by proof.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal: Muck up the legitimacy of elections, frighten voting officials who are trying to be fair and cast doubt on the other side’s victories.. Similar resignations – some explained, some not – have occurred in</span><a href="https://www.mtpr.org/montana-news/2023-03-31/lincoln-countys-election-officials-resign-raising-questions-about-upcoming-elections?cs-from=94a2e102-7fa8-499e-b2d6-f100df0fd96c" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Montana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://arizona.votebeat.org/2023/1/25/23571731/cochise-county-lisa-marra-resignation-election-security?cs-from=94a2e102-7fa8-499e-b2d6-f100df0fd96c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.commoncause.org/texas/press-release/gillespie-county-elections-staff-resign-over-death-threats-stalking/?cs-from=94a2e102-7fa8-499e-b2d6-f100df0fd96c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGlennon, the William &amp; Mary professor, started at the Williamsburg university in 1974, the same year Richard Nixon resigned during the Watergate scandal. The professor said the political climate in the country has hardened over the past half century.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should all be worried. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The level of polarization is so high, and the tendency to not view your political adversaries as … legitimate citizens with a point of view, and instead as mortal enemies, is strong,” McGlennon said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed. Democracy isn’t at a precipice yet, but it’s moving ever closer.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buckingham County is one example of that ominous slide.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the madness constituting the discourse about public schools in Virginia nowadays.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trial balloon floated by Superintendent Mark Taylor came the same week the Spotsylvania division removed 14 books from library shelves. Similar debates</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/education/23-va-school-districts-have-taken-books-off-shelves-in-past-two-years/article_7ce0f31d-dbab-55f0-9576-cb4ae93e14eb.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">over book bans have taken place elsewhere in the commonwealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in recent years.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several of those titles focus on African-Americans and other persons of color, the LGBTQ community, sexuality, teen prostitution and other serious issues adolescents might face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much for learning about folks unlike yourself or gaining an understanding about the struggles other people encounter.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debate over  libraries’ existence in the nearly 24,000-student division is particularly crucial. Yes, smartphones are a source of tons of information –  both credible and not  –  right in our hands.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Libraries, though, support literacy and help enhance the school curriculum. They might provide the only broadband access some students have, too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the</span><a href="https://www.ala.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">American Library Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Office for Intellectual Freedom, told me school librarians teach about misinformation as well as how to find accurate, legitimate sources of information and data.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“School libraries are essential for better educational outcomes for young people,” Caldwell-Stone said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Association of School Librarians, affiliated with ALA, said</span><a href="https://www.vaasl.org/assets/Advocacy/Letter%20of%20support%20Spotsylvania%20librarians%20March%2030%2C%202023.docx%20%281%29.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that state code</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title8/agency20/chapter131/section190/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">requires specific library services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in public schools and quoted that law in part: “Each school shall maintain an organized library media center as the resource center of the school and provide a unified program of media services and activities for students and teachers before, during, and after school.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state association added: “Multiple educational research studies have proven the educational effectiveness of having a certified librarian on staff and the effect a certified librarian has on student learning and literacy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state code might make the subject moot, though the Spotsylvania schools chief used the specter of closures to try to loosen cash from officials who control the division’s purse strings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for Taylor told me by email: “The superintendent does </span><b>NOT </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">wish to close libraries.” (Emphasis hers.) So why did he use this gambit for funding purposes? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement from Taylor after a recent meeting about the upcoming budget, he said: “I dislike every one of those cuts and do not want to make any of them. I did this to illustrate a point.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the Board of Supervisors fails to appropriate $19 million in new local revenue to our division and/or if the state fails to fix the $5.25 million shortfall in their projection for the FY ’24 fund, then we will be facing some very hard decisions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some illustration.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the county’s public image regarding K-12 schools in recent years, closing libraries was the wrong beachhead. Here’s a brief synopsis: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotsylvania’s the place School Board members Rabih Abuismail and Kirk Twigg, in 2021, favored</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/education/vp-nw-removing-books-spotsylvania-schools-20211116-zklrbxdfwfh2bgs4mlaaebd3pe-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">burning books they deemed  too sexually explicit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positions like theirs make you wonder whether they even know history. Book burning is notoriously linked to Nazi Germany, especially during a 1933 incident in which university students torched</span><a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/book-burning" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 25,000 volumes of so-called “un-German” books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was one of several precursors to World War II and the extermination of 6 million Jews.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communist China burned books</span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/brief-history-book-burning-printing-press-internet-archives-180964697/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">under Mao during the Cultural Revolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what those board members hoped to rekindle? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some books recently ordered off the shelves in Spotsylvania have been the source of controversy in other districts around the country. A vocal, conservative minority of parents usually has agitated to remove them, often claiming several passages were too sexually graphic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has occurred even when panels of reviewers had already determined the benefits of keeping the tomes in libraries and as part of school curriculums. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parent in Spotsylvania had complained about the books. </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/14-books-being-removed-from-spotsylvania-school-libraries/3317248/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Kent,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who helped review two of the books, told Washington D.C.&#8217;s NBC 4 the division’s ruling “seems to be an abuse of the system.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve had 70-plus parents and educators that make a decision, and the decision of one person can overrule all of them,” Kent added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This turns the notion of “the majority rules” on its head. It means a few parents can force </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">their </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">viewpoints on everybody else.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shuttering libraries, though, might be even worse, especially for low-income and rural students who may lack the same access and money as other families.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s troubling,” Lisa Varga, executive director of the Virginia Library Association, told me. “I just really support our school librarians and everything they’ve gone through.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all should. They’re the ones guiding young people. They’re the ones broadening minds and helping sift fact from fiction. They’re the ones students depend on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not extraneous. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forget, for a moment, that Gov. Glenn Youngkin has toughened the requirements for felons to regain voting and other civil rights upon release. It’s a punitive policy</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_23caa5bd-c765-5102-8a6f-80c6bb6aca1e.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">born in racism during the 1901-02 constitutional convention.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forget, too, the Republican administration</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/03/22/youngkin-virginia-felon-rights-restoration/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">didn’t inform Virginians en masse about the changes until Democratic legislators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> began fielding concerns from constituents. Or that released felons have said repeatedly how regaining those rights makes them better citizens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a huge deal,” Shawn Weneta, policy and advocacy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, told me this week.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m struck, instead, by the rank hypocrisy of Youngkin’s move compared to his stance on parental rights in education. The political novice used the latter to propel him to elective office.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin signed</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Inauguration Day – hewing to a vocal minority of Virginians riled up by</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/28/why-the-furor-over-critical-race-theory-misses-the-point/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">disingenuous conservatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – that parents “are empowered with open access to information on primary instructional materials utilized in any school.” In an op-ed last year,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/25/glenn-youngkin-virginias-parents-can-decide-whats-best-their-children/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">he wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Virginia’s laws reinforce parents’ fundamental rights to make decisions with regards to their child’s upbringing and care.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to restoration of rights, though, Youngkin was noticeably mute when the General Assembly had a chance to amend the state Constitution and allow all registered voters a chance to weigh in by referendum.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay with me here. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Assembly, when Democrats controlled both chambers in 2021, passed a bill on restoration of rights for felons. (Those rights include becoming a notary public and running for elective office.) The amendment was the first prong in a multi-step process. To be successful,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/03/republicans-fall-in-line-against-final-push-to-expand-felon-voting-rights-in-virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it needs to pass a second time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then Virginia voters need to approve it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans gained control of the state House in 2022, the same year Youngkin became governor.</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/03/republicans-fall-in-line-against-final-push-to-expand-felon-voting-rights-in-virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">They killed the bill in a subcommittee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that session, though several Republicans had signed on as sponsors.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, who’s issued no shortage of executive orders and has made public pronouncements on a variety of topics, kept his mouth shut on this particular debate. So much for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">vox populi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state constitution vests restoration rights in the governor. Several chief executives, starting with Republican Bob McDonnell,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/03/22/youngkin-virginia-felon-rights-restoration/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically returned citizenship rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for at least some former prisoners after their sentences ended.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic governors who followed made the process easier. Ralph Northam ended the requirement that felons had to complete parole before regaining their rights.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans probably fear ditching the gubernatorial prerogative would bring more African-Americans to the polls. The racial group overwhelmingly supports Democrats in national and state elections.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a lousy reason, however, for denying rights to any voting bloc, and it recalls the racist delegates at the constitutional convention in the early 20th century who blocked Black people from the polls. Other disenfranchisement tools included now-defunct literacy tests and poll taxes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU says only Virginia and Kentucky permanently keep convicted felons from the polls. That&#8217;s not a distinction to be proud of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kay Coles James, secretary of the commonwealth, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/032323.Letter-to-Spruill-on-ROR-2-1.pdf" target="_blank">said in a letter</a> that “that every applicant [should] be considered individually as required by the Constitution and underscored by the Supreme Court of Virginia in 2016.” That’s fine,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_23caa5bd-c765-5102-8a6f-80c6bb6aca1e.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">except a procedural issue that year under then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was resolved, and there’s been no significant legal challenge to gubernatorial restorations since then. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This administration hasn’t even been transparent about what’s changed.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s incredibly important for the administration to be very clear about how to apply, but also what criteria is being used,” said Rebecca Green,associate professor at the College of William and Mary Law School and co-founder of a program to help felons regain their right to vote.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a new form under the current administration asks applicants whether they’ve been convicted of a violent crime. If the answer is yes, does that lead to more scrutiny?   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gubernatorial spokeswoman declined to answer my question about why Youngkin didn’t urge legislative Republicans to pass the constitutional amendment. You can’t tout a “tough-on-crime posture,” I suppose, unless you’re making it tough for former prisoners to regain basic rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a terrible way, however, to reintegrate people into society.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a University of Pittsburgh assistant professor</span><a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/web.sas.upenn.edu/dist/7/538/files/2019/07/Shineman_RestoringRightsRestoringTrust_ESRA2019.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote in one study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Results suggest that reversing disenfranchisement causes newly enfranchised citizens to increase their pro-democratic attitudes and behaviors – all of which are predictors of reduced crime and recidivism.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My hunch is Republicans don’t want a referendum because many Virginians know people like Shawna Lawson. She regained her rights following robbery convictions in the late 1990s. Lawson now runs a </span><a href="https://casadesuenos-houseofdreams.business.site/?fbclid=IwAR36zk5RVnt-NgXw8MyDiDB-B1UG4zxXHgcm3UN82iuFE5BFZuF9HhhcqhE#summary" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nonprofit organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based in Newport News that assists people facing prison re-entry, homelessness and mental health issues. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I made a mistake in my youth,” Lawson told me. Voting allows “a say-so in things affecting you and your family. Just because you start in a position doesn’t mean you have to end in that position.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weneta, the ACLU official, served 16 years in prison. He said he’s voted in every primary and general election since he regained his rights.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This really needs to go to the voters,” Weneta said. “Right now, it’s in the hands of a few partisan actors.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means it’s great campaign fodder for anybody seeking a presidential bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It stinks, though, for people who want to become fuller members of society and their communities. Stop using them as political pawns. </span></p>

The firearms might have been right in their own homes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Against this backdrop, lawmakers in the General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/31/most-gun-storage-bills-appear-doomed-in-virginia-general-assembly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost no new gun legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year to stem the ongoing carnage. It was as if the blood-soaked status quo was acceptable.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than</span><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">44,300 people died</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of gun violence last year nationwide, down slightly from 2021; 54% of those killings were suicides, the Gun Violence Archive reports. Firearms are the leading cause of death among children ages 1 to 17 in Virginia, according to statistics provided by the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, you can blame philosophical differences among the parties for a lack of progress in the Assembly, as the</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/amid-divide-on-how-to-curb-gun-violence-a-bill-heads-to-the-governor/article_1b39f5c6-bf77-11ed-9acf-5f9d41e72a06.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted. Democrats, who control the state Senate, tend to focus on preventing violence and seeking holistic solutions. Republicans, who control the House of Delegates, often prefer boosting prison terms for specific crimes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I favor the former approach because it focuses, in part, on the underlying reasons why people choose guns to settle disputes. Intervention can prevent foolish and fatal decision-making. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the few gun-related bills sent to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s desk provides a tax credit up to $300 if a resident buys firearm safety devices, like a gun safe or lock box.</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2387" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2387,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sponsored by Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, gained near-total approval in the General Assembly.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While I believe that there is so much more we need to do and should do to support sensible gun violence prevention in Virginia, the reality is that we have a Republican governor and House majority that would prefer to loosen gun laws rather than tighten them,” Lopez said by email, in explaining his bill’s limited approach.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If this saves even one curious child from hurting themselves or others, or prevents one suicidal teen from taking their life, it is worth it,” he added.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is reviewing the legislation, a gubernatorial spokeswoman said Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s telling that this sensible, non-controversial bill even garnered the support of the National Rifle Association, an organization usually hostile to limits on firearms. “This is certainly an initiative we have supported in other states. We&#8217;re happy to support this one here as well,” D.J. Spiker, NRA state and local government affairs director for Virginia,</span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/nra-gun-control-groups-find-common-ground-on-gun-safety-bill" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said at an earlier General Assembly hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An NRA spokeswoman told me this week she wasn’t sure when the Fairfax-based group last endorsed similar legislation in the commonwealth. I doubt it was recently.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the NRA website contends, with its typical hyperbole: “Our rights are under attack like never before. Join today.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really? Americans own</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/24/we-must-do-something-to-stem-this-wanton-bloodshed/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 400 million firearms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s more than one handgun, rifle or shotgun for every man, woman and infant in the United States. If gun rights are truly “under attack,” what would the nation look like with no pushback against firearms? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s residents will take </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">progress on curtailing gun tragedies – especially those involving children and young adults. Last year, the</span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/crime/study-gun-violence-surpasses-car-accidents-leading-cause-death-teens/291-01114b8a-ba6b-4ef6-9a62-9d9dbba6c9ef" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">American Academy of Pediatrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported gunshots have now surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of death for teenagers in the country.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look what’s happened just over the past 10 days in the commonwealth: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/babies-are-killing-babies-aunt-begs-for-change-after-nephew-fatally-shot-by-accident/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marquan Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 13, was fatally shot Friday night in Richmond in an apparent accident. Authorities said he had been making a video using guns as props when one fired. “We have too many damn guns in this community,” Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney said.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-students-filming-video-guns-as-props-boy-killed-march-11-2023" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three other Richmond students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were injured in a shooting later that night. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-child-shoots-teen-norfolk-20230313-c64fbukwh5b4bh63jyunnuslyu-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An 11-year-old boy has been accused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of shooting and seriously wounding a 17-year-old boy Sunday in Norfolk.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Richmond circuit court judge sentenced</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/35-years-in-case-judge-calls-cold-blooded-murder/article_98f3dfc0-be7f-11ed-b92d-d35d55000e7b.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian J. Alexander Algarin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 17 at the time of a 2021 ambush killing, to serve 35 years in prison for gunning down his former friend.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2023/03/13/student-found-with-gun-richmond-middle-school/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Boushall Middle School student</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Richmond was found with an unloaded gun at the school Monday, police said.  </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly,</span><a href="https://www.norfolk.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=6529" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a Granby High School student</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was charged for bringing a gun to the Norfolk school on Tuesday. Norfolk police said the handgun had been stolen.  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brief list was culled from local media outlets around Virginia. Imagine what the tally would have been if I’d checked every daily news source and included people of all ages.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How is this acceptable? Why, when it comes to guns, are we so radically different from other</span><a href="https://www.healthdata.org/acting-data/gun-violence-united-states-outlier" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wealthy, industrialized nations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph Richardson Jr. is a gun violence researcher and professor of African-American studies and medical anthropology at the University of Maryland. He told me one key to reducing gun violence is more intervention and prevention at the local level. He also cited programs that do street outreach and defuse conflicts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group called</span><a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/we_know_how_to_prevent_gun_violence_now_we_need_to_scale_it" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Cred</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has had some success by targeting specific neighborhoods there using street outreach, counseling and employment. The group works in a city, however, that</span><a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/chicago-crime-spikes-in-2022-but-first-drop-in-murder-since-pandemic/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">suffered more than 800 homicides in 2021 and 695 last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, Richardson said he and other associates delve more into possible solutions instead of looking solely at firearms. “Just focusing on the guns is a narrow and myopic approach,” he told me. Rather, researchers want to know why people are picking up guns and causing so many deaths and injuries.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That tack suggests gun control advocates have already lost. It’s a sobering conclusion.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While reporting this column, President Joe Biden</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/14/biden-sign-new-executive-order-aimed-gun-violence/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">signed an executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increasing the number of background checks for gun sales, but he also said Congress could do even more to promote gun safety. He also has called for an assault weapons ban;</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/06/02/gun-control-solutions-that-work/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">one was in effect from 1994 to 2004</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the tax credit bill, the Virginia General Assembly incentivized gun owners to safeguard their weapons. That’s a small, positive step. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not nearly enough.  </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State lawmakers and consumer activists say the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/25/general-assembly-deal-sets-dominion-profits-for-two-years-while-overhauling-regulatory-system/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">new legislation overseeing Dominion Energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which places strong regulatory control back with the State Corporation Commission and adjusts the utility’s profit margin, is a huge win for customers across the commonwealth. Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who played a key role in the negotiations, will almost certainly sign it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dominion has been nickel-and-diming Virginians, and the General Assembly has been letting them,” Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville, told me. This year’s legislation has “been a long time coming.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is definitely a dramatic improvement in the regulatory structure for Virginians,” said Will Cleveland, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, an advocacy group. Since 2007, he said, the state had reduced regulatory authority over the electric monopoly.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This time, the needle moved in the other direction,” Cleveland added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank goodness.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why do I feel so much queasiness expecting that Dominion will roll over its 5 million-plus customers in Virginia once again, no matter the assurances to the contrary? Dominion provides service to roughly two-thirds of the state’s residential customers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executives at the Richmond-based utility have long dictated the terms of state oversight and legislation, then laughed all the way to the bank. They’ve essentially written previous bills in the Assembly, as news articles have noted.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one period in the early 2000s, Dominion had so-called “excess earnings” of $860 million. In 2018, it earned</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/dominion-earned-278-million-more-than-permitted-in-2018-regulators-find/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">almost $278 million more than it was allowed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Plus, a sweeping grid transformation act deferred calculating refunds to customers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1997, Dominion has donated more to state politicians than any other corporation, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. That status has been eclipsed in more recent years by</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/21/a-multi-millionaire-set-out-to-counter-dominion-now-hes-the-states-biggest-campaign-donor/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a hedge fund billionaire who’s fought Dominion’s influence over legislators with his own donations and through his Clean Virginia political action committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there’s this bit of unseemly chumminess my former Virginian-Pilot colleague Margaret Edds revealed: In 2006, as she was trying to track down Sen. Tommy Norment, R-Williamsburg, she learned he was on an annual hunting trip in Georgia with Tom Farrell, Dominion’s then-head honcho.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appearances matter, regardless of the rationale. The junkets raised questions of ethics and impartiality. (Farrell died in 2021, right after he retired from the utility.</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/24/general-assembly-tracker-everyone-who-says-they-arent-coming-back-next-year/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Norment, the current minority leader, just announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his retirement from the Senate.)  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/25/general-assembly-deal-sets-dominion-profits-for-two-years-while-overhauling-regulatory-system/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Virginia Mercury’s Charlie Paullin wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the new legislation sets Dominion’s profit margin at 9.7% for two years. After that, the SCC will be able to set the profit margin based on its discretion.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current profit margin – the amount Dominion is allowed to earn in addition to the costs of providing service to Virginia customers – is 9.35%, so that’s a win for the energy provider. This also strengthens Dominion when it goes to the bond market to seek capital to build new projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other provisions include, to put it simply, a switch that will lower average residential bills by $6 to $7 a month. That’s not a ton of money for individual families, but no one will give the money back. I know I won’t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This legislation is a win for consumers and regulatory oversight,” Aaron Ruby, Dominion spokesman, said by email of the deal. “It will lower electricity bills for our customers, reduce the impact of rising fuel costs and strengthen SCC oversight.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s true. Yet Dominion isn’t giving everything away, either. It certainly didn’t in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Albert Pollard Jr., a lobbyist for the Virginia Poverty Law Center and former state legislator, discussed Dominion’s repeated victories at the state level in a recent</span><a href="https://richmond.com/zzstyling/view-oped-sig/opinion-dominion-faces-the-consequences-of-its-actions/article_5383ffda-ae29-11ed-918a-2fa93f16f523.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">op-ed in the Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He disparaged Dominion’s ability to use “its powerful legislative allies and legislative trickery to boost profits.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pollard listed several key points since 2007 in which he said Dominion resisted true regulation and gained benefits. They included: a 2009 rate settlement case that allowed the utility to avoid over earnings; the 2013 storm write-down legislation; and legislation in 2020 that allowed the utility to avoid competition for offshore wind.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The SCC starting in 2025 will have full regulatory control,” Pollard told me in an interview, adding the commission hasn’t had that in more than a dozen years. That’s consequential.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what’s changed since the mid-2000s? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new crop of legislators ascended to power, joining existing ones who were already critical of the utility.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were skeptical of Dominion’s repeated jeremiads that it required relief and a hands-off approach.They include Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, who just won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax, Hudson and former Del. Jay Jones, D-Norfolk.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, lots of lawmakers – mainly Democrats –</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/herring-tells-blue-virginia-he-wont-take-dominion-money/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">pledged not to accept</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dominion financial contributions over roughly the past half-dozen years. Many got</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/10/21/a-multi-millionaire-set-out-to-counter-dominion-now-hes-the-states-biggest-campaign-donor/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">donations from Bills or Clean Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (Some Democrats, though, have been among the utility’s biggest supporters, including</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/27/on-one-powerful-senate-committee-elections-definitely-have-consequences/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dick Saslaw of Fairfax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the soon-to-retire majority leader.) </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/24/virginia-youngkin-dominion-energy-assembly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Large corporations also sought tighter controls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Dominion rates, including Wegmans and AWS, the web services arm of Amazon.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, Youngkin made a huge push to clamp down on Dominion. That might have convinced some Republicans to jump on board. The governor previously  criticized high energy costs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can see all of our ideas back in our all-American, all-of-the-above energy plan,” Youngkin said as the Dominion deal was announced. “… We felt, along with a bipartisan group of senators and delegates, that there was a moment to really reset. The first big thing we wanted to do was make sure that we were protecting consumers.”   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t see Dominion capitulating. The company remains a behemoth. The year 2025 will provide a good barometer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m hoping for the best. And keeping the Tums handy. </span></p>

That mantra, though, doesn’t pay for the many new schools we need around the state," writes columnist Roger Chesley. (Chesterfield Public Schools)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State legislators know Virginia’s aging schools are crumbling and need to be replaced – to the tune of $25 billion for K-12 buildings that are at least a half-century old. The General Assembly’s own ad hoc</span><a href="http://dls.virginia.gov/commissions/scm.htm" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Commission on School Construction and Modernization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said so about the 1,000-plus structures around the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what children face every day:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a</span><a href="https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/exasperated-community-members-ask-why-must-charlottesville-choose-between-a-new-middle-school-and-public-housing/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">leaky roof, aging HVAC system,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> few windows and a foreboding feeling of darkness at Buford Middle School in Charlottesville. Plumbing problems and outdated bathrooms greet youngsters at Westside Elementary in Isle of Wight County, a schools spokesperson told me; parts of the building date to 1928, a year before the Great Depression hit.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/education/heres-what-comes-next-for-wythe-high-school-plans/article_82752ac1-5f0c-5d4e-91c2-849cdfaa152f.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pests and leaky ceilings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hinder learning at George Wythe High School in Richmond.</span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2022-03-04/virginias-schools-are-crumbling-how-did-the-state-get-here" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Moisture, radon and asbestos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plague the schools in Bristol, where at least one building is more than a century old.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These aren’t conditions schoolchildren should have to confront every day. They should focus on learning, not dodging rodents and smelly water. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers also know the money the state has allocated to help school divisions build anew is chump change. Legislation passed last year provides</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/august/name-938014-en.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/august/name-938014-en.html" target="_blank">25 billion</a> in a mix of grants and loans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That amount includes $450 million for high-need schools’ construction, expansion and modernization projects.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loans must be repaid, by the way – no easy task for some divisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price tag for new buildings with up-to-date technology can be staggering. </span><a href="https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2023/feb/02/new-george-wythe-high-school-will-cost-record-8611/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes that the cost to build the new George Wythe High School has ballooned; the facility, which will educate 1,800 students, will cost $154 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities face the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/10/the-general-assembly-keeps-finding-ways-to-dodge-virginias-school-construction-problem/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">primary responsibility for building new schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and handling major renovations on existing ones in Virginia. No one disputes that.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the commonwealth </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">help out, given the ongoing backlog. Current state construction funding, while welcome, is akin to offering a thirsty man a single drop of water. The gesture makes the giver feel better, but it doesn’t solve the emergency.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s where political philosophies hinder practical solutions. Republicans generally believe in tax cuts before all else. They also oppose attempts to raise taxes, even when the need is documented and the revenues are earmarked for specific services.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s even more absurd that</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/24/virginia-explained-why-can-just-nine-localities-impose-a-sales-tax-for-school-capital-projects/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a handful of communities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already can raise state taxes for school-building after they won Assembly approval.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That fact doesn’t seem to matter to Republicans, especially in the GOP-controlled House of Delegates. They’ve repeatedly rejected providing that option to every locality. (In this</span><a href="https://www.law.virginia.edu/news/202003/it-time-home-rule-virginia" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dillon Rule state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cities and counties must beg the legislature for approval of certain tasks. Lawmakers take delight in the displays of supplication.)  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jennifer McClellan, the state senator elected to the U.S. House of Representatives last week, made the latest bid for school construction funding. The Richmond Democrat sponsored</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1408" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1408</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would’ve allowed every locality a mechanism to hold a voter referendum. If residents approved, the localities could’ve raised the sales tax up to one percent for as many as 20 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill passed the Senate with some Republican support. A GOP-dominated House subcommittee, though, tabled it.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the five Republican delegates who voted against it, including panel chair </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, returned my requests for comment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a hearing, Byron said the aforementioned construction fund plus taxes from sports betting should help localities pay for new schools.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan, in an interview with me the day</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/mcclellan-beats-benjamin-in-special-election-for-virginia-congressional-seat/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">after her historic election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Congress, told me that gaming taxes aren’t enough because of the magnitude of the problem. “We need a full menu of options,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s clear. Besides, every year of delay tends to increase construction costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The congresswoman-elect also noted that the state refuses to give cities and counties the tools to help themselves – except for the nine localities that were earlier granted that ability. “We need to give it to all of them,” McClellan told me.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otherwise, localities usually have to rely on local real estate taxes to pay for school construction. The problem is, that source of funding has to pay for a whole slew of other services, too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan has a first-hand view of the challenges. She’s the chair of the Commission on School Construction and Modernization. The funding bill she sponsored is one of the commission’s recommendations.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan was also part of a team that included Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, that toured distressed schools around the state. She readily ticks off some of the problems she saw in various schools: Rats had eaten through a wall to get to a pantry. Electrical wiring had caught fire. Schoolkids put out buckets to catch water from leaky roofs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/11/as-election-year-general-assembly-session-begins-youngkin-says-virginia-is-on-right-path/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Gov. Youngkin wants to burnish his tax-cutting prowess</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and conservative bona fides. Republicans in the Assembly want to support his course of action. Democrats would do the same if someone in their party was governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need to pay for school construction isn’t going away, however. Instead of engaging in nonsensical debates about</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/14/youngkin-administration-opposes-shielding-menstrual-app-data-from-search-warrants/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">menstrual tracking apps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or demonizing the books that</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/16/democratic-led-panel-kills-parental-rights-bills-on-school-books-gender-identity/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">school divisions use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, legislators should help localities help their students.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No new taxes” makes for a great bumper sticker and campaign prop. That mantra, though, doesn’t pay for the many new schools we need around the state. </span></p>

(Kate Masters/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News this week that the</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/12/upshot/child-maternal-mortality-rich-poor.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">richest Black mothers and their babies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are twice as likely to die in the year after childbirth than their white counterparts is just one indicator of why Colin Greene, the onetime chief of the Virginia Health Department, was rejected by the state Senate.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar medical facts contribute to why Democratic legislators, African-Americans around Virginia and department employees were so appalled by Greene’s pronouncements last year about racism. The state health commissioner downplayed more than a century of</span><a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/newsletter-article/2021/jan/medical-mistrust-among-black-americans" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">second-class treatment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1516047113" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">stereotypes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and structural barriers that Black people and other minorities have faced regarding health care in this country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The account Sunday in The New York Times, citing a study by the nonpartisan</span><a href="https://www.nber.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Bureau of Economic Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about births in California, also found maternal mortality rates were just as high among the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">richest </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black women as they were among </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">poor </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">white women.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not race, it’s racism,” an economist focused on public health and obstetrics told The Times. “The data are quite clear that this isn’t about biology. This is about the environments where we live, where we work, where we play, where we sleep.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly. You can’t improve health care for Black people without noting the circumstances and structures that have long harmed them. That’s why the comments by Greene, the state’s one-time top public health official, were so reprehensible.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/15/racial-disparities-health-care-youngkin/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported last year that Greene said he had yet to see “compelling evidence” that racism played a role in well documented maternal and infant health disparities for Black mothers and their babies. He also took issue with the term racism, telling The Post that “if you say ‘racism,’ you’re blaming White people.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His obtuseness was insulting. There has been no shortage of reports and data proving that Black people have suffered from unequal treatment and poor outcomes involving medical care.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic-controlled state Senate, along party lines,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/07/senate-democrats-boot-youngkin-health-commissioner-two-other-appointees/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sent Greene packing last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Gov. Glenn Youngkin had named him to the post in 2022, but he didn’t face confirmation proceedings until the current General Assembly session.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Maternal Mortality Review Team, which identifies pregnancy-related deaths and develops ways to produce preventable deaths, continued doing its work as usual under Greene, a program official told me. It recently prepared a report due every three years </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title32.1/chapter8/section32.1-283.8/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s required by state code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene’s dismissiveness on racism was more than just an issue of semantics. Black people and other people of color have faced neglect and worse in navigating health care in America. They live with those effects every day.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear of alienating whites should never outweigh actually assisting people long marginalized in this country.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fundamental purpose of the Health Department is to focus on some of our most vulnerable communities and those in the health system,” Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, told me. Greene “didn’t seem to have any appreciation for that.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forget that Native American, Black and Latino people suffered from higher rates of </span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01466" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">hospitalizations and deaths related to COVID-19 compared with whites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Longstanding disparities and inequities pre-COVID aren’t hard to find. Greene must have known that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1946, for example, as Jim Crow reigned, the Hospital Survey and Construction Act provided money to build public hospitals and long-term care facilities. But it also allowed states to construct racially separate and unequal facilities, the</span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01466" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">journal Health Affairs reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also the myth that Black people and Black skin are somehow resistant to pain, and that they don’t need pain meds in the same quantities that whites do. Some of this claptrap can be traced to the work of</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/nyregion/nyc-sims-statue-central-park-monument.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">J. Marion Sims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, often touted as “the father of modern gynecology.” He conducted experiments on enslaved Black women without anesthesia.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century doctor was developing a treatment for vesicovaginal fistula, which resulted from vaginal tears during complicated deliveries. But the enslaved women couldn’t consent, first of all.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sims’ decision not to administer anesthesia was akin to sadism, too. My colleague Samantha Willis included Sims</span><a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/its-not-just-confederate-monuments-all-statues-of-problematic-men-must-go" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in a 2018 magazine article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Confederate era monuments that were coming down, including one of Sims in Central Park in New York.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vestiges of Sims’ rationale exist today.</span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1516047113" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">White medical students and residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> held misguided beliefs about biological differences between Black and white people, 2016 studies found, and this led to racial bias in pain treatment.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or consider the federal money that’s been allotted to<a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/cystic-fibrosis/#frequency" target="_blank"> cystic fibrosis</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(CF), a disease that primarily affects whites, versus the dollars devoted to</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sickle cell disease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (SCD), which affects Black and Latino people and people from some Mediterranean nations. (Full disclosure: My late sister Saundra, who died last year at age 65, suffered horribly from sickle cell over her lifetime.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both sickle cell and cystic fibrosis are inherited disorders. There are roughly</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">100,000 Americans with sickle cell disease</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/disease/cystic_fibrosis.htm" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">35,000 with CF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet, over an 11-year period,</span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2763606?" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">federal funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was greater per person with CF, at $2,807, compared to sickle cell sufferers, at $812.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Despite SCD being 3 times as prevalent as CF, both diseases received a similar amount of federal government research funding between 2008 and 2018,”  the Journal of the American Medical Association</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Network Open reported. “The funding disparity was markedly increased when factoring in disease-specific private foundation funding.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For these reasons and more, Youngkin should appoint someone more sensitive about racial bias in health care than Greene.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evidence is overwhelming that problems exist. The new health commissioner shouldn’t proclaim otherwise. </span></p>

Totally predictable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s prolonged,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/02/despite-public-pushback-board-of-ed-accepts-draft-history-standards-for-first-review/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">excruciating review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the state’s K-12 history and social science standards – now on its third major draft, for goodness’ sake – should&#8217;ve occurred with much less meddling by state officials. What could’ve been a straightforward exercise in updating the curriculum has become mired in politicization by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suppose this morass was preordained ever since Youngkin, on the day he was inaugurated, issued</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-1-Ending-the-Use-of-Inherently-Divisive-Concepts.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order No. One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to end “critical race theory.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me repeat: CRT, an academic framework that explains how race and racism affect people’s lives,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/20/youngkin-quickly-embraces-culture-wars-telegraphing-a-worrisome-four-years/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">isn’t taught in public schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the commonwealth. It’s primarily a college-level course. Conservatives promoted sinister connotations of the term to boost voter turnout in elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The campaign talking point helped fuel Youngkin’s base, and the Republican novice was elected in 2021.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applying such misrepresentation to the nuts-and-bolts curriculum used in schools, however, doesn’t work nearly as well. Especially when you reject the reasoned, deliberative advice of</span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/35742/638054987968770000" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 200</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> historians, educators and others who want students to truly learn about Virginia and the nation’s past – no matter the faults or achievements.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some background:  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title22.1/chapter13.2/section22.1-253.13:1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Standards of Learning for various subjects must be revised at least every seven years. The history and social science standards were originally adopted in 1995. They were set to be reviewed by 2022 in a process that</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2022-08-11/state-education-board-to-consider-new-history-standards" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">began under then-Gov. Ralph Northam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/17/missing-context-political-bias-some-of-critics-objections-to-virginias-new-history-standards/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historians, division leaders,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> parents, museum officials and others, working over two years, provided input for the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/17/board-of-ed-delays-first-review-of-new-history-social-science-standards-amid-public-outcry/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">first draft released in August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Fancy that: People with expertise in the content – </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">those with a political focus – were tasked with such an important job for Virginia’s children.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jillian Balow, state superintendent of public instruction under Youngkin,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/17/virginia-board-of-education-delays-history-standards-review/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">then asked to delay public hearings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the standards. Administration members claimed there were typographical errors and content problems.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president of the Virginia Board of Education said the department had the document for seven months and could’ve made corrections. Besides, over 5,000 comments had already been submitted, concerned citizens noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The delay had more than a whiff of political chicanery, especially because so much work took place before Youngkin became governor. His minions, some newly appointed by Youngkin to the board, were trying to override it. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/17/board-of-ed-delays-first-review-of-new-history-social-science-standards-amid-public-outcry/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second draft</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was released in November. A Northam appointee on the board called it “a disaster.” As the Virginia Mercury’s Nathaniel Cline reported, Balow faced criticism for several issues, including a reference to Indigenous people as “immigrants.”  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.veanea.org/vea-reacts-to-politically-motivated-history-standards/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Education Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said that draft “represents the worst kind of politically motivated meddling with academic curriculum. The standards are full of overt political bias, outdated language to describe enslaved people and American Indians, highly subjective framing of American moralism and conservative ideals, coded racist overtures throughout,” and more.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillsdale College in Michigan provided input for the second draft.</span><a href="https://www.sikhcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Hamkae-Center-and-Sikh-Coalition-Letter-VA-History-and-Social-Standards-SOLs.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Some critics say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the conservative college has published a curriculum that’s been assailed “from renowned historians for inaccuracies and biases.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That brings us to Draft Three, if you’re keeping score. It was released in January. The state board accepted it for review last week on a 5-3 vote, with appointees of Democratic governors opposing it. Dozens of speakers accused the newest draft of “whitewashing” parts of history and excluding issues such as the American labor movement.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cassandra Newby-Alexander is a longtime Norfolk State University history professor. She co-chaired the</span><a href="https://www.education.virginia.gov/initiatives/aahec/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">African American History Education Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which helped craft proposed changes to the standards.  Newby-Alexander told me she’s been incensed by the gamesmanship over the history standards and has written letters to state officials about the problems. “The governor and his people want to walk us back to the 1950s,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her Jan. 23 letter, sent after the third draft was released, contends the new Department of Education administration has chosen to ignore its own guidelines “and insert an entirely new draft for approval by the Virginia Board of Education that did not follow any process of creation or review.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Instead, it appears to be a partisan document replete with errors so egregious that no educator will be able to follow the document and educate their students given the historical errors and chronological organization of the information.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest draft “skips over most of American history, emphasizing only those areas that interprets the nation idealistically and without any critical review of the past,” the professor wrote. “Indeed, the draft approaches American history from a fundamentally flawed perspective, carefully inserting conservative themes throughout and ignoring the realities of our past, such as the long history of enslavement, discrimination, marginalization of people of color, and genocide (in some cases).” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been reporting and writing in Virginia since 1997. Though I could be mistaken, I don’t recall any previous history SOL update being so controversial.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, this is how Charles Pyle, an education department spokesman, described to me the SOL history review process in 2015: A draft went to the Board of Education for first review in October 2014. The board scheduled to approve the standards in January 2015, but it was delayed for edits the board requested. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Board of Education approved the 2015 History and Social Science Standards of Learning in March 2015,” Pyle said by email.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That five-month timeline has already been exceeded this go-round. Only two drafts were needed in 2015, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of mucking up the review process, state education folks should’ve focused on other critical issues. Here’s one: Try not shortchanging the money</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/31/virginia-public-schools-seek-solutions-after-dept-of-ed-error-leads-to-201-million-shortfall/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for school divisions by more than $200 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because of a calculating glitch, as Balow admitted last month.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also the fight over </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/07/senate-democrats-boot-youngkin-health-commissioner-two-other-appointees/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s appointment of Suparna Dutta to the Board of Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Senate Democrats, who have a majority, this week rejected the confirmation of Dutta, an Indian immigrant who has criticized progressive education policies she believes overemphasize the importance of race, as the Virginia Mercury reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SOLs history controversy will allow Youngkin to tamp down on white guilt and muddy the waters over racism’s impact in America. It might be good for his future electoral aspirations.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the state&#8217;s schoolchildren? Not at all. </span></p>

It’s now up for sale. (Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement that</span><a href="https://invest.jll.com/us/en/listings/retail/macarthur-center-regional-mall-investment-sale-norfolk-va-unitedstates" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk’s downtown mall is up for sale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t quite a death knell for the complex, but it’s surely a worrisome clanging. It’s naïve to think otherwise, given the track record of malls across Virginia</span><a href="https://time.com/4865957/death-and-life-shopping-mall/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and nationwide in recent years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news about MacArthur Center in Norfolk, though, is especially dispiriting. The three-story mall opened in 1999, making it a mere adolescent (in mall years), compared to similar behemoths elsewhere in America. Norfolk officials waited decades to bring the formerly vacant site to fruition, when they could’ve wagered on other development projects instead.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MacArthur Center has coped with the closing of retail outlets, the relentless shift to online shopping – turbocharged during the COVID-19 pandemic –</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/10/a-third-of-americas-malls-will-disappear-by-next-year-jan-kniffen.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and a general saturation of malls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other consumer options. Occupancy at MacArthur Center is only 62%, according to</span><a href="https://invest.jll.com/us/en/listings/retail/macarthur-center-regional-mall-investment-sale-norfolk-va-unitedstates" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones Lang LaSalle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which handles real estate and investment management services.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have been closing nationally,” James V. Koch, economics professor at Old Dominion University and founding director of its Dragas Center for Economic Analysis and Policy, told me this week. “It’s not a problem native to Norfolk, Virginia at all. Lots of malls [must] repurpose themselves, or they’re going to go out of existence.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The land the mall sits on is leased from the city’s housing authority. Local officials have put on a brave face following last week’s news.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are hopeful that this move is the first step in reimagining the MacArthur Center property,” City Manager Chip Filer said through a spokesperson. “The city looks forward to working in partnership with any potential new owners should the property sell.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a very rosy view. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The struggles MacArthur faces, of course, aren’t unique. The same story has played out around the state.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/business/local/last-tenants-to-leave-virginia-center-commons-by-the-end-of-october/article_13631e3a-401f-573d-a0e0-abd84f43db31.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Center Commons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Glen Allen, operating since 1991, closed last year. The site is part of a redevelopment plan that includes a new sports and convocation center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home Depot bought Charlottesville Fashion Square Mall last year,</span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/home-depot-buys-charlottesville-fashion-square-mall/article_03a34d54-3471-11ed-89a6-6bdf654e1e95.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Daily Progress reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The mall, built in the 1980s, “has struggled for relevance,” the newspaper reported then. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/local/vp-nw-military-circle-proposals-20221229-oce33tmh3naornflmpmvtugf4a-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Military Circle Mall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Norfolk, which opened in 1970, closed just this week. Back in 2010, I’d written how it was doing a poor job of attracting customers and that its hotel had already been closed for a year. Current negotiations have stalled between the city of Norfolk and a private development group to overhaul the sprawling 75-acre site, The Virginian-Pilot reported recently.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I visited MacArthur Center midday Tuesday. I noticed several shuttered stores festooned with artwork to make things look less drab – and vacant. Customer traffic was light; you could’ve thrown a baseball down some corridors and not hit anyone. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34305" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:225px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3345-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-34305" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3345-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3345-225x300.jpg 225w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3345-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3345-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3345-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3345-scaled.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  One of the main atriums inside MacArthur Center was nearly absent of customers Tuesday. (Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While trying to interview merchants and customers, two security guards told me the mall is “private property” and such Q&amp;As were prohibited. One guard ordered me to leave.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if my walking through the mall and talking to idle store employees was MacArthur’s biggest headache.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pamela Katrancha owns Garden Gazebo, which sells garden-related merchandise. She’s operated a variety of shops for more than 30 years and has run the mall store since 2015. She isn’t worried about news that MacArthur is for sale, yet she’s heard the rumors the mall could,  eventually, be torn down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody really knows the answer,” Katrancha told me in a phone interview. She credited mall management for its support of merchants. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve hung in there at the mall,” she added. “It changed when Nordstrom left.” The departure of that</span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/nordstrom-closes-for-good-at-macarthur-center/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">original anchor store, in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was a big blow.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The success of MacArthur, or whatever might take its place, is tied psychologically to the overall prospects for downtown Norfolk. That’s partly because of the lengthy debate about what should’ve gone there and the long road to opening mall doors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local leaders exhibited huge patience over the decades in building the site, which is near a memorial to the same-named World War II general. The mall sits on a footprint of a much-ballyhooed “17 Acres” downtown. Newspaper archives tell the story:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tract had been slums and warehouses in the 1950s. Those structures were eventually razed during urban renewal. The site spent many years as a parking lot. Various development proposals rose and fell; one even included an amusement park.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mall finally gained consistent momentum – and financing – in the mid-1990s. Its construction coincided with other changes that spurred downtown Norfolk’s rebirth: the arrival of a community college campus; and the opening of stores and restaurants on Granby Street, a major thoroughfare.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mall eventually encompassed roughly 23 acres. It has 934,000 square feet over three stories.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time, MacArthur has faced escalating challenges. Shootings,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-macarthur-center-parking-garage-shooting-20200625-n5cvugbhqfgf3b25q6ai6jtnm4-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">including one in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, scared off customers. Major retailers that occupied several floors,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/business/consumer/vp-bz-macarthur-jcrew-20200115-wlwhkuzspbae7bx6uo3pnq6en4-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">including Forever 21,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> departed.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor did anyone foresee the colossus that</span><a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/amazon-opens-for-business" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online retailer Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would become. It opened in 1995, a few years before MacArthur served its first customers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, it was developed at a time when many of the trends nationally and economically speaking were moving against it,” ODU’s Koch said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After waiting decades to open MacArthur, the city and mall leadership must feel snakebit by the upheaval in shopping habits. Still, they have no choice but to regroup, adapt and plot a new course. </span></p>

I eagerly tore open the envelope the credit reporting firm sent me.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would the check be a cool $125,</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/opinion/equifax-settlement.html?searchResultPosition=4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the feds originally touted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in helping reach the class-action settlement? Or, given the humongous number of claimants, something much, much less?  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s inattention to detail led to a massive</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/business/equifax-breach-settlement.html?searchResultPosition=3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data hack in 2017.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The intrusion compromised the personal data of 147 million people – nearly half the U.S. population.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to file a claim and keep abreast of developments. It took several years for the payouts to start. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019,</span> <a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2019-07-22/virginia-consumers-get-4-million-in-equifax-data-breach-settlement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">then-Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said that, despite knowing about a key vulnerability in its software, Equifax didn’t fully patch its system or replace software that monitored its network for suspicious activity.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was among 4 million Virginians affected.</span> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/payments-from-equifax-settlement-over-2017-data-breach-are-going-out.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our names, birthdates and Social Security numbers were imperiled,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> though</span><a href="https://www.equifax.com/newsroom/all-news/-/story/equifax-statement-on-distribution-of-benefits-by-the-court-appointed-third-party-settlement-claims-administrator/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Equifax still says</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there’s no proof the data “has been sold or used.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll see. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would the settlement check let me go on a mini-shopping spree? Or could I barely afford a combo meal? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drum roll: It was a measly $5.21.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Class-action lawsuits like this one, with millions of plaintiffs, usually mean individuals receive negligible amounts. Besides, the lawyers representing the class get a major cut.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A $425 million consumer restitution fund was established as part of the Equifax settlement, but the “fine print”</span> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/equifax-settlement-payment-explained-data-breach-2022-12" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said just $31 million was being used for reimbursements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If more than 248,000 people submitted claims – a tiny percentage of 147 million – payments would be lower than $125 to each person. Folks could opt for free credit monitoring instead. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried reaching Kenneth Canfield in Atlanta and Norman Siegel in Kansas City, two of the attorneys representing consumers as part of “class counsel.” I wanted to know, in part, how much they received. Neither responded to my messages by Tuesday afternoon.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://topclassactions.com/faqs/who-pays-legal-fees-in-a-class-action-lawsuit/#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A legal website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted plaintiffs’ counsel often “receives 25 to 33 percent of the amount of damages as their attorney fees.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for Equifax directed me to a company</span> <a href="https://www.equifax.com/newsroom/all-news/-/story/equifax-statement-on-distribution-of-benefits-by-the-court-appointed-third-party-settlement-claims-administrator/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement on the disbursements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span> <a href="https://www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settlement administrator’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You bet I’m cashing the check.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And cursing Equifax for its cavalier and cheap response to data security. </span></p>

Scores of people witnessed a murder and stayed quiet – except for posting photos of the crime on the internet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well over 100 people were there,” Wright told me this week, “and not one person came forward.” Several did, however, publish photos online of the mortally wounded Miller, he noted grimly.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not human nature at its finest.</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/article_1d207eef-3c5f-5051-a244-6855d4f37d69.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though 30 officers were at the murder scene,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people there were mum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake, the state’s second-biggest city, has a strong record of arresting homicide suspects and charging them. With 25 homicides in 2022, police arrested suspects in 68 percent of the cases,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-homicide-clearance-hampton-roads-20230115-bdhyzscfhfhi5gkeix7aitgdk4-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginian-Pilot reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the 2011 shooting of Miller, just 18, still hasn’t been solved. Police said Miller was shot during an argument in the parking lot around 1:45 one morning. The high school graduate left behind a wife and an infant son, according to published reports and</span><a href="https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pilotonline/name/daevon-miller-obituary?id=26391027" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an online obituary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fatal shooting is an example of a disturbing, persistent trend across America:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many police departments, often in large cities, aren’t “closing” – or clearing – a huge percentage of slayings. “Closing” means police have arrested someone or identified a suspect, now dead or possibly in prison. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/07/police-murder-clearance-rate/661500/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly half of the homicides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country aren’t being closed, according to the most recent statistics. The percentage is way down from the 1960s, in the pre-Miranda era and at a time when departments weren’t scrutinized closely, so many likely fudged the stats.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The percentage of homicide cases cleared today, though, is still much lower than the 1990s.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News articles and criminology experts say the keys to arresting suspects are witnesses willing to talk and greater public trust in police. That willingness and trust were damaged, especially among Blacks and Latinos, following the videotaped killing of George Floyd and similar police-involved slayings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before that, however, relations weren’t great because police were often seen as occupying forces in Black and Latino neighborhoods.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has resulted in efforts to bring murderers to justice falling short. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some witnesses fear retaliation from thugs if they help police and prosecutors. Having enough police personnel to investigate killings is a factor, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s become a circular, self-defeating prophecy: African-Americans are disproportionately represented</span><a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/shr" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">among homicide victims and suspects in the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet, police are less likely to solve a murder when the victim is African-American or Latino, CBS News </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unsolved-murders-crime-without-punishment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This brings to mind a quote by fictitious prosecutor Jack McCoy (embodied by actor Sam Waterston) on the hit TV series “Law and Order”:</span><a href="https://www.quotes.net/movies/law_%252526_order_104109" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“A murder goes unpunished, it&#8217;s bad for business.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, this is a very real truth carrying devastating consequences for relatives and friends of victims in Virginia and across the United States.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When police can’t lock up killers, criminals gain a sense of impunity. They believe they can continue to murder without threat of arrest. Victims’ families never gain closure or justice – and may opt for vigilantism.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commonwealth, compared to other states that release statistics, is doing better than average in closing cases. A chart with a</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unsolved-murders-crime-without-punishment/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 story by CBS News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows Virginia’s clearance rate at 66 percent between 2015 and 2020. Nearby Tennessee, West Virginia, Maryland and Delaware did worse. The national average was around 50 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different pockets in our state, however, face serious challenges.</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-homicide-clearance-hampton-roads-20230115-bdhyzscfhfhi5gkeix7aitgdk4-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pilot noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there were 220 homicides in the seven main cities in Hampton Roads in 2022. About half were cleared through arrest or other means. Norfolk had 63 homicides, the most in Hampton Roads last year, but only 37 percent were cleared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation is better in other Virginia localities.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William County had 10 victims in 2021 and 19 homicide victims in 14 cases in 2022, First Sgt. Jonathan Perok told me by email. Only one case remained open from 2021 and two cases from 2022.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The police department always seeks cooperation in cases, whether that’s directly from those involved in incidents, or from the public who may have information which could assist in solving cases,” he said. When residents are willing to share home surveillance footage and other technology, that helps too, Perok said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County, the state’s largest locality at</span><a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fairfaxcountyvirginia" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.14 million people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, had six active cases among 21 homicide victims in 2021, and just three active cases among 22 homicide victims last year, police there said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s noteworthy that those localities have significantly fewer homicides than some in Hampton Roads. Their populations are wealthier, too. Studies note that communities with </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455929/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher poverty are at higher risk of their residents becoming homicide victims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Asher, a crime analyst, told</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/07/police-murder-clearance-rate/661500/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlantic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year that guns are a big factor in whether cases are closed. Today, almost 80% of murders are committed with guns, while it was 50% in the 1960s.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Firearm murders are much harder to solve,” Asher told The Atlantic. “They take place from farther away. You often have fewer witnesses. There’s less physical evidence. … A higher share of gun violence can lead to a lower clearance rate.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also noted the “geography of murder” is important because certain communities – as I noted earlier – don’t trust the police. Those same communities tend to have fewer homicides solved.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A plea to police: Work harder re-establishing trust. Don’t give up.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A plea to Black and Latino people: Lack of cooperation prevents arrests. There’s no justice.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letting killers off the hook helps the murderers – and nobody else.</span></p>

State legislators, however, consistently fail to meet</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/12/virginia-lags-many-states-in-state-education-funding-analysis-says/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the funding standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set by the Virginia Board of Education for students in K-12 public schools.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We rank near the bottom in per-pupil spending for public education, at a stingy 40th among the states, according to the Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis. That means localities face a huge financial burden to teach children, according to the nonprofit, left-leaning organization based in Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So naturally, Republicans in the General Assembly want to pass voucher legislation that would deplete public education of vital state dollars and direct that money to private schools. Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is among the biggest proponents of the diversion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we are saying as parents is, ‘No more.’ We’re not going to do the same things and expect different results,”</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/05/republican-lawmakers-revive-push-for-school-choice-legislation/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Earle-Sears said last week, according to my Virginia Mercury colleague Nathaniel Cline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sentiment would be just fine if Virginia did, at minimum, its share in fulfilling the Standards of Quality to fund education. We simply won’t know whether schools would improve until the state does a better job of paying for more school counselors, support positions and the like – as it’s supposed to.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Glenn Davis, R-Virginia Beach, is sponsoring</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1508" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1508,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing parents to set up savings accounts to cover educational expenses, including tuition, at private schools. The accounts would be funded with state dollars at roughly $6,600 per child, he said. (I couldn’t find out the estimated hit to state coffers.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of students in Virginia have fallen through the cracks,” Davis told me Wednesday, the same day the General Assembly convened for the 2023 session. “There’s such a huge need, especially in historically Black communities. The resources aren’t there to reach their full potential.” He cited the challenges in</span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/may/12/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-overstates-school-progress-petersburg-va/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as one example.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detractors, including many Democrats, derided the proposal as funneling money to rich families and gutting K-12 education. Davis said no Democrats have sought to be co-sponsors or publicly supported his plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-income families would more likely benefit, Davis said, especially minority students. But as he acknowledged, no income limits are stipulated in the legislation. You can bet families that could take advantage of the program won’t all be struggling, including middle-class ones.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some poor families might not be able to use the proposed “Education Success Accounts” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">because the subsidies won’t pay enough of the costs. A big hurdle in many states is</span><a href="https://www.educationnext.org/going-extra-mile-school-choice-how-five-cities-tackle-challenges-student-transportation/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">transportation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; families themselves or the private schools would have to provide a way for students to get to and from school. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis’ passion is clear when discussing so-called ESAs. He told me he’s visited several states in recent years to study choice initiatives. Davis, who’s carried charter school legislation previously, has also toured schools around the commonwealth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the large-scale education gambit he proposes makes no sense.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if some public schools are failing to educate students, the state should first provide more than the bare minimum of resources before consigning them to the trash heap. The unofficial GOP mantra of “low taxes above all else” has consequences – especially for education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, before the last legislative session, the state of Virginia was still providing less per-student investment in public schools than in 2009 after adjusting for inflation,” said Laura Goren, director of research and education policy at the Commonwealth Institute.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are vouchers the panacea some conservatives claim they are. Any diminution of public schools should have, as a substitute, a strong track record.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many independent analyses of voucher programs suggest they provide only slight boosts in educational markers and test scores. Others say they are negligible or even deleterious – while also harming public schools.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Studies of voucher programs in several U.S. cities, the states of Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, and in Chile and India, find limited improvements at best in student achievement and school district performance from even large-scale programs,” said a</span><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/school-vouchers-are-not-a-proven-strategy-for-improving-student-achievement/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 Economic Policy Institute report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The institute bills itself as an independent, nonprofit think tank. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lack of evidence that vouchers significantly improve student achievement … suggests that an ideological preference for education markets over equity and public accountability is what is driving the push to expand voucher programs,” the article said. Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, has been a huge</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/15/buckle-up-youngkin-budget-proposal-includes-another-1b-in-tax-cuts/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">proponent of school choice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Economic Policy Institute added that voucher programs bring risks, including increased school segregation and the “loss of a common, secular educational experience.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent studies of statewide voucher programs in Louisiana, Ohio, and Indiana “have shown negative effects on student achievement for students in elementary and middle school grades,” according to a</span><a href="https://kappanonline.org/current-landscape-school-choice-united-states-vouchers-charter-schools-berends/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 article in Kappan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a magazine that covers K-12 education.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With vouchers, there’s also a discomfiting whiff of the</span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/massive-resistance/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> private academies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for white children –</span><a href="http://www2.vcdh.virginia.edu/civilrightstv/glossary/topic-024.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">using public money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – that opened during Virginia’s period of Massive Resistance more than a half-century ago. They were designed to prevent integration, even after the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown v. Board of Education</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s impossible to dismiss that shameful piece of history when talking about diverting public money for education in the commonwealth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is primarily a philosophical debate right now, given the divided control of the General Assembly. Republicans have a slight majority in the House of Delegates, and Democrats have the same in the Senate, so the bill probably won’t pass.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, it’s hard to believe shoveling money to private schools would benefit public ones left with fewer dollars.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed voucher program is a bad deal for Virginians – and public education, too. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin recently signaled support for creating</span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/1/HB1400/Introduced/1/408/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Virginia Mass Violence Care Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, pledging $10 million through proposed budget amendments. The nonreverting fund would earn interest, and beneficiaries could tap into money three years after a major shooting, stabbing or</span> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/08/1053690747/charlottesville-car-attack-united-the-right-white-national-organizers" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">car intentionally ramming into protesters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Officials say donations and health insurance tend to dry up by that time.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money in the state fund would be invested in the market, similar to what happens with the Virginia 529 college plan.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a proactive, vital resource – perhaps the first of its kind nationwide, officials say. Yet acknowledging the need for such a fund is so … dispiriting.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all of our memorials,</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/30/guns-not-mental-illness-at-heart-of-americas-terror/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">candlelight vigils</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other gestures of hope following mass shootings, we’ve been getting better and better at providing comfort and support.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preventing such awful, mindless attacks, almost always by gunfire, is another story.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First things first:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kudos to the guv and folks like</span> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/22/mass-violence-fund-proposed/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Samaha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, director of victims advocacy for the VTV Family Outreach Foundation/VTV Care, who worked to create it. Samaha’s daughter Reema was one of the people slain during the shooting massacre at Virginia Tech in 2007; 32 people were killed, and dozens were injured. It remains the</span> <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/fifteen-years-after-most-deadly-us-campus-shooting-what-has-changed-1698379" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deadliest school shooting in the country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trauma is not linear,” Samaha told me this week. “You don’t just get better. It takes time, it takes treatment.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax, credited Samaha, his constituent, with doing “the spade work” in bringing the fund close to fruition.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know there will be incidents over the next decade where multiple numbers of people will be killed,” Petersen told me. That’s a haunting gut punch to all Virginians.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter said by email the fund “is in response to recent mass violence events in the state, including at U.Va. and the Walmart in Chesapeake.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the University of Virginia,</span> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/15/uva-shooting-witness-reveals-details/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">police say a student fatally shot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> three football players and injured two other students on a bus following a class trip to Washington in November. The very next week,</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/23/after-chesapeake-uva-shootings-youngkin-to-propose-mental-health-agenda/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a manager at a Chesapeake Walmart shot and executed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> six coworkers, wounded others and then killed himself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so many guns in circulation and so many grudges – real and</span> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna18169776" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">imagined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – harbored by individuals, law enforcement agencies face an oft-impossible task of ferreting out who will go off, and who’s merely a menace.</span> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/07/11/broad-public-approval-of-new-gun-law-but-few-say-it-will-do-a-lot-to-stem-gun-violence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why so many Americans favor tougher gun-control laws.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One grim question arose almost immediately, at least for me, about the proposed fund: How do you define “mass violence”? Do you count the number of slain and wounded? Do you have a cutoff? Does the crime have to be in public and in view of bystanders? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had trouble getting a straight answer.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/methodology" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gun Violence Archive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a D.C.-based nonprofit, for example, defines a mass  shooting as four </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or more people shot or killed, not including the shooter.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samaha said his organization proposes copying the definition of mass violence used by the federal Office of Victims of Crime in the U.S. Department of Justice. (My messages to spokespersons there weren’t returned.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samaha noted guidelines under the federal </span><a href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/217956NCJRS.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antiterrorism and Emergency Assistance Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> define an act of mass violence as “an intentional violent crime that results in physical, emotional, or psychological injury to a sufficiently large number of people and significantly increases the burden of victim assistance and compensation for the responding jurisdiction.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is more than just a rhetorical exercise. No one wants the proposed fund to be drained quickly. Virginia, though, has its share of crimes where many families are left with grief, haunting recollections from witnessing murders and huge medical bills for survivors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are just two cases I’ve reported on over the past 15 months:  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In late 2021,</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/17/when-gun-violence-and-domestic-violence-intertwine-overhaul-a-culture-of-disdain-and-disrespect/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">authorities arrested a man</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who they say shot dead three women and wounded two others at a Norfolk public housing community. Police cited domestic violence as the motive (one of the wounded women had dated the suspect). A dozen children were playing nearby as the gunfire erupted.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Sierra Jenkins, a 25-year-old Virginian-Pilot reporter, and two other people were shot dead while leaving a restaurant-bar in downtown Norfolk. Two others were injured. Then-Police Chief Larry Boone said the shooting reportedly stemmed from an argument</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/24/we-must-do-something-to-stem-this-wanton-bloodshed/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over a spilled drink inside the restaurant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Jenkins was caught in the crossfire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia does have resources currently for victims of violence. In December, for example, the Criminal Justice Services Board</span> <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/december/name-945502-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved $20 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for several police- and victim-related efforts, Porter said. The money included $5 million for a program to provide services to victims of violent crime in hospitals, with the goal of reducing future violence-related injuries and homicides.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed “mass violence” fund would help people impacted by large-scale shootings and other crimes. Victims and families from the</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/02/virginias-largest-city-joins-an-ever-expanding-grisly-list/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 rampage at the Virginia Beach Municipal Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for instance, would be among the first to likely qualify for reimbursements.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pray the proposed fund, because of possible future carnage, will never be needed.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll despair when such violence eventually happens.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State election officials should thank Stephanie Iles, Norfolk’s general registrar and director of elections. She helped uncover a</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-officials-say-more-than-10500-felons-remained-on-voter-rolls-after-re-offending/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">computer glitch that allowed more than 10,000 felons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to stay on voter rolls after they were convicted of new crimes making them ineligible – again – to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact state officials were unaware of the problem </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for more than a decade</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should guide Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares in how strongly he pursues prosecution. The 10,558 people who remained on the rolls – only about 1,000 of whom actually voted – is a small subset of the hundreds of thousands who had their voting and other civil rights restored by recent governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ stance should be one of reason and compassion. Many who cast ballots probably thought they had that privilege.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, no one in charge had alerted them otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Iles told me, she had noticed Norfolk residents with felony convictions had applied to vote. They should’ve been knocked off the rolls of acceptable applicants, but they hadn’t been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I actually spoke with the commissioner about it,” Iles said, referring to Susan Beals, state Department of Elections commissioner. Agency spokespeople confirmed to me Iles had alerted Beals about the glitch and was the first local registrar to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my colleague Graham Moomaw reported recently, the state’s voter system wasn’t set up to accont for the possibility newly registered voters might re-offend and become ineligible again. “ELECT has automated a solution to cancel these voters and add them back to the prohibited list,” the agency said in a</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/news-releases/elect-conducts-review-of-voter-roll-list-maintenance-practices.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dec. 9 news release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem had existed since at least 2011, officials told Moomaw. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact the possible data flaw wasn’t envisioned seems unbelievable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has remained among the states with the lowest recidivism rates nationwide. That figure, though, most recently was 22.3%,</span><a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/news-press-releases/2021/virginia-s-recidivism-rate-remains-among-the-lowest-in-the-country/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">state corrections department official told me Wednesday. So it stands to reason some people who got back on voter rolls would re-offend eventually. (Recidivism refers to re-incarceration of state-responsible inmates within three years of their release.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The programming was quite faulty,” Jesse Richman, associate professor of political science and international studies at Old Dominion University, said about the glitch involving felons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor is this the first time the state’s aging voter system has come under scrutiny recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elections department had problems earlier in 2022 processing voter registration data from the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles. Local election officials had to process more than 250,000 transactions that hadn’t been properly transferred just before the midterms in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not the way to endear your agency to localities around the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state elections official told me the new voter system, which should take care of the technological shortcomings, should be up and running in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of this should cast doubt on the hundreds of thousands of people who have had their rights restored in Virginia. Many have gone on to vote legally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state remains</span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-rights-restoration-efforts-virginia" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the most punitive nationwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for released felons who want to vote again. They have to petition the governor for restoration instead of gaining it automatically, as in many other places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process has become simpler since the term of Gov. Bob McDonnell. His successors, Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, restored rights to</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/20/youngkin-virginia-restoration-felon-rights/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">roughly 284,000 former prisoners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia could end the stench of racial bias that hangs around</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_23caa5bd-c765-5102-8a6f-80c6bb6aca1e.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">felon disenfranchisement, which dates to at least the early 1900s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Along with literacy tests and poll taxes, bans on felon voting prevented African Americans from casting ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all could’ve changed the clause in the Virginia Constitution involving felon voting. But the House of Delegates, now under Republican control,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/va-house-republicans-kill-felon-voting-rights-proposal-despite-bipartisan-support/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this year struck down the necessary second vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to amend the document.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which brings me back to Miyares. Will his much ballyhooed</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/miyares-integrity-unit-is-sop-to-election-deniers/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(and totally unnecessary)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “election integrity unit” go after the 1,000 people who had gotten their rights back, committed a new felony and voted illegally – though probably unaware they were wrong in doing so?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, our unit is involved,” his spokeswoman, Victoria LaCivita, told me by email. She said she couldn’t comment further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My unsolicited advice? Punt on the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first place, the fact these individuals weren’t behind bars and could vote means they probably weren’t guilty of a serious felony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor is this worth tying up the unit’s attorneys and the courts. Or saddling onetime felons with yet another crime – when local and state elections officials didn’t even bar them from voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s smarter to streamline the restoration process even further. Maybe then, the state won’t have to double-check its computer programming.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider all the ways police departments around Virginia are working to fill vacancies in their ranks: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offering signing bonuses. Boosting salaries. Attending military, community and college career fairs. Making it simpler for service members to transition from their military branch to patrol cars. Hyping careers in law enforcement on social media platforms. Recruiting outside their immediate metropolitan areas.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so on, according to department officials who I interviewed this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yawning gaps persist, however, for many agencies –</span> <a href="https://www.policeforum.org/workforcesurveyjune2021" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially the larger ones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Norfolk Police Department spokesman told me the agency has 205 openings among its 733 authorized sworn officer positions – or 28% of the force.</span> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/02/fairfax-county-police-officer-shortage/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has roughly 190 vacancies for a force of 1,600, nearly 12%. Richmond reported</span> <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/richmond-police-chief-responds-to-recent-shootings-involving-young-people/article_64376417-41c9-5f27-815c-e0782747b450.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 150 police vacancies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in October; I couldn’t get an update this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruitment of minority officers has been challenging for years,</span> <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_4fecb3cf-6078-52a9-b788-2b26d9840e8e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as I’ve previously written</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortfalls among officers of all races existed even before the pandemic began in early 2020 and the videotaped police killing of George Floyd happened that spring. Both of those factors, though, contributed to the current crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police officers also face unprecedented scrutiny since the advent of cellphone cameras, though that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Wrongdoing has come to light because</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/us/south-carolina-officer-is-charged-with-murder-in-black-mans-death.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of videotaped footage from citizens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/02/fairfax-county-police-officer-shortage/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported Fairfax County police leaders are hoping a public safety cadet program will, eventually, help stem shortfalls there. The program provides leadership and career training for high school students and other young adults ages 14 to 21 who are interested in law enforcement.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such policing shortages pose threats for cities and counties. They reduce the ability of officers to patrol neighborhoods and respond quickly to robberies, shootings and other serious crimes. They make it tougher to investigate incidents and do proactive community policing.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a nationwide problem,” Chuck Wexler, executive director of the</span><a href="https://www.policeforum.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Police Executive Research Forum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Washington-based think tank, told me Wednesday.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example,</span><a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/spd-warns-of-staffing-crisis-after-66-more-officers-leave/281-040a65b1-3165-4f24-8652-a5d10860aac7" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lost 180 officers in 2020 and dozens more by mid-2021. The department reported a</span><a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/mayor-bruce-harrell-new-seattle-police-recruitment-plan-staffing-reaches-30-year-low/281-e98429ee-fc88-47f6-8890-b961393e2047" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">30-year low</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the number of officers in 2022, partly because of retirements and resignations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The No. 1 issue in policing right now is staffing,” Wexler said, adding that departments compete with each other for a limited number of candidates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the quest to fill vacancies, though, departments shouldn’t skimp on completing background checks and psychological tests of applicants. There can be no shortcuts. Police officers wield tremendous power over citizens, and they should pass the requisite evaluations of fitness and judgment before hitting the streets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also must uphold the law while not exhibiting bias toward people simply because of their race, sexual orientation or the neighborhood they live in.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor should they risk sedition or treason because they believe – falsely – an election went to the wrong guy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the more alarming developments following the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, was the involvement of police officers and military personnel in the mob. Some of those officers hailed from the commonwealth;</span> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/08/16/fracker-robertson-capitol-cop/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least two were convicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their actions that day. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/09/965472049/the-capitol-siege-the-arrested-and-their-stories" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR, which tracks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criminal cases related to the Capitol attack, says more than 900 people have been charged so far. It reports that at least 14% of those charged appear “to have ties to the military or to law enforcement.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An American Civil Liberties Union official noted extremism among people who carry a gun and a badge threatens police agencies and residents. Rachel Grinspan, director of law enforcement policy and civil rights for the Anti-Defamation League,</span><a href="https://www.policechiefmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/PoliceChief-July2022_WEB.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “It is critical to ensure that law enforcement officers are prepared and willing to serve and protect </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in their communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The actions of one individual can erode community trust and tarnish the reputation of an entire department,” Grinspan said in Police Chief magazine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overwhelming majority of police officers want to serve their citizens and lock up the bad guys. They make life-and-death decisions. They want to get home safely at night. They know they’re under a microscope, from politicians and residents alike.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of those factors make it difficult for departments to recruit nowadays. No question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rushing the process, though, would make a tough situation even worse. The people on patrol must want to be there, uphold the law and treat residents with respect.  </span></p>

(SDI Productions/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state Attorney General’s Office doth protest too much.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victoria LaCivita, spokeswoman for Attorney General Jason Miyares, says the Virginia NAACP owes the office’s lawyers and other employees</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/29/after-9-5k-foia-bill-naacp-releases-records-on-virginias-election-integrity-unit/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“an apology”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for reputedly “groundless attacks” about starting a 20-person election integrity unit to root out voting irregularities.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and Miyares shouldn’t hold their breaths. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NAACP blasted the unit at a news conference this week after obtaining documents about it under the Freedom of Information Act. The integrity unit is “a public relations ploy to pander to election deniers and conspiracy theorists, who are the real force undermining public confidence in our elections,” said NAACP Virginia President Robert N. Barnette Jr.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and other critics are right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Context here is essential:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares created the office </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">after </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurrectionists had attacked the U.S. Capitol in early 2021 while attempting to overturn the presidential election results. Donald Trump had incited his supporters after repeatedly lying about Joe Biden’s victory.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-voting-rights-florida-georgia-4db14ddccf37e4597cb9b7f20ec499b4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is one of three states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that created special units after the 2020 election, all involving </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican governors, attorneys general or legislatures. Their “discoveries” of wrongdoing have been negligible – especially given the total number of ballots cast. They haven’t uncovered systemic problems, the Associated Press reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a 2021 state audit in Virginia</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/03/31/audit-overwhelmingly-confirms-virginias-election-results/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">verified Biden’s comfortable win</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the commonwealth. Similarly, an</span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/elections/audit-results-2021-virginia-election/291-e1964eb2-1edf-4fff-a668-9b09a8b3f656" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">audit this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found the 2021 statewide results – in which Miyares and other Republicans won – accurate, too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state unit is prosecuting a former top election official in Prince William County over</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/07/top-prince-william-election-official-says-hes-quitting-amid-dispute-with-local-gop/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">misconduct allegations.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But its creation is overblown given the lack of electoral problems in Virginia.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The unit was both a restructuring of resources already existing in the office,” LaCivita told me by email Thursday, “and a fulfillment of a campaign promise, because Virginians expressed concerns to him about our elections as he traveled across the Commonwealth.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those concerns are irrational, though, should they be indulged? Isn’t it better to proclaim the system’s reliability and accuracy, as obviously is the case?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True, the AG’s office has often noted Virginia’s election system is strong – as Miyares wrote in a</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/19/jason-miyares-election-integrity-unit-virginia-fair-elections/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in October. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no widespread voter fraud in Virginia or elsewhere in the country,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too bad the attorney general neglected to say that in</span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2452-september-9-2022-attorney-general-miyares-announces-new-election-integrity-unit" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Sept. 9 announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the unit’s start. The omission was glaring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what other units will his office create when there’s scant evidence of wrongdoing? Miyares “believes in being proactive, rather than reactive,” LaCivita wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That tack strains credulity. You don’t investigate a nonexistent problem – unless you’re politicizing it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is pandering to a populace that’s disinclined to listen to facts. This sop to election deniers harms democracy and undermines election workers. The unit should be disbanded. </span></p>

(Roger Chesley / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers and policymakers know the ways to reduce gun violence and needless murders across the country. They include</span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/disarm-domestic-abusers/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">disarming domestic abusers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, banning so-called</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/06/02/gun-control-solutions-that-work/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“weapons of war”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allow attackers to keep firing without reloading and requiring background checks</span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/require-background-checks-gun-sales/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">for all gun sales</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studies and reporting from The Washington Post, the Center for American Progress and think tanks provide these directives.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will our politicians answer, in the wake of the ghastly execution</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/walmart-shooting-chesapeake-virginia-b52927596381aa65efed367ce0c81c83" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of six Walmart workers in Chesapeake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by an angry colleague last week, before he killed himself? Or will the people in power continue to do nothing? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I live roughly five miles from that Chesapeake store. Besides those killed, other workers were wounded.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I toured the parking lot memorial to the slain employees, interviewed people paying respects and attended a Monday night vigil featuring Gov. Glenn Youngkin, I became part of an all-too-familiar, depressing loop:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mass shooting occurs. Journalists descend. People who knew the suspect weigh in, sometimes expressing shock. Relatives of the victims grieve. Progressives demand restrictions on gun access. Conservatives answer with some variable of “now is not the time” to discuss guns (</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/23/after-chesapeake-uva-shootings-youngkin-to-propose-mental-health-agenda/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">see Youngkin’s response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week, as if from a script). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtually nothing changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And repeat &#8230; with another mass shooting elsewhere in America only days later. That doesn’t include the daily carnage that claims one or two lives at a time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aren’t we weary of this? Why is the status quo acceptable when no other </span><a href="https://www.healthdata.org/acting-data/gun-violence-united-states-outlier" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">industrialized, wealthy nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shares such constant bloodshed?  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin comforted hundreds gathered at Chesapeake City Park on Monday evening, combining words from Scriptures with messages of hope for the future. His appearance, in that regard, was welcome. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must mend our wounds of grief,” the governor said, “with an unyielding determination to change the conditions of our society that have increasingly bred a culture of despair, of disillusion and a lack of respect for human life.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, however, wouldn’t even use the words “guns,” “firearms” or “large-capacity magazines” in explaining why he journeyed from Richmond to the commonwealth’s second-largest city. What happened in Chesapeake wasn’t an accident; it was gun-fueled murder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the Republican guv readily cited mental illness as a contributing factor, as if it were divorced from the tool that had left families in mourning. “I’m not alone,” he said, “in concluding that we have a mental health and a behavioral health crisis in the United States and in Virginia.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a cop-out. “Mental illness” has become the default GOP explanation when a mass shooting happens – even though it was associated with just</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318286/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">5% of gun-related homicides between 2001 and 2010,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to a 2015 study.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chesapeake massacre occurred less than two weeks after authorities said</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/23/after-chesapeake-uva-shootings-youngkin-to-propose-mental-health-agenda/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a University of Virginia student fatally shot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> three football players in Charlottesville and wounded two others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Carol Kegg was among those paying respects at the Walmart parking lot in Chesapeake. “It’s just heartbreaking,” the 68-year-old mother and grandmother told me.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kegg, like others I interviewed, was especially saddened by the death of employee </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernando Chavez-Barron, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 16-year-old who was the youngest murder victim.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the vigil, a Chesapeake city councilman said Fernando had been a good student who loved to read. The teen had started working to “lessen the burden for his family.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Walmart employee who narrowly escaped injury filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the company, saying Walmart </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ignored her complaints about the shooter’s alarming behavior,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-walmart-shooting-lawsuit-20221129-5s3kigtofrdqngsdfdwetixchu-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginian-Pilot reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Andre Bing, the 31-year-old shooter, had asked the plaintiff whether she liked guns and told store employees and managers if he was fired he would retaliate, according to the suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wrote previously Virginia has taken some steps to fight back. For example, the General Assembly passed</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/13/what-virginia-changed-since-the-last-high-profile-school-shooting/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a red-flag law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to temporarily seize guns from people believed to pose a threat to themselves or others, and it restarted a limit on buying one handgun a month.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the changes occurred when Democrats controlled both chambers and held the governor’s seat. That’s not the case now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s obvious state and federal leaders could do more. The recommended steps won’t eliminate gun crimes and slayings, especially when</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/24/we-must-do-something-to-stem-this-wanton-bloodshed/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans own an estimated 400 million firearms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Any measurable drop in deaths and injuries, though, would be a plus because more people – and their loved ones – would be spared. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prescriptions (many of them national) are multifaceted. Of the ones I didn’t mention earlier, they include holding gun dealers more accountable for the firearms they sell; implementing waiting periods for purchases, which seem</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to lower suicides; and supporting local</span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/support-local-violence-prevention-intervention-programs/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">violence intervention programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We could also do what the</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/11/25/gun-rights-test-czech-republic/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Czech Republic has done</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: It forces residents to show their competence before they can own a gun, as The Washington Post reported. They must pass a multiple-choice test and demonstrate they can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">handle a weapon safely and shoot accurately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that’s not likely to fly in this independent-minded nation. How dare I suggest training before picking up a tool designed to kill or maim. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should be open, however, to altering mindsets. Too many people have lost too much. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 45,000 people died</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by gunfire last year, the bulk of them suicides. That’s about equal to every man, woman and child in Blacksburg.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the numbers are added up for 2022, they’ll include the employees who died at Walmart just days before Thanksgiving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do right by them – and thousands of others. Let’s end this madness. </span></p>

(Courtesy of Rebecca Muir)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers go to great lengths – and even heights – to provide the best learning environments for their children. Sometimes literally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s praise Rebecca Muir, a Georgetown Primary School third-grade teacher in Chesapeake, for combining education and skydiving to pique her students’ interest. We have</span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjCvaGfdURA&amp;t=13s" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">YouTube</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Facebook to prove this daredevil inspires you to look up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muir tops my list of things I’m thankful for in Virginia,</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/24/virginia-theres-lots-of-people-to-be-thankful-for-this-year/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my annual collection of items</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that I hope make you smile, appreciate our commonwealth even more and spotlight events overlooked during the rush of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The entertaining educator filmed herself reading the book, “A Letter from Your Teacher,” a rhyming welcome note to her students before the school year started. She jumped out of a small plane at 13,000 feet, pulled her parachute and used a GoPro 360 with a chest mount to film the recitation.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her “wow” factor is off the charts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m very passionate about teaching and very passionate about skydiving,” Muir told me last week. “I just wanted to start the school year off getting them excited.” She’s made similar welcome messages since the pandemic started, but this was the first time she took to the skies for one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muir, 29, says parents and fellow teachers were in disbelief after watching the video, but students thought it was cool: “I’ve got street cred with them!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve got that right. In the video, the licensed skydiver with 350 jumps exudes enthusiasm and confidence as she glides to earth. After donning sunglasses, her toughest task seemed to be preventing the book from whooshing out of her hands.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People just appreciated it was positive, light and airy,” Muir said.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What will she do for an encore next year? “I don’t know!” Muir chuckled. “I’ve been thinking about that. Maybe solving a math problem and taking a whiteboard.” </span></p>
<p><b>While Muir gets folks to look up</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one man prefers looking down –</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/25/one-man-has-collected-more-than-8000-pounds-of-acorns-for-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">where the acorns fall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mercury colleague Meghan McIntyre wrote about Mike Ortmeier’s continuing efforts to scoop up acorns near his Arlington home. He then turns them over to the state. The volunteer has collected more than 8,000 pounds of acorns over the past 13 years.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forestry officials plant acorns and nuts at state-run nurseries to grow into seedlings that are then transplanted around the commonwealth. As one conservancy official noted: “What we are really looking for is more Mikes.” </span></p>
<p><b>Sportsmanship </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">at all levels was once routine. However, at a time when</span> <a href="https://www.wafb.com/2022/05/24/i-thought-he-died-referee-attacked-by-coach-son-after-recreational-basketball-game/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">referees are attacked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2020/03/02/overzealous-parents-are-ruining-youth-sports-heres-how-do-better/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">parents go overboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or athletes behave badly, you wonder whether basic decency by players has become passé. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it took a simple act by Eric Fila, a catcher in a Virginia high school baseball playoff, to remind everyone that it’s still a game, and we should adhere to standards – win or lose. The West Springfield player’s team had just given up the winning hit. Eric removed his catcher’s mask, turned toward the home plate umpire and extended his hand. Shortly after, the ump shook hands with him.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/06/15/west-springfield-virginia-catcher/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video went viral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but Eric, a rising senior at the time, thought the reaction was overblown. “It’s something so simple,” he told The Washington Post.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be, Eric. Thank you for reminding us. </span></p>
<p><b>Get out your hankies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If any story this year could make you boo-hoo, it’s one about the bonds between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julia Prendergast and Tyme Fiedorczyk, who have been friends for 15 years.</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/life/vp-db-julia-tyme-080722-20220807-mq2oyiyzuncs5ifc3pt2mw6s5u-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginian-Pilot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrote about the relationship of the two 20-somethings. Fiedorczyk has cerebral palsy; Prendergast is her full-time caregiver.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ve shared movie nights, shopping trips and birthday parties. And much more. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I decided I would be with her every day,” Prendergast said during an interview at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiedorczyk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s home in Chesapeake. “And I told her to get used to it.”  </span></p>
<p><b>On the gift-giving front</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he</span> <a href="https://vmfa.museum/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Museum of Fine Arts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced it had received a nearly $60 million gift. That’s right, eight figures. The gift included</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/entertainment/arts/vp-nw-art-museum-gift-20220316-xrcraqf5m5bntiiyojxi4rlskq-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a major contribution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Richmond museum’s expansion campaign and paintings by prominent American artists.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>
<p><b>When thinking about staying healthy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/08/more-smiles-more-health-more-life/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oral care is often overlooked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. People forced to choose between a doctor’s office and a dental chair usually opt for the former.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it was great news the</span> <a href="https://heraldcourier.com/news/650-000-in-donations-to-double-abingdon-dental-clinics-capacity/article_342d19d0-1277-11ed-920e-7fa9055c8d85.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Highlands Community Dental Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Abingdon announced plans to expand following $650,000 in donations. The nonprofit says it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">provides oral care to the uninsured and adults in recovery programs in Southwest Virginia. The center said it treated </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 3,600 patients in 2021.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Was it God?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kismet? Extreme luck? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps some combination kept</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/health/vp-nw-croatan-rescue-1015-20221016-3fvbxxzmgrfwxawtlduu6icv5u-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">59-year-old Todd Rowan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> alive early last month after he suffered a heart attack on the sand in Virginia Beach. Fortunately for him, a pair of surfers – one a physician’s assistant, the other a health care worker at a local hospital – and other onlookers tended to Rowan. They did CPR, helping him to survive until paramedics arrived.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paramedics used a defibrillator to shock Rowan back to consciousness. They took him to a hospital, and Rowan later had quadruple bypass heart surgery.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much could’ve altered the outcome. Rowan and his wife were set to drive back to New Jersey that day, but they decided to walk on the beach first. One of the rescuers stayed out longer on the waves than he’d originally planned. I couldn’t reach the Rowans, but one thing’s for certain: This Thanksgiving for them will be unlike any other.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">May yours be special, too. </span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GA-2020-1024x683.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GA-2020-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GA-2020-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GA-2020-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GA-2020-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/GA-2020-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">The 2020 Virginia General Assembly. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s income tax brackets have always shocked me, especially because of their glaring lack of fairness.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was a newspaper columnist in South Hampton Roads, I eventually earned in the upper five figures annually. That placed me into the same category as someone who made just over $17,000 a year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We both paid an income tax rate of 5.75%.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That dichotomy was crazy. It didn’t represent even a whiff of equity. The brackets are based on taxable income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why didn’t I shoulder a heavier burden? Why didn’t folks earning much less keep more of their desperately needed cash – and render unto Caesar a smaller percentage?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bring this up because the state’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission released</span><a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt564-1.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently about making the income tax system fairer – and saner. My Virginia Mercury colleague</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/04/virginias-highest-tax-bracket-starts-at-17k-some-say-its-time-for-an-update/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graham Moomaw reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the antiquated brackets and JLARC’s recommendations to the General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Assembly directed JLARC to study increasing the “progressivity” of the individual income tax system. That means taxing people according to their ability to pay, instead of setting the same tax rates for the rich and the poor or taxing the poor disproportionately.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Income taxes account for 70% of the state’s general fund revenue, so they’re the main source for spending.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report noted the Assembly, thankfully, already had changed two components of income tax this year to make it more progressive. The legislature nearly doubled the standard deduction, and it made the state earned income tax credit partly refundable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is the Assembly hasn’t altered the state’s four tax brackets since 1990. That practically begs claims of neglect against our legislators.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s median income has risen 108% since then, “but income taxes owed by a single filer with median income increased 173%,” JLARC said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a minimum, the state could update the tax brackets to account for inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third-highest bracket now, for instance, covers folks earning just $5,001 to $17,000, and the highest has everybody above $17,000. Why someone earning six or seven figures annually is lumped in with a person making less than even $20,000 is mind-boggling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thirty-two years ago, you were considered rich at $17,000 and hit the top tax bracket,” a delegate said earlier this year at a legislative hearing.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">anywhere </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in America in 1990 that $17,000 was considered “rich” – especially not in Northern Virginia or Hampton Roads. That certainly wasn’t the case in Detroit, either, where I was living at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comments like the delegate’s make me ponder about the discernment process of the Honorables in Richmond. But I digress. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s been pushback from parts of the state Capitol on some of JLARC’s proposals, including possibly raising taxes on the rich. The report says that move would increase progressivity and state revenue, but Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the GOP-controlled House of Delegates prefer broad tax cuts (of course) rather than tax increases.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and other pro-business leaders</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/expect-plenty-of-talk-on-taxes-but-no-overhaul-of-va-s-outdated-code/article_4e2182d9-49f1-581a-ad84-9cd97d192abe.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">say lower taxes would help the commonwealth compete with North Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other Southern states. They should be careful not to ignite a race to the bottom, where the quality of life could suffer just to lure companies to relocate here.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state already approved</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/21/youngkin-ceremonially-signs-virginia-budget-while-calling-for-more-tax-relief/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$4 billion in tax cuts this year,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> though Youngkin wanted to go further. Before making additional tax cuts, legislators should tell Virginians exactly how they would deal with the reduced revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s dismal performance in fully funding its own Standards of Quality, for example, is a sore spot with educators and localities.</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/12/virginia-lags-many-states-in-state-education-funding-analysis-says/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a perennial problem.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia also ranks 41st in state per-pupil spending, according to an analysis</span><a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/the-half-sheet/high-capacity-low-effort-virginias-school-funding-is-low-compared-to-most-rich-states/?emci=f738fc88-1e10-ec11-981f-501ac57ba3ed&amp;emdi=aa431e7d-ad10-ec11-981f-501ac57ba3ed&amp;ceid=744714" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released in 2021.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s legislators should create tax brackets that account for the inflation that’s occurred over the past few decades. Six brackets, instead of four, should be debated. A 10% rate for the state’s millionaires must not be out of the question, either.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the Assembly shouldn’t do is continue to treat someone on the low end of the income scale like someone making tens of thousands more. That’s indefensible. </span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Republican officials around the country, including at least two in Virginia, are now saying publicly the party should cut ties with or disavow Donald Trump, the former president and de facto boss of the GOP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hooray for this “come to Jesus” moment.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/10/virginia-winsome-sears-trump/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/09/why-a-firebrand-virginia-republican-says-its-time-to-divorce-trump/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Tim Anderson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Virginia Beach assailed Trump’s influence after their party’s lackluster performance in last week’s midterm congressional elections. (Earle-Sears and Anderson won their current seats last year.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just don’t kid yourselves about why some GOP leaders – finally – want a divorce from Trump. It’s not because of some newly found valor. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Au contraire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather, they fear Trump will drag the party down further as he continues to influence the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">entire </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">electorate – not just his sycophants. He already was an albatross for Republican candidates in the 2017 and 2019 General Assembly elections here in Virginia.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/13/1136103595/the-midterms-didnt-produce-a-wave-heres-what-thats-meant-historically" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite midterm results that historically favor the party not in the White House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the U.S. Senate will remain in Democratic Party control.</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2022-election-results-house-races-democrats-majority/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The House of Representatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won’t have a huge Republican majority, if at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Republicans who recently criticized Trump – or urged him to delay announcing a 2024 White House bid until after the Senate runoff in Georgia – include</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/11/trump-criticism-midterms-republicans/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Lawler, who won a U.S. House seat in New York state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plenty of opportunities to repudiate Trump for his unhinged, racist and anti-democratic comments arose before. GOP elected officials usually remained silent, either because they didn’t want to risk alienating the base, or wholeheartedly supported the former president.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a refresher:</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/11/politics/immigrants-shithole-countries-trump" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shithole countries.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Hyperbole and mischaracterization about his record involving</span><a href="https://www.vox.com/21524499/what-trump-has-done-for-black-people" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Withholding aid and support to</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/12/768935251/trump-ukraine-and-the-path-to-the-impeachment-inquiry-a-timeline" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ukraine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unless it agreed to investigate developments that could damage Joe Biden – leading to Trump’s first impeachment.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there’s his botched handling of the pandemic,</span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-downplaying-virus-mocked-wearing-masks-months/story?id=73392694" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">including mocking the wearing of masks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-atlantic-military-reaction/2020/09/04/b0fe0690-eec0-11ea-a21a-0fbbe90cfd8c_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disparaging U.S. service members killed in combat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though he</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-vietnam-draft-exemption.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">avoided serving in Vietnam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at all costs. Inciting the insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. Capitol following his repeated lies about the 2020 election being stolen.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-atlantic-military-reaction/2020/09/04/b0fe0690-eec0-11ea-a21a-0fbbe90cfd8c_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans repeatedly gave Trump a pass, one that went beyond the usual partisan politics. That stance has been an affront to democracy and common decency. Many Republicans continue to be his apologists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump deserves the intraparty criticism, but it should’ve happened years ago. There’s nothing courageous about it now. </span></p>

So unnecessary.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so past time for Gov. Glenn Youngkin to shut down his teacher snitch line. His spokeswoman, Macaulay Porter, confirmed to me the euphemistically named “help education email” was deactivated in September, eight months after Youngkin announced its start.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acknowledgment finally came after</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/03/youngkin-school-tip-line-emails" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios reported last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that emails it sent to the tip line address bounced back as undeliverable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porter, as she does repeatedly, wouldn’t answer my specific questions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to know the number of emails the administration had received overall, how effective the comments were in providing guidance and why she hadn’t responded to my request Oct. 19 about whether the email address still worked.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d asked because the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/20/collaboration-instead-of-lower-standards-is-a-better-fix-for-teacher-shortages/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">administration has lowered the bar for teacher licensure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ease a shortage in K-12 public schools. I wrote last month the snitch line, however, evoked the worst tactics in communist countries, whereby neighbors spied on neighbors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ending the unseemly practice could help fill vacancies, after all.</span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brown-center-chalkboard/2022/08/26/are-we-at-a-crisis-point-with-the-public-teacher-workforce-education-scholars-share-their-perspectives/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Teacher shortages have been the norm nationwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially during the pandemic.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s stupefying, though, to penalize educators by having them face undue scrutiny on the one hand and then begging them to flock to Virginia on the other – at the urging of the chief executive, no less. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talk about chutzpah. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had proudly announced the reporting mechanism in January just days after he was inaugurated. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The email address was “for parents to send us any instances where they feel that their fundamental rights are being violated, where their children are not being respected, where there are inherently divisive practices in their schools,”</span><a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/01/25/gov-youngkin-sets-up-tip-line-report-divisive-teaching-practices/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">he said in a radio interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor was this teacher-targeted denunciation the guv’s lone attack on the profession.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin won the governor’s contest last year</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-education-parental-rights-school-curricula-604edece27a483155c409187f258a058" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by playing up parental rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and demonizing critical race theory – even though the latter isn’t taught in K-12 public schools. So naturally, he signed an</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on his first day in office “to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">end the use of inherently divisive concepts,” including CRT.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Note to Youngkin and other conservatives: Please stop cherry-picking Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s oratory, as the guv did in the order. Your actions contradict King’s work and activism – for which he was assassinated.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s easy to halt something that’s not happening, while still throwing red meat to your base. The executive order had the effect of</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/28/why-the-furor-over-critical-race-theory-misses-the-point/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">preventing a fuller telling of U.S. history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with all its warts, violence and white supremacy – even though Youngkin claimed otherwise.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Fedderman, president of the Virginia Education Association, told me the snitch line was “just another tactic in the ongoing attempt to be divisive.” The major goal, he added, should be for the administration to work with the community and parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fedderman said the governor’s true motivation has been “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to get parents to think the only way to address these issues is with charter schools and lab schools, and it’s not.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s telling the administration has refused to release the total number of missives it received by email, as well as characterize the overall tenor. That suggests many of the comments were benign or even laudatory of educators in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in January,</span><a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/01/25/gov-youngkin-sets-up-tip-line-report-divisive-teaching-practices/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">people like entertainer John Legend, the Loudoun County NAACP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others asked Black parents to email their concerns and flood the snitch line with useless info. “Saturday Night Live” spoofed it.</span><a href="https://twitter.com/Knott_Katherine/status/1489262447693164546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1489262447693164546%7Ctwgr%5Ee4259ed6fcaead86543670e3c3a34a5b2ab58d39%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motherjones.com%2Fpolitics%2F2022%2F02%2Fglenn-youngkin-virginia-tip-line-crt-teachers%2F" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Groups representing educators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> asked Youngkin to immediately shut down the line. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/03/youngkin-education-tip-line-emails/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the comments were duplicates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One high school senior complained about the way a teacher focused on “Beowulf.” One woman praised physical education teachers around the commonwealth. A parent criticized a reading assignment “sympathetic” to immigrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, the horror. Let’s not make immigrants seem human. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/07/virginia-report-shows-more-teachers-leaving-the-workforce-than-entering-it/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mercury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted the state has more teachers leaving the workforce than newly licensed teachers entering it. The Mercury cited a report from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration’s snitch line couldn’t have helped that situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You wonder why Youngkin </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">started this Orwellian device against teachers. Was it a sop to his disciples? Was it to establish conservative bona fides as he sets himself up for national office?  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jettisoning the snitch line was overdue. But the issue sent an ominous message to educators around Virginia: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re under the microscope. And this guv won’t hesitate using you as political pawns. </span></p>

That’s what I tallied on the SATs more than 40 years ago while attending my college prep high school in Washington, D.C. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprisingly, I did better on the math portion, getting 600, but I earned just 480 on the English section. My coursework had revealed the exact opposite: I struggled in algebra and calculus, yet I aced literature and composition assignments with ease.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This stroll down test-taking lane – “bring at least two No. 2 pencils and get a good night’s sleep beforehand” – comes courtesy of</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/31/more-virginia-colleges-make-sat-act-exams-optional/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent article in the Virginia Mercury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by my colleague Nathaniel Cline.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reported that dozens of colleges in the state, including the University of Virginia, Norfolk State and Virginia Tech, have relaxed admissions exam requirements. More than 1,800 accredited four-year colleges and universities nationwide will offer ACT/SAT-optional or test-free policies for fall 2023 applicants. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kVc27xYVTy"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/31/more-virginia-colleges-make-sat-act-exams-optional/">More Virginia colleges make SAT, ACT exams optional</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;More Virginia colleges make SAT, ACT exams optional&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/31/more-virginia-colleges-make-sat-act-exams-optional/embed/#?secret=lRX2L2XMhp#?secret=kVc27xYVTy" data-secret="kVc27xYVTy" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shift will draw even more scrutiny to the lucrative testing juggernaut that has ruled the college admissions process for decades and struck so much fear, second-guessing and nausea in high school juniors and seniors. The standardized exams – I took both in high school – didn&#8217;t freak me out, though they wreaked havoc with some of my friends.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A James Madison University admissions official told Cline that instead of standardized test scores, grades in core courses were more relevant for identifying potential academic success. De-emphasizing the tests will force colleges to look more closely at a student’s entire body of work in high school, including class selection and grades, extracurriculars and community service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a worthwhile switch.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve had an increase in the underrepresented populations,” including low-income and Pell Grant-eligible students, Donna Harper, vice p</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resident of access and enrollment management at JMU, told me Wednesday. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest thing for us was attempting to provide better access.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might be tougher for higher ed to discern who to admit, but in the long run the change to optional testing is better for both students and colleges. The former won’t be rejected so easily. The latter, by doing the hard work at the start, will probably gain a better indication of who will fare well.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The not-for-profit College Board, which</span><a href="https://marker.medium.com/a-slippery-slope-for-big-test-cf3f6f64e28b" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has reported more than $1 billion annually in revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, produces the test. I doubt the board or the</span><a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/tutoring-test-preparation-franchises-united-states/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $1 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">billion-plus industry of testing prep</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will go quietly, though. There’s just too much cash involved.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board, by the way,</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/sat-essay-subject-tests.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">also produces Advanced Placement tests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So it’s still trying to safeguard a chunk of the revenue stream. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/sats/where/history.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SATs started in 1926</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a college admissions test for a few thousand applicants. The exam has led to controversy, criticism and plenty of study in the nearly 100 years since it began.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the name’s been contentious: It originally was called the Scholastic Aptitude Test, and the idea it was a test of intelligence backed a theory “there was a strong connection between intelligence and race,” as</span><a href="https://www.manhattanreview.com/sat-history/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">one test history noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Name changes have continued.</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/sat-essay-subject-tests.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A required essay section started in 2005</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but later became optional.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/race-gaps-in-sat-scores-highlight-inequality-and-hinder-upward-mobility/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racial gaps in the scores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have persisted over time, and critics have said the test is culturally biased. The test scores are a key indicator, as</span><a href="https://www.jbhe.com/features/49_college_admissions-test.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> previously noted, of the disparities in school districts that predominantly Black and brown students usually attend and those attended by white and Asian students.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Public schools in many neighborhoods with large black populations are underfunded, inadequately staffed, and ill equipped to provide the same quality of secondary education that is offered in predominantly white suburban school districts,” the journal said in 2005.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, test scores were more a result of the everyday school challenges certain students faced than of any innate ability.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also the disposable income families need to take test prep classes. Obviously, the higher the income, the more likely parents can afford to enroll their children in courses or one-on-one tutoring. Test prep can cost thousands of dollars,</span><a href="https://tower.mastersny.org/4900/features/privilege-sat/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">news articles note</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tests themselves have fees, too, though students might be eligible for waivers. The</span><a href="https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/registration/fees-refunds/test-fees" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">SAT costs $60</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year, for example.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My wife and I, first-generation college students in our families, knew it was important for our three children to do well on the SATs. Because we could pay, we had each take the test several times, beginning in middle school.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I vividly remember leaving Roger Jr. at the testing site when he was in the seventh grade, and how the other students dwarfed him in size. One curious guy asked how old he was.)  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/00028312211003526" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study released last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that at 100 private colleges, test-optional policies were connected with a 3 to 4% increase in admissions of Pell Grant recipients and a 10 to 12% increase in first-time Black, Latinx and Native American students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine what juniors and seniors could do by not having to focus on the SATs. They could use that time on current classes. Or completing community service. Maybe there’s an extracurricular they could fit in.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents, meanwhile, could keep a little more money in their pockets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of those are good reasons to ditch the SATs. Sorry, College Board. </span></p>

(Photo by Rob Carr / Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington’s NFL franchise – beset by</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/washington-commanders-nfl-sports-business-football-3777ecab91f68e3fbbb0c1f62db8d088" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">investigations against the owner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, complaints of a toxic culture in the front office and constant mediocrity on the field – wrote a bounced check for a 50-50 raffle it sponsored</span><a href="https://www.commanders.com/community/5050-raffle" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to support its charitable foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a perfect metaphor for the Washington Commanders (former name a slur) under the incompetent stewardship of Daniel Snyder. As a native Washingtonian, I’ve rooted for the once-proud team for more than half a century. That devotion has become tepid since Snyder bought the franchise in 1999.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drew Shipley, a season ticket holder, won a 50-50 raffle in September, only to learn later that the</span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/commanders-5050-raffle-winner-says-teams-check-bounced-after-he-tried-to-cash-it/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly $15,000 check bounced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A team spokesperson said it was “a bank error” and that money was then wired to Shipley’s account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These accidents happen, sure. It would’ve been forgivable if Snyder’s shiny plaything hadn’t been the culprit.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His fragile ego is such that staffers at FedEx Field, the Commanders’ home stadium, told fans</span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/commanders-ask-fans-to-put-away-sell-the-team-signs-during-home-game-vs-packers/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">they couldn’t raise their “Sell the Team” signs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the Oct. 23 game. The organization said signs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">must be “handheld, event-related, in good taste, and cannot obstruct another guest&#8217;s view.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fans, maybe it was the allegations of</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/10/17/dan-snyder-dc-attorney-general-investigation/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sexual harassment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against team cheerleaders and women working in the organization. Or claims of </span><a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/d-c-attorney-general-set-to-take-action-against-commanders-owner-dan-snyder-per-report/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">underreporting ticket sales</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Or Snyder’s frequent </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/12/29/dwayne-haskins-daniel-snyder-washington-football-team/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meddling in personnel decisions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with lousy results. The franchise even faced complaints</span><a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/238813/patriot-games/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it sold peanuts from an airline that had gone out of business months earlier</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s gross.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snyder won’t go easily. An ESPN report, citing owner, league and team sources,</span><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34778123/washington-commanders-owner-dan-snyder-claims-dirt-nfl-owners-roger-goodell" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims Snyder has secrets on other NFL owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, making it tougher for them to force him out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He should do himself, the rest of the league and long-suffering fans a favor and sell the team willingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Snyder, it would be one of the most honorable things you could do since buying the franchise.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodness knows all the disrepute you’ve already caused. </span></p>

(Courtesy Candace Blue) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Candace Blue became part of the club no parent wants to join, she faced a stark choice: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Totally shut down following the shooting death of her only child,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/article_111e64de-cbf5-11e8-bcc9-7b437ff07501.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">25-year-old Namel Prince Augustine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or transform that mindless violence on a Chesapeake sidewalk in 2018, so that parents and siblings confronting similar circumstances could find support – and a reason to keep going. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue chose the latter. But it took time, perseverance and help from friends and people she met who had suffered murders of their own children.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just go and talk and try to encourage kids,” she told me this week, “and seek out what they’re in need of.”   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I learned about Blue at an</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/06/symphony-of-consolation-will-counter-violence/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“Evening of Hope,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Norfolk event where the Virginia Symphony Orchestra, chorale members and nonviolence advocates comforted the relatives of those slain in shootings. Organizers also honored first responders.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A photo montage of those killed in Hampton Roads shootings included Sierra Jenkins, the Virginian-Pilot reporter slain</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/24/we-must-do-something-to-stem-this-wanton-bloodshed/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">outside a restaurant-bar while caught in the crossfire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it was impossible to ignore that nearly every photo was of a Black male. Homicide victims and suspects across the country are</span><a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/expanded-homicide" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">disproportionately African American men</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and teenagers. </span></p>

(Photo courtesy Candace Blue)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hampton Roads slayings, then, were a disturbing representation of that trend in miniature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When are we going to get a handle on this?” Blue challenged the crowd of 1,000 that night. “I didn’t ask for it, and my son didn’t ask for it.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t let another mother suffer,” she continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augustine was getting ready to start a new job, and</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/article_587cdb4a-82ec-11e9-b676-97584cdfa535.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">he planned to attend Tidewater Community College in an automotive program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He wanted to get his own place for himself and his then-3-year-old-daughter, Samorah.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was found on a sidewalk near his grandmother’s home, where he lived. Blue said Augustine was returning from a convenience store, and she believes it was a robbery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Det. Alison Robare, the Chesapeake Police Department’s cold case detective, told me Wednesday the case is still open and being “actively investigated.” No one has ever been arrested. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I do believe he knew the suspect,” she said. “The likelihood is it could’ve been a robbery or a physical altercation began.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone with information can call Robare at 757-382-8246. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within a year of the slaying, Blue started an anti-violence foundation named after her son. The nonprofit</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Namelprince.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Namel Prince Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> holds peer-led support group meetings for parents of slain children. Participants work through their grief and try to move forward.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundation has raised money to award about a dozen scholarships for college expenses. It has worked with</span><a href="https://www.sharkcitydrum.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Shark City Drum and Dance Corps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a local youth organization that performed at the Norfolk event and had folks in the crowd bobbing their heads.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The orchestra concert occurred a day after</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/youngkin-announces-operation-bold-blue-line-initiative/article_94e2e64f-3c9f-5b9b-8ae6-7ae070fcfc9c.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin journeyed to Norfolk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to announce “Operation Bold Blue Line,” his administration’s plan to invest in policing around the state to reduce violent crime. The proposal includes</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/october/name-941358-en.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">accelerating the payment of $75 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for equipment and training to state and local agencies, and a $30 million campaign to recruit officers from in and outside of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s heavy on law enforcement efforts. That’s understandable, given a recent increase in homicides and violent crimes in the commonwealth. Some police agencies are having a</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/local/vp-nw-police-vacancy-update-20221008-mtwrouxljfgpbkxucr3iawsi6a-story.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=46c28860-7ee3-47dc-9346-a22dc069c96e" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">hard time filling vacancies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a problem exacerbated since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet it’s also important to bolster foundations like the one run by Blue. They’re on the ground doing time-consuming work that’s difficult to measure. They’re run on a shoestring. They’ve received only dollops of state funding; many rely on private donations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several nonprofits were started by family members of people gunned down in domestic violence, street crime or random shootings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fiancée of Quincy Jones started the</span><a href="https://abuunityfoundation.org/about-us" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Abu Unity Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after Jones was shot dead while waiting for a cab in 2003 in Newport News. It provides mentoring, workshops and performing arts to children and young adults.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carol Adams, a Richmond police officer, began her</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thecaroladamsfoundation/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">eponymously named foundation in 2014</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assist families facing domestic violence and other traumatic crimes. Her mother was killed in a domestic violence shooting in 1980 when Adams was 17.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tarting the organization was “a part of God’s plan,” Adams told me this week. “Working with the children is really, really important.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monica Atkins founded</span><a href="https://stoptheviolence757.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop the Violence: 757</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after her adult son was killed in a</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/article_aa6abcec-df3d-5f44-a0e2-637eef302468.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">drive-by shooting in Portsmouth in 2014</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its website notes: “It’s not enough to talk about it. We need to be in the community to save our future.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue, who spoke at the concert, splits her time between her day job supervising the city of Virginia Beach’s housing programs, running the foundation and helping raise her granddaughter, who’s now 7. It’s a sad fact that so many grandparents are thrust into that latter role after violent slayings of their own offspring.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope and I pray that she’s able to maneuver this cycle of her life,” Blue said of her granddaughter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tending to the next generation gives her purpose – and hope. “You have to build,” she told me. “We want to show there are opportunities for better things.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I pray more people hear her message – and heed it. </span></p>

Norrell School in Richmond. (Scott Elmquist / Style Weekly) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has adopted a new tack in trying to stem thousands of teacher vacancies across Virginia. He wants to hire more educators for the state’s 1.25 million students in K-12 public schools, and the</span> <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/ed/ED-3---Addressing-Teacher-Shortages-in-Virginia-Schools.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guv has bet that lowering the bar for licensure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will ease the shortfall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He should reassess that wager. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin signed an executive directive last month allowing the superintendent of public instruction to issue licenses to teachers credentialed in other states. Grants for recruitment and retention bonuses will target divisions with high and persistent teacher vacancy rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration also just launched a social media and advertising campaign to urge people to</span> <a href="https://becomeateacher.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Become a Teacher.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pre-pandemic Oct. 1, 2019, “snapshot” of school staffing found 1,063 teacher vacancies in Virginia, a state Department of Education spokesman told me by email. That compares to an Oct. 1, 2021, total of 2,563 – the most recent data available. States around the country face similar teacher shortages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guv, though, should’ve consulted more with critics of the proposals he announced last month. He’s not attacking the problem at its roots. Plus, he risks weakening standards just to get more bodies in front of the classroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of his earlier initiatives, a teacher snitch line – the euphemism is “tip line” – had a chilling effect too. More on that later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Detractors say, with justification, that his proposals don’t solve the underlying reasons why recruiting and retaining educators are such hard sells here. Low pay, a chronic issue in Virginia, is likely the biggest reason. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtually every teacher survey notes pay is the No. 1 factor in leaving the profession, James J. Fedderman, president of the 40,000-member Virginia Education Association, told me this week. The state also ranks near the bottom in most surveys tracking teacher pay, he noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury previously cited a</span> <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/teacher-pay-penalty-dips-but-persists-in-2019-public-school-teachers-earn-about-20-less-in-weekly-wages-than-nonteacher-college-graduates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Economic Policy Institute that ranked Virginia last in the country in terms of the “teacher wage penalty,” referring to the gap in weekly salaries between teachers and other college-educated professionals.</span> <a href="https://www.business.org/hr/workforce-management/best-us-states-for-teachers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year ranked Virginia 49th (behind Arizona and Washington, D.C.) when comparing the average salary of teachers to the average salary for all jobs in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Pyle, the state DOE spokesman, noted Youngkin signed a budget with a 5% pay supplement effective Aug. 1, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">another 5% supplement effective July 1, 2023. The budget also includes a $1,000 bonus for each teaching and support position. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a start, but there’s a lot of catching up to do for teachers here. It’s noteworthy that federal pandemic money will pay for the increases. Would the state have done this on its own? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spending priorities are particularly galling when you consider Virginia’s wealth compared to other states. For example,</span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/slideshows/10-wealthiest-states-in-america?slide=2" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is a top 10 state in household income</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it ranks</span> <a href="https://thecommonwealthinstitute.org/the-half-sheet/high-capacity-low-effort-virginias-school-funding-is-low-compared-to-most-rich-states/?emci=f738fc88-1e10-ec11-981f-501ac57ba3ed&amp;emdi=aa431e7d-ad10-ec11-981f-501ac57ba3ed&amp;ceid=744714" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">41st in state per-pupil fundin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">g. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another issue is preparation. Some career-switchers who get into education lack the experience of being in front of the classroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That might mean they’re more likely to quit after a few years.</span> <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/393500/workers-highest-burnout-rate.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent Gallup poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that K-12 workers have the highest levels of burnout of all industries in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim McKnight runs the Center for Teacher Leadership at Virginia Commonwealth University, and she’s directing an expansion of VCU’s teacher residency program, called RTR. Students are paid for a year to partner with experienced educators in hard-to-staff schools. So they get hands-on training and funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re learning alongside an expert,” McKnight told me Wednesday. “It’s not just getting them here, but keeping them here.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fedderman noted teachers face a lack of respect from public officials. “Teachers don’t have autonomy to teach the truth in the classroom,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sounds like a swipe at Youngkin’s denunciation of critical race theory, which he used to help win the 2021 gubernatorial election.</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/20/youngkin-quickly-embraces-culture-wars-telegraphing-a-worrisome-four-years/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">His first executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banned CRT, even though K-12 schools don’t teach it in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the snitch line. Youngkin, a Republican, early this year announced the start of an email address to</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/04/13/youngkin-tip-line-lawsuit-virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report parental rights violations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and “inherently divisive practices in schools.” Educators, state Democrats and celebrities criticized the tactic. News media outlets sued over the administration’s refusal to release records about it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move evoked decades-old tactics in communist countries, where neighbors spied on neighbors in places like</span> <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/east-german-stasi-had-189000-informers-study-says/a-3184486" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">East Germany</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2007/12/22/17376494/whisperers-of-stalins-russia-find-their-voice" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soviet Union under Stalin.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s deplorable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fedderman told me he’s unaware of any teacher firings or resignations because of the tip line. Instead, he noted, “People have seen that for what it is: a divisive tactic to pit parents against teachers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should be a collaborative, cohesive unit” so children become the best they can be, the union chief added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed. Youngkin’s directive on teacher hiring might help bolster numbers, but he’ll need to do much more to keep teachers in the classroom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ending the snitch line should be part of the package, Comrade. </span></p>

Trump supporters gathered in the nation's capital to protest the ratification of President-elect Joe Biden's Electoral College victory over President Trump in the 2020 election. A pro-Trump mob later stormed the Capitol, breaking windows and clashing with police officers.

They are among the nearly 300 GOP nominees nationwide competing for the U.S. House, Senate and major statewide offices who contend Joe Biden didn’t win the presidency in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suspect the analysis would’ve uncovered more Republican Party deniers in the commonwealth, but our General Assembly contests aren’t this year. Nor are Virginia’s two U.S. senators, both Democrats, up for reelection in November.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden won 306 electoral votes in the presidential contest against Donald Trump (the magic number is 270). Biden’s popular vote totals were 7 million higher than those of his opponent too. Besides,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2020/election-integrity/?itid=lk_inline_manual_11" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">numerous courts and state officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruled in the Democrat’s favor after Trump’s bogus claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bupkis, the refuseniks say. They swallow</span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/big-lie-trump-stolen-election-inside-creation" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Big Lie”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Biden stole the election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Post identified election deniers based on “public statements, social media posts and actions taken by the candidates to deny the legitimacy of the last presidential vote.” Whether these candidates truly believe this garbage, or instead hew to what’s politically expedient, is another story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s all based on a huge lie by</span><a href="https://billmoyers.com/story/selections-from-the-dangerous-case-of-donald-trump/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an egomaniac who can’t stand being a loser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Shame on him and his craven enablers around the country. They’re betting Democrats and independents won’t be as ruthless and unhinged as they are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Continuing these lies erodes trust in government,” Rebecca Bromley-Trujillo, research director at the nonpartisan Wason Center at Christopher Newport University, told me this week. The center conducts surveys and political analysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials might change how they operate, she added, if an election doesn’t go their party’s way, even if they run a supposedly nonpartisan office. They may call for expensive election audits that aren’t necessary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet “we have evidence that it has been a trustworthy process,” Bromley-Trujillo said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s unpersuadables are candidates in safe GOP seats and competitive ones. They include longtime incumbents – who must know better – and would-be congresspeople.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This upside-down world could no longer be dismissed after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The continuing rejection of facts is an attack on democracy, governance and the will of a majority of Americans and the Electoral College.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We could face civil unrest if a duly elected candidate doesn’t gain office because of thuggery or political chicanery. The climate for that is even more possible because current nominees who win, as The Post wrote, “will hold some measure of power overseeing American elections.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n short, the United States could devolve into a banana republic. Political upheaval might be continuous. Western democracies abroad will wonder what the hell happened.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I’ve created this questionnaire for the Addled Eight in Virginia. They’re incumbents Rob Wittman, Bob Good, Ben Cline and H. Morgan Griffith, and House candidates Jen Kiggans, Yesli Vega, Leon Benjamin and Hung Cao.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I won’t hold my breath waiting for their responses. Unlike them, I’m not delusional: </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the incumbents: You say the presidential vote was rigged or stolen by Biden. Why, then, didn’t you immediately resign and demand a new contest after you won in 2020?  </span></li>
<li>For would-be congresspeople: Shouldn’t you welcome do-overs in your nominating contests? Does fraud happen <i>only </i>when you lose?</li>
<li>For state Sen. Jen Kiggans: You won a seat in Hampton Roads by <i>less than one percentage point</i> in 2019. How odd did you feel when your Democratic opponent conceded<a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/elections/vp-nw-elx-turpin-concedes-20191107-bxvbe5pplzdpheoio3qgd5rhiu-story.html" target="_blank"> within two days of the results</a>? Was she a chump?</li>
<li>For all: If injected with truth serum, what would you say about the 2020 presidential contest? Would it jibe with your public pronouncements?</li>
<li>Do you take any responsibility for the fact that an overwhelming majority of Republicans nationwide, an average of<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/09/28/nearly-700-days-later-most-republicans-still-believe-trumps-big-lie/" target="_blank"> 64% over the course of nine polls</a> by Monmouth University since the election, say Biden won only due to voter fraud?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_331949ca-1a8f-5607-babb-04f5cfe75dae.html" target="_blank">Shelly Simonds, a Democrat, lost a 2017 General Assembly contest</a> that came down to picking a canister out of a bowl. Judges had to assess the validity of some ballots cast for the Newport News seat in the House of Delegates. Would you, facing similar circumstances, spend the next two years whining about the result and causing discord – à la Trump – or instead stay in the background and prepare for a winning campaign later,<a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_4ff9e750-328f-11e8-b0f8-5bdb57533b66.html" target="_blank"> as Simonds did</a>?</li>
<li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-fact-checker-tracked-trump-claims/2021/01/23/ad04b69a-5c1d-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html" target="_blank">Former President Trump is a serial liar;</a> he spouted more than 30,000 falsehoods while in office. He’s been the subject of lawsuits<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-fact-checker-tracked-trump-claims/2021/01/23/ad04b69a-5c1d-11eb-a976-bad6431e03e2_story.html" target="_blank"> dating back decades</a> alleging various illegal or unethical business practices. Family-run and other businesses have said Trump or his companies<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/" target="_blank"> stiffed contractors for work</a> they had done, sometimes leading to the demise of their firms. Why then do you trust Trump’s claims about 2020 – or any of his assertions?</li>
<li>If you cannot discern fact from fiction given the mountain of evidence that Biden won fair and square, why should you be entrusted to analyze issues, pass legislation and impact the lives of millions of Americans?</li>
<li>What’s more important: democracy or being in power?</li>
<li>What will you say to Americans if your continued baseless support of the Big Lie leads to violence, murder and anarchy around the United States?</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I noted earlier, these GOP candidates won’t reply to my survey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You, however, should demand answers.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This act of musical consolation will occur at an Oct. 18 concert featuring the Virginia Symphony Orchestra, a combined gospel choir and recognition of the family members of people slain in the region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the unrelenting numbers of gun-related homicides in the commonwealth, it could just as easily be a love letter to localities around Virginia facing the same crisis. Goodness knows too many people are dying, whether in arguments, as innocent bystanders or over drug disputes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s called the “Evening of Hope.”</span><a href="https://theurcnorfolk.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Urban Renewal Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which focuses its community-building efforts on the seven major cities in Hampton Roads, the VSO and others are</span><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/evening-of-hope-tickets-407069103647?utm_source=eventbrite&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=post_publish&amp;utm_content=shortLinkNewEmail" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sponsoring the free event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Harrison Opera House in Norfolk. I don’t recall a musical gathering like this before in Virginia, but I could be wrong.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evening will also recognize first responders including police officers, emergency medical technicians and hospital trauma specialists who confront violence and its aftermath.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 400 people have registered so far at the 1,600-plus-seat venue.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antipas Harris, founder and president of the center, said the genesis for the concert came from talking to people damaged by the all-too-frequent carnage. He picked up chatter on the issue while driving for a ride-sharing company.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Norfolk Police Department spokesman told me, for example, that homicides for the first nine months of the year rose from 36 in 2020, to 47 in 2021, to 53 this year. In Richmond, homicides totaled 50 for all of 2020, 60 last year and 43 through Sept. 30, police there said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The steady increase in homicides occurred statewide too, from 391 in 2018 to 562 in 2021,</span><a href="https://vsp.virginia.gov/sections-units-bureaus/bass/criminal-justice-information-services/uniform-crime-reporting/#CrimeVA" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Virginia State Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The weapons used in the overwhelming majority of cases each year in Virginia are firearms.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spike has been repeated</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/28/1041082833/during-the-pandemic-the-fbi-says-murders-surged-in-the-u-s" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nationwide during the pandemic,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when homicides rose by 30%. However, NPR reported the homicide rate is still lower in the United States than it was in the 1990s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It occurred to me there were people living in grief,” Harris said. “People have gotten anesthetized” to the shootings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s true. If we don’t know the individual, or can’t connect with a victim because of race or shared circumstances, it’s easy to hear the news, sigh and keep on moving.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a coping mechanism. The dismissal of the horror, though, means murders have become almost “acceptable” in too many places.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the concert is a way to confront the slayings but also comfort the survivors grappling with loss from all types of homicides.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Violence is violence,” Harris said, adding, “I want to draw attention to suffering families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front-line workers are included because they face an experience most of us can’t imagine in trying to save gravely wounded people. “The hospitals tell me it’s one business they want to be out of,” he noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked the community leader whether an event like this one is really “anti-violence.” No guns will be seized, of course. No demands for new laws are likely to be mentioned.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris replied he’s trying to keep politics out of the effort, because people shut down when you talk, for instance, about gun control versus gun rights. What he’s focusing on instead is “the humanity of the people shot.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an epidemic,” he continued. “And I’m taking a different approach. It’s a crisis that’s killing our people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the people memorialized will be Sierra Jenkins, the Virginian-Pilot reporter gunned down while leaving a popular downtown Norfolk nightspot in March.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 25-year-old woman was an innocent bystander, and then-Norfolk Police Chief Larry Boone said an apparent dispute inside the restaurant-bar</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/24/we-must-do-something-to-stem-this-wanton-bloodshed/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“over a spilled drink” led to the shooting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She was one of several people killed or wounded in the early morning gunfire. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, many other people could be included in the memorial: </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Oct. 18 concert can’t bring the dead back to life.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can heighten awareness. It can comfort survivors. It can spark a desire for people to become more engaged in their communities to fight violence.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would be enough. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Against this dire backdrop, Virginia’s two senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, recently secured $25 million in a budget proposal for imperiled Tangier Island, the place</span><a href="https://theworld.org/stories/2014-07-20/island-chesapeake-bay-disappearing-and-so-british-dialect-and-piece-history" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">once explored by John Smith and colonized by the English</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> centuries ago.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money would fund a pilot project to repurpose dredging material on Tangier,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/09/02/tangier-island-virginia-congress-funding/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The funding still has several legislative steps to clear before becoming law. Tangier residents can’t afford to pay for such projects themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disconnect between dire climate reality and rose-colored optimism is stark.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor does the dredging proposal take into account similarly jeopardized communities around the United States. They will beg for their own federal lifeline. Most are bigger and have thousands more people than the 1.2-square-mile island in the Chesapeake Bay with a population of about 450 people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The adage remains true: Size matters.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet I wasn’t surprised by the sanguine statements Kaine and Warner, both Democrats, issued about bolstering Tangier. They’re representing their constituents, after all.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The island “boasts a thriving tourism industry, a rich history, and a delicate natural ecosystem that boasts the Chesapeake Bay’s signature blue crabs,” Warner, through a spokesperson, said Tuesday. “Most importantly, Tangier is home to hundreds of Virginians – many of them watermen who have driven Virginia’s seafood industry for many generations. The truth is, we can’t afford to give up on such a quintessential part of Virginia.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine noted through a spokesperson: “Tangier is a cultural and historic gem that is treasured by people from all over America, as well as a crucial piece of the Chesapeake Bay’s fishing and crabbing economy. I’m fighting for this funding because Virginians and all Americans stand to lose a great deal if this island becomes uninhabitable.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Rep. Elaine Luria, a fellow Democrat, recently toured the island with local officials.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative by the two senators is well-meaning, but dubious. Enormous sums of taxpayer dollars would be needed to fight against nature. It could be a fruitless task. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed funding is a fraction of an estimated</span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.779774/full?utm_source=fweb&amp;utm_medium=nblog&amp;utm_campaign=ba-sci-fclim-prediction-of-the-climate-change-driven-exodus-of-the-town-of-Tangier-the-last-offshore-island-fishing-community-in-Virginia-Chesapeake-Bay" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$250 million to $350 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needed to fully restore and protect Tangier Island, David Schulte, a marine biologist with the Army Corps of Engineers in Norfolk, told me this week. He’s been visiting the island since 2002, and he co-wrote research with his son last year about the island’s current situation and long-term outlook.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schulte’s dim assessment, if there’s no large-scale intervention: The town could be abandoned by 2053.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I personally would like to save the island,” Schulte noted. “Their culture is very unique.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal funding to Tangier, however, would delay the tough – though necessary – discussion about whether to relocate the dwindling number of residents on the island 12 miles from the Eastern Shore. A comprehensive, national approach is needed for similarly jeopardized communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tangier dredging initiative is a stop-gap effort, at best. Schulte noted officials would still need to raise homes on the island and do lots more work.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Climate Central analysis found that almost </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">650,000 individual parcels of property, across up to 4.4 million acres, are projected to fall below changing tidal boundaries by 2050</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can be sure states will be asking the feds to help.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ll make their cases for populations much bigger than Tangier’s.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The island has gained lots of media attention since then-President Donald Trump reached out to Mayor James “Ooker” Eskridge in 2017, after the mayor told CNN he loved Trump </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“as much as any family member I got.” Trump assured Eskridge the island would be around for hundreds of years to come, and that he believed – like many islanders – rising seas aren’t a threat.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much for science. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Islanders are right, though, to be upset that government promises of help often went on the back burner. For example, a jetty project finally was completed two years ago with state and federal money, but it had been delayed about two decades.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there’s the aid nearby communities received. As The Post noted: “(Tangier) residents had watched with frustration as the federal government funded projects to protect a National Wildlife Refuge and residents on nearby Smith Island and to restore a wildlife habitat on Poplar Island, where no people live — using the same method on Poplar of repurposing dredge material.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the way, I take no joy in revisiting the issue of Tangier’s fate.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wrote</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_5d2a65ae-b5ff-5c55-9c61-e0c1ef757c02.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a column in 2014 headlined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spending to keep Tangier above water makes no cents.” In it, I opined it’s smarter to use limited public funding to relocate folks than to pay more money to fight “a battle that Mother Nature seems destined – and determined – to win” by reclaiming the island. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging by some responses, you would’ve thought I’d disparaged the way of life on Tangier, including its unique dialect and economy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You would never suggest relocation for the people of, say, New Orleans!” one fumed. Well, more than 375,000 people live in the Big Easy – and that’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Katrina. Moving residents there would be a more herculean, expensive task.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s history on Tangier that goes back to the era of Jamestown!” OK. But given many of my detractors no longer lived on the island, they’d already voted with their feet. They were wistful for a place that was disappearing.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as now, I wanted to save the lives of Tangier’s residents and use federal dollars wisely. The per-person expenditure to save Tangier is enormous. Other places around the country would say, fairly, “Why not us too?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relocation from Tangier isn’t cheap either, Schulte said. The cost, including decommissioning or abandonment, could be from $100 million to $200 million. That’s still less than the expense of “saving” Tangier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What are we as a society going to do about people facing this situation?” Schulte asked.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a vital question. It’s one lawmakers must address nationwide – not just for Tangier.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only then can they make smart choices. </span></p>

Paul LePage walks with supporters to the Maine State House in early 2022 to turn petitions to run for governor. (Maine Beacon)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wish Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin would decide what type of leader he wants to be regarding race. His mixed signals could give you whiplash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few weeks ago, with tons of fanfare, Youngkin announced a unique partnership that will pump</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/26/innovative-partnership-for-petersburg-shouldnt-be-judged-by-politics/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">resources and attention to Petersburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a majority-Black, long-struggling city of 33,000 people just south of Richmond. It’s a hopeful moment for a place that’s witnessed lots of despair.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wrote that, despite the obvious politics involved in the partnership, the people living in Petersburg simply want results and welcome the help.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet on Wednesday, the Republican guv with less than a year in office will stump for former Maine Gov. Paul LePage, whose</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/09/03/youngkin-virginia-black-white-division/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">racist comments and violent threats against perceived opponents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have drawn national attention since at least 2016. This is the latest out-of-state trek for Youngkin, who’s</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3612075-youngkin-traveling-to-five-more-states-amid-talk-of-possible-2024-bid/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">continuing to burnish his national profile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More on the unrivaled “charm” of LePage later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s double-dealing approach toward people of color is all his, however. The Washington Post recently chronicled</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/09/03/youngkin-virginia-black-white-division/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">his litany of contradictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s gone to historically Black colleges to tout his plans for lab schools, but he crusaded against the concept of “racial equity” in education policy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He seems to get downright squeamish about the concept of equity, in fact, when it comes to acknowledging laws, practices and customs that have favored White people in Virginia and nationwide. Witness the fact that his</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-1-Ending-the-Use-of-Inherently-Divisive-Concepts.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">first executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banned critical race theory, even though the study of structural racism wasn’t part of Virginia’s K-12 public school curriculum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has worked with Black ministers. But he appointed a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">state health commissioner,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/23/board-of-health-calls-commissioners-comments-an-embarrassment/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Colin Greene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who said he felt discussing racism alienates White people. African-Americans, who are affected by biased treatment and disparate health outcomes, were outraged.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(In one notable example nationally,</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/us/susan-moore-black-doctor-indiana.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a Black doctor</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">who later died of COVID-19 said a White physician had downplayed her complaints of pain. Dr. Susan Moore had been treated in a suburban Indianapolis hospital, and her comments were posted on Facebook.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Post article included other examples, too, of Youngkin’s disjointedness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get it: Pandering to a sizable part of the electorate has its advantages. Focusing on cultural issues, including public education, helped catapult Youngkin to the governor’s chair. So did his decision to play coy,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/08/youngkin-mcauliffe-spar-over-election-audits/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">during the Republican nominating process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about whether he accepted the fact Democrat Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election. Donald Trump had lied repeatedly about the outcome, and his followers demanded candidates accept that lie too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This stumping for LePage, though, isn’t even necessary. Youngkin could burnish his conservative bona fides and continue to thrust his name in front of voters around the country without supporting a bigot and a bully.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you don’t know much about Maine, whose population of 1.3 million residents is much smaller than Virginia’s, or LePage, a former two-term governor who’s running for the top job again in the Northeastern state. Unless you’re eating a Maine lobster, you probably don’t care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no excuse for Youngkin to be ignorant, though, of the oft-unhinged racist he’s going to bat for. Youngkin could’ve easily passed on this trip and saved his powder for a more deserving Republican. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LePage’s “greatest hits” are a mixture of racist tropes and other lies. He said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 90% of people arrested for drug-trafficking in Maine, which is 94% White, were Black or Hispanic. The claim wasn’t true, at least not according to the statistics he provided</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/09/27/maines-governor-has-a-binder-of-suspected-drug-dealers-but-90-percent-of-them-are-not-black-or-hispanic/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in his binder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former governor also called Black and Hispanic people “the enemy” and said that many out-of-state drug traffickers passing through Maine “impregnate a young White girl before they leave.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter claim is especially sinister given the history of lynchings of Black men in this country – often following false accusations of rape.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He left a threatening voicemail back then for a Democratic state legislator. LePage said he longed for the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">days when</span><a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2016/08/26/prove-im-a-racist-lepage-challenges-westbrook-legislator-in-obscenity-laced-voice-mail/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">he could have killed the Democrat in a duel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, on the campaign trail, LePage was at it again.</span><a href="https://www.necn.com/news/politics/former-maine-gov-paul-lepage-threatens-violence-in-video-im-gonna-deck-you/2808823/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He threatened to “deck” a Democratic Party staffer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who the candidate said was getting too close to him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great lesson, Mr. LePage, for the children. Resort to violence to settle differences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Maine Democratic Party said the person recording the video is a staff research associate. Political parties often videotape their opponents, as former</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2011/06/allen-apologizes-for-macaca-moment-056212" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. George Allen knows all too well from a 2006 incident</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, when questioned last week about why he was heading to Maine to support LePage, told The Washington Post, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I’m trying to do is help Republicans win.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He said he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wasn’t aware of any controversy about the Maine politician’s rhetoric.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such ignorance strains credulity. The public record on LePage is easy to find. Just do an internet search.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Richmond collected 474 firearms in August from 160 people, and organizers gave out gift cards of $25 to $250, depending on the type of gun and whether they even still worked.</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/474-firearms-collected-at-richmond-buyback-event-on-aug-20/article_38ba50f1-5f06-57fa-b77a-bd41ac91471b.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond used $80,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in federal pandemic aid for the event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are these buybacks effective? No, say university professors, independent studies and other experts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet even with that acknowledgment, a few caveats should be added. Gun buybacks aren’t a total failure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the facts:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an estimated</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/24/we-must-do-something-to-stem-this-wanton-bloodshed/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">400 million firearms in America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, anything collected by authorities during these events is negligible. Scooping up hundreds of guns means little in the scheme of things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having a gun buyback is like trying to drain the pool with a dropper,” Alex Tabarrok, an economics professor who studies crime at George Mason University, told me Wednesday. “The people selling the guns are often happy to do so. … It’s not changing the demand for guns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It may be good for some publicity,” Tabarrok added, “but it doesn’t do anything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the same basic conclusion of a</span><a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28763/w28763.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">study released in 2021 by the National Bureau of Economic Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a private nonprofit organization. The depressing title: “Have U.S. gun buyback programs misfired?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We find no evidence that (gun buyback programs) reduce gun crime,” three university professors wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also find no evidence that GBPs reduce suicides or homicides where a firearm was involved,” they continued. “These results call into question the efficacy of city gun buyback programs in their current form.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ouch. That’s a scathing assessment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why hold them at all?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Horwitz is co-director of the</span><a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/research-and-practice/center-for-gun-violence-solutions" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Gun Violence Solutions at John Hopkins University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which researches and advocates ways to prevent gun-related injuries and slayings. Buybacks don’t recover enough guns to make “a populational effect,” Horwitz conceded. However, they “can be a way for communities to come together, build relationships and trust. There’s no harm in them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there other gun-related initiatives that would work better? Horwitz suggested several.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said a growing body of evidence shows “community violence interventions” can save lives. Horwitz also cited</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/operation-ceasefire-and-safe-community-partnership" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Operation Ceasefire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as one workable strategy. It’s a program where various community and law enforcement groups join to deter gang and youth gun violence, while also offering individuals workforce training, employment and other services.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/01/after-months-of-wrangling-virginia-has-a-budget-deal-whats-in-it/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia legislators agreed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year to a $2.5 million annual grant fund that targets a small number of people most likely to shoot someone or become a shooting victim.</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/12/22/a-last-minute-budget-gambit-wont-solve-gun-violence-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Todd Gilbert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Shenandoah, has been a major proponent of such a program in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horwitz also suggested the use of so-called “violence interrupters” who live in the same neighborhoods as potential criminals, may have been in prison themselves and can influence young men before they face the same fate. “They’re very credible,” he said, “and they can offer solutions and services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One policy Virginia hasn’t adopted – but should, Horwitz believes – is a process called “licensing for buying a handgun” or “permit to purchase.” It goes beyond the usual steps for gun buyers to include things like enhanced background checks. The process deters buyers from transferring guns or selling to straw purchasers.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-center-for-gun-violence-prevention-and-policy/_docs/Impact%20of%20Handgun%20Purchaser%20Licensing%20White%20Paper%202022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A paper from Johns Hopkins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says nine states and Washington, D.C., “have handgun purchaser licensing laws that apply to virtually all handgun transfers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tabarrok pointed me to</span> <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25798/w25798.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research that showed something as simple as boosting street lighting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could have a big impact. The 2016 study in New York City public housing developments found “communities that were assigned more lighting experienced sizable reductions in crime.” That seems like a no-brainer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of these steps focus on a persistent, pernicious problem –</span> <a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/expanded-homicide" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the disproportionate number of Black victims and suspects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in homicides. Or the fact that so many gun-related slayings involve tons of foolishness and insanity, from possibly outsized reactions to a</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/24/we-must-do-something-to-stem-this-wanton-bloodshed/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“spilled drink”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a restaurant-bar</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/17/when-gun-violence-and-domestic-violence-intertwine-overhaul-a-culture-of-disdain-and-disrespect/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">domestic violence shootings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that kill and injure and traumatize survivors who witnessed the carnage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steps like Operation Ceasefire and fighting a callous culture of death take more time, effort and money than gun buybacks. That’s why the latter are so alluring for many localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t help much. They don’t really hurt either. Buybacks can be a small step in a comprehensive approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should communities spend more time and money focusing on proven deterrence? Of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, though, folks just want a small victory against so much bloodshed.&#8217;</span></p>

(Photo by Julia Rendleman for the Washington Post)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few cities have boosters as effusive as Yvette Robinson of Petersburg. The longtime resident attended</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/08/22/youngkin-petersburg-virginia-education-crime/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this week’s unique, wide-ranging partnership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcement by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Petersburg Mayor Samuel Parham to bolster the struggling community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robinson was so pumped by the announcement she wanted EVERYBODY to know it was time to jettison negativity and work together for the place she’s called home since the late 1960s, when she enrolled at Virginia State University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the skepticism,” Robinson, 72, told me Thursday, recounting the combination of governmental, faith-based and community groups that gathered for the symbolism-laden event. Hundreds of people attended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think people have such a feeling of despair,” she added, “but as the Good Book says, there’s hope.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, along with several of his Cabinet secretaries, and Parham raised that hope. They announced dozens of initiatives to assist this city of 33,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a place beset by violence, poverty,</span><a href="https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/reports/state-reports/2022-virginia-state-report" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">rock-bottom health metrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and few high-paying jobs. Some 20,000 people, or nearly two-thirds, are on public assistance, the mayor told me. The poverty hampers what Petersburg can generate in taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rare city-state partnership grew out of several discussions between Youngkin, a Republican, and Parham, a Democrat, about the city roughly 20 miles south of Richmond. Parham told me those talks began after he reached out to Youngkin shortly after the latter took office in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin this week said the two “hit it off” while initially discussing vaccines and health outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Parham said Thursday, he’s talked with administration officials every week. That entrée has proved valuable for his majority-Black city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How so? Petersburg previously tried to secure substantial amounts of state money to upgrade the Poor Creek water and wastewater facility, Parham said, but officials always fell short. This year, the city gained more than</span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2022/2/HB30/Introduced/CR/486/37c/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$29 million to do the job</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.progress-index.com/story/news/2022/08/22/petersburg-starts-knocking-down-ramada-inn/65414257007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ramada Inn, a “gateway”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the city that’s been an eyesore following its closure a decade ago, was blessed this year with a</span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2022/1/HB30/Introduced/FA/486/6h/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.6 million state budget amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will help raze it. It was no coincidence a crane began tearing down parts of the hotel the same day as the partnership presentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics noted, correctly, that many of these initiatives and their funding streams were already in the works, approved by the General Assembly this year or part of ongoing federal projects. It’s difficult to assess what’s truly “additional” dollars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That shouldn’t negate the buzz and optimism of the just-announced alliance, however.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another factor: With at least a dozen police vacancies in the local department, Virginia State Police have been patrolling city streets for several months, helping lower gun violence and providing “boots on the ground in hot spots,” Parham said. Compared to two months before the surge of state and federal resources,</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/Partnership-for-Petersburg.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">shootings declined 12% and homicides fell 56%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The citizens of Petersburg have been ecstatic,” the mayor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guv, by the way, said the partnership could be a pilot program to be used in other localities. I can imagine some communities in Virginia that would raise their hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politics, obviously, are part and parcel of this new effort. Youngkin has gotten national attention for winning the governor’s seat as a political novice. He’s tried to brand himself as someone who can attract moderates – even on a national level.</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2022/07/18/glenn-youngkin-presidential-buzz" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">News articles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tout his presidential flirtation and</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/07/14/youngkin-trump-republican-00045766" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the titillating speculation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a bait-and-switch, though, since he jumped into the culture wars on</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/28/youngkin-and-miyares-appeal-of-mask-ruling-is-a-harsh-publicity-stunt/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wearing masks during COVID-19</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/20/youngkin-quickly-embraces-culture-wars-telegraphing-a-worrisome-four-years/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">banned critical race theory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – even when it’s not taught in K-12 public schools in the commonwealth – and suggested there needs to be more “election integrity.” (A</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/10/maybe-now-we-can-lay-the-election-integrity-talk-to-rest/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">statewide audit of the 2020 election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> produced high marks for accuracy.)</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/08/22/youngkin-petersburg-virginia-education-crime/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted his administration has drawn criticism for agitating the racial divide, especially for its </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/05/whats-word-youngkin-takes-aim-equity/?itid=lk_inline_manual_7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crusades against “equity”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in school programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The so-called “Partnership for Petersburg,” then, is an olive branch to a majority-Black city that craves the help. It’s a place that’s fought getting off the mat for decades.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governor-mcclellan-carroll-foy-petersburg/2021/05/22/3cf7d3ac-b98b-11eb-a6b1-81296da0339b_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown &amp; Williamson closed its tobacco processing plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there in the mid-1980s, taking with it loads of jobs. Other manufacturers left too. Roughly 33% of residents back then had links to the tobacco industry, said Parham, a Petersburg native.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crack epidemic then wreaked havoc there and in communities around the country. A local mall closed in the early 1990s, slashing jobs and retail choices. Natural disasters harmed the city, including a</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/08/07/tornado-kills-three-near-petersburg-va/d7e9ff39-84c3-4a99-953d-94ae7994d1cb/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">deadly tornado in 1993</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that leveled parts of downtown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the potential coup de grace:</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/city-on-the-brink-petersburg-cant-pay-its-bills-and-time-is-running-out/2016/09/04/9327c962-6ef9-11e6-8533-6b0b0ded0253_story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A long-simmering fiscal crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came to a head in 2016. Petersburg had a $12 million shortfall in its operating budget and had spent all its reserves.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-governor-mcclellan-carroll-foy-petersburg/2021/05/22/3cf7d3ac-b98b-11eb-a6b1-81296da0339b_story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The city nearly went bankrupt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and officials considered cutting police and school services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe directed the state finance secretary to review the city’s capital ledger. A turnaround was achieved by 2020, partly because of better local tax collections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents, business owners and others who care about Petersburg aren’t sure what they’ll get from the new partnership. They described emotions ranging from ecstasy to caution about the rollout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the city doesn’t get a handle on the violence, a lot of the other things will be irrelevant,” said Petersburg native Shahid Shabazz, a community activist who owns a barbershop in the city and nearby Colonial Heights. He also heads a children’s academy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lack of entertainment for youth, the parks and recreation” is another drawback, Shabazz added. “It leads to idle time, misdirection.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barb Rudolph is a community activist and co-founder of “Clean Sweep Petersburg,” which fights for transparency and accountability in local government. She thinks a “pervasive feeling of powerlessness” among residents holds the city back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, “I’m encouraged by the interest and the fact they’ve gone to the effort, the state and city,” said Rudolph, who’s lived here for 42 years. “I don’t think it’s just for show.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several people told me they’re not looking for quick fixes. They said any changes should last long after Youngkin leaves state office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I believe he and his supporters will deem the Petersburg experiment a success – no matter the reality on the ground. Democrats will take potshots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg backers couldn’t care less. They’re looking at the residents and their livelihoods. They want long-lasting, consistent improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The measure of success is sustainability … not in six months, not in one year,” said Shemicia Bowen, who was raised in Petersburg and is board chair of the Urban League of Greater Richmond, an entity in the partnership.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“It can’t just be lightning in a bottle.” </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another case of likely racial discrimination in housing appraisals has cropped up, this time in Baltimore.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/realestate/housing-discrimination-maryland.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently reported a Black husband and wife first received an appraisal of $472,000. After they “whitewashed” their home – removing family photos and having a White colleague stand in for them as the “owner” – a second appraisal came in at $750,000. That’s nearly $300,000 more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is infuriating for Black and brown families. It’s also exhausting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does such bias persist? Why can’t people get what’s due?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The account of Nathan Connolly and Shani Mott is one of dozens that have gained media attention in recent years. Similar allegations have occurred in</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/12/06/black-couple-home-value-white-washing/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">California’s Bay Area</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2021/05/13/indianapolis-black-homeowner-home-appraisal-discrimination-fair-housing-center-central-indiana/4936571001/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">central Indiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/our-community/this-black-familys-home-appraisal-grew-by-92-000-after-they-removed-all-signs-of-their-race" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cincinnati</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very humiliating to strip yourself of your own home,” Connolly told The Times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appraisals often are subjective. Still, these stories suggest something more than chance is afoot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal statistics show nearly</span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">98% of property appraisers are White</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The percentage, and the comments from Black homeowners, raise questions about bias. The Fair Housing Act of 1968 says it’s illegal to discriminate in appraising residences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homeownership is a key way to pass down wealth to future generations. When the housing industry shortchanges property value, it harms families depending on an unbiased review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A</span><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/devaluation-of-assets-in-black-neighborhoods/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Brookings Institution study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">owner-occupied homes in Black neighborhoods are undervalued by $48,000 per home on average.” It studied 113 metro areas with at least one majority-Black neighborhood. In Virginia, the areas were Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Lynchburg, Richmond and Roanoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that African Americans have been able to rely on equity when it comes to housing policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nation’s history is littered with racism in the market. This includes redlining,</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/17/1049052531/racial-covenants-housing-discrimination" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">restrictive covenants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a</span><a href="https://www.commonlit.org/en/texts/how-the-gi-bill-s-promise-was-denied-to-a-million-black-wwii-veterans#:~:text=The%20GI%20Bill's%20Effect%20on%20Black%20Veterans&amp;text=Some%20could%20not%20access%20benefits,delivered%20on%20the%20bill's%20promise." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">GI Bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that in practice denied mortgages and home loans to Black veterans.</span><a href="https://t4america.org/2020/12/07/four-recommendations-to-undo-the-damage-of-urban-renewal/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Urban Renewal projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including highways, often destroyed Black communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vestiges of those decades-old policies remain today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isabel McLain, a research and policy analyst for Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia, said Monday she didn’t have exact statistics on how often under-appraisals occurred in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we understand that racially biased appraisals are a systemic problem in Virginia, based on national studies that have included or reported on Virginia communities,” she noted by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McLain cited, for example,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a Freddie Mac report released in 2021 that </span><a href="https://nationalfairhousing.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-01-18-NFHA-et-al_Analysis-of-Appraisal-Standards-and-Appraiser-Criteria_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">underscored biased devaluations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Researchers found a large portion of appraisers valued homes in majority-Black and majority-Latino neighborhoods below the contract price at rates much higher than they did for homes in majority-White neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These disparities were not driven by a few appraisers but reflect widespread trends across the profession, including appraisers in Virginia,” she noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blacks, Latinos – heck, everybody – just want to be treated fairly when it comes to housing. Numerous anecdotes and data indicate race in housing remains a fault line, one that hinders wealth and progress for people of color. </span></p>

(Virginia Department of Transportation) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials kept a list of preventive measures for dealing with a major snowstorm on the shelf. They issued promises of help to desperate, stranded motorists that they couldn’t keep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those were two of the most damning findings</span><a href="https://www.osig.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/office-of-the-state-inspector-general/pdf/performance-audits/I-95-Snow-Incident-Report-FINAL-8-11-22.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of the newly released audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Office of the State Inspector General of Virginia’s response to the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/04/nightmare-on-95-virginia-officials-apologize-to-stranded-motorists-defend-storm-prep/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan. 3-4 snow and ice storm on Interstate 95</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> near Fredericksburg. Some families were stuck on the roadway for around 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audit criticized the state police, transportation and emergency management agencies. The saga was a stunning display of ineptitude and futility by then-Gov. Ralph Northam’s outgoing administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam should be glad he wasn’t running for office soon after; he would’ve had a snowball’s chance in Hades of winning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new audit repeated some of the shortcomings cited in a previous report</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/08/how-virginia-officials-hope-to-avoid-a-repeat-of-the-snowy-shutdown-of-i-95/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">completed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">by CNA, a consulting firm that has an ongoing contract with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The audit, though, is harsher in criticizing state agencies for how they handled the storm, which dumped more than a foot of snow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one suggests planning for that freak incident was easy. Or that after several tractor-trailers jackknifed, clearing I-95 would’ve been simple. The blockage eventually engulfed a 40-mile stretch in Northern Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many new snow removal contractors hadn’t undergone typical training yet. Spring-like weather before the storm hit “may have caused the traveling public to discount the chance of significant winter weather,” the audit said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First it rained, making pre-treatment ineffective or impossible. Snow fell fast. Temperatures then dropped, creating icy roads. Communications didn’t clearly tell motorists to avoid travel on I-95, or messages provided bad info. Traffic cameras lost power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Motorists who tried to depart major interstates for side routes in Virginia faced another set of challenges. As the CNA report noted, “the primary and secondary roads that surround I-95 (such as I-64 and Routes US 1, US 3, US 301 and US 17) were all unpassable or barely passable at different times” on Jan. 3 “due to car accidents, downed wires and trees and snow-covered roads.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audit seemed to take pains not to blame Northam, who was less than two weeks from leaving office, or his administration for declining to declare a state of emergency beforehand. Early weather forecasts had suggested the declaration wasn’t needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was unforgivable, though, was their failure to follow the lessons learned during a similar snowstorm in December 2018 on Interstate 81 near Bristol. The Virginia Department of Transportation report after that incident included recommendations that could have helped during the January storm but officials neglected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why undertake such reports if you’re going to ignore them? That’s a waste of time, effort and taxpayer money. No one wants to see the 2022 audit stay on a shelf, either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked a spokeswoman for Gov. Glenn Youngkin how his administration would respond to major snowfalls and prevent a repeat of the January fiasco.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor and the administration have successfully weathered three snow-related events, mitigated risks, and ensured appropriate resources were available for our response teams, and they performed well,” said Macaulay Porter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Governor appreciates the OSIG’s performance audit of the January 3-4, 2022 Northam Administration snow incident,” she added – in case the latter wasn’t clear already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Youngkin’s leadership, Porter noted that snow events, like the one following his inauguration, “were managed to the standard of preparing for worst-case scenarios as opposed to under-preparing for snow emergency events.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the situation in early January was rare. It affected a major north-south thoroughfare along the East Coast. Youngkin’s folks should hope they never face the same set of harrowing, changing circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilfrid Nixon is a former University of Iowa engineering professor who researched the effects of weather on transportation. He also is the founder and president of the</span><a href="https://professionalsnowfightersassociation.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Professional Snowfighters Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit trade organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nixon told me that, as OSIG’s audit in Virginia recommends, it could be an asset to add snow response planning to the state’s emergency management mix. Currently, the closest thing Virginia has are what it calls “general (all-hazard) emergency plans for natural disasters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Virginia isn’t an outlier on that issue. Most states, Nixon said, forgo such snow planning and instead focus on disasters like floods, hurricanes and tornadoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also sympathized with state officials who were trying to deal with the aberrant incident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was somewhat of a black swan event. … When a storm begins with rain, you take away a lot of the effective tools in winter weather,” Nixon noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It would’ve been a bad storm anyway,” he continued. “But when you have a bad storm, without resources – particularly personnel – it becomes doubly difficult.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the state sent out a wireless message during the storm saying, “I-95 Drivers: State &amp; locals coming ASAP with supplies &amp; to move you.</span><a href="http://www.virginiadot.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">www.virginiadot.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” and didn’t follow through quickly, it lost loads of credibility. You shouldn’t provide false hope in such dire circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t like to prepare for the worst. We’d rather hope for the best – as Pollyannish as that can be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials, though, don’t have that luxury. At the very least, they must dust off old reports and apply their lessons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or the (wintry) past will repeat itself.</span></p>

Johnson Elementary School on Election Day. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>If you’ve ever wanted to work the polls on Election Day in Virginia, you’re in luck.</p>
<p>Several localities around the state need help, especially from newly trained aides. <a href="https://www.cityofchesapeake.net/government/city-departments/departments/Voter-Registrar/Working-the-Polls/election-officer.htm" target="_blank">Some cities and counties have boosted pay</a>, appealed to residents’ sense of civic duty and emphasized the role everyday Virginians play in ensuring elections run smoothly.</p>
<p>“It’s important for the community to give back, and to help us administer safe and secure elections,” Christine Lewis, director of elections for Virginia Beach, told me. The state’s largest city added eight new polling locations this year, so it now has to staff more than 100 precincts.</p>
<p>What’s left unsaid: Virginia doesn’t face the same level of electoral acrimony and conspiracies as other states following Donald Trump’s persistent lies about the 2020 presidential results.</p>
<p>Thank goodness.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because Democrat Joe Biden blitzed Trump here. He defeated the Republican standard-bearer by 10 percentage points and nearly half a million votes in Virginia in 2020. The outcome continued a recent streak of wins by Democratic presidential nominees in the commonwealth.</p>
<p>Republican Glenn Youngkin won a close gubernatorial contest against Democrat Terry McAuliffe in 2021. But Republicans obviously don’t throw shade on election results when they come out on top.</p>
<p>How convenient: When the GOP wins, the system worked. When the party loses, it must have been rigged.</p>
<p>I mention all of this after the Washington bureau of the Virginia Mercury’s parent organization, States Newsroom, reported <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/03/election-officials-at-u-s-senate-hearing-describe-threats-spread-of-misinformation/" target="_blank">on a congressional hearing seeking ways to combat violent threats</a> against election officials. Trump stoked many of those past ill-informed attacks because he was a sore loser who didn’t want to relinquish power.</p>
<p>He also incited the insurrectionists who laid waste to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and tried to negate the votes of 81 million Americans.</p>
<p>Election officials during the congressional hearing cited actions taken against them that included doxxing, in which the personal information of someone is posted publicly, and profanity-laden protests at their homes. A national survey this year said <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/one-five-us-election-workers-may-quit-amid-threats-politics-survey-2022-03-10/" target="_blank">one in five </a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/one-five-us-election-workers-may-quit-amid-threats-politics-survey-2022-03-10/" target="_blank">elections</a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/one-five-us-election-workers-may-quit-amid-threats-politics-survey-2022-03-10/" target="_blank"> officials</a> are somewhat or very unlikely to stay in their jobs through the presidential 2024 contest.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Kim Wyman, the top election security official at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said concerns for physical safety have “really ramped up since 2020 because of threats that we&#8217;ve seen to state and local officials across the country,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/17/politics/elections-midterms-2022-security-threats/index.html" target="_blank">CNN reported</a>.</p>
<p>Poll workers don’t usually draw the same level of attacks. However, some faced danger based on ginned-up, false accusations from Trump or his minions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/21/ruby-freeman-shaye-moss-jan6-testimony/" target="_blank">They included a mother and daughter in Fulton County, Ga.</a>, of which the heavily African-American city of Atlanta is part. The two women went into hiding after Rudy Giuliani made fact-free claims they had rigged the outcome in Georgia for Biden.</p>
<p>Trump helped poison what should be a nonpartisan, civic-minded task. Some states, particularly the few battlegrounds that aren’t perpetually blue or red, could face problems in finding enough people to oversee the voting booths on Election Day.</p>
<p>Yet many people who have agreed to take the job said they have a commitment to America and democracy, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2022/jul/06/poll-workers-are-short-staffed-under-attack-and-qu/" target="_blank">according to a July PolitiFact article</a>.</p>
<p>“Our whole democracy is voting, and when you lose voting, you have no democracy,” said a retired schoolteacher who became a new poll worker in Florida.</p>
<p>Several officials in Virginia told me they haven’t received reports suggesting poll workers retired because of threats or fears for their safety. Rather, officials must continually recruit because of the age of longtime poll workers, their health and ongoing fears of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Applicants must be registered voters in the state. They cannot be an elected official or an employee of an elected official.</p>
<p>“It’s a long day,” conceded Lisa McDonald, general registrar for Shenandoah County, speaking about Election Day. The 15- to 16-hour shifts turn off some people, she said, but many residents want to help out – especially in the presidential years.</p>
<p>“We recently had some responses and are getting some new workers, which is good,” she added, noting residents should feel confident in the accuracy of early voting and Election Day ballots.</p>
<p>Chesapeake, the state’s second-largest city, recently boosted pay on Election Day for poll workers to $240, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/21/a-workers-market-in-virginia-and-elsewhere-awaits-anyone-still-on-the-sidelines/" target="_blank">after the minimum wage rose to $15 per hour</a>. Previously, the rate was a little more than $11 an hour. Poll workers also receive $25 for a three-hour training session.</p>
<p>“We weren’t necessarily affected negatively” by the political atmosphere nationwide, said Keith Heyward, who coordinates the so-called “officers of elections” in Chesapeake. The city operates 66 precincts for its 172,000 registered voters.</p>
<p>“It’s an honest job,” Heyward continued. “We have an honest group of people.”</p>
<p>That’s crucial to remember.</p>
<p>People who care about this country – really care – want to make sure votes are tallied fairly, accurately and without interference. It’s an honor to handle that important task for local, state and federal elections.</p>
<p>And despicable when politicians taint the process by lying and inciting violence.</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="666" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Getty_stethoscope_small-1024x666.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Getty_stethoscope_small-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Getty_stethoscope_small-300x195.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Getty_stethoscope_small-768x499.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Getty_stethoscope_small-1536x999.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Getty_stethoscope_small.jpg 1795w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">(Prapass Pulsub / Getty Images) </p><p>Veteran newspaper people in Detroit taught me the saying, <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=No%20Shit%20Sherlock" target="_blank">“No (rhymes with spit), Sherlock,”</a> when I was a young journalist back in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>The profane phrase – I can’t do it justice in a family publication – was used to refer to a headline or story stating something so obvious, so predictable, that it called into question why an editor assigned it. (Think “Gunfire leaves neighborhood shaken” or “Blizzard keeps residents home.” You get my drift.)</p>
<p>Such articles, though, occasionally are defensible. They prove that what politicians or community activists had predicted all along indeed came to fruition.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the recent Virginia Mercury story on how <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/01/study-virginia-medicaid-expansion-increased-financial-security-for-enrollees/" target="_blank">the expansion of Medicaid in the commonwealth under Obamacare</a> – after years of spiteful, obstinate Republican opposition – provided financial security for adult enrollees.</p>
<p>The article was based on research published in the journal Health Affairs. It covered a study by lead author Hannah Shadowen, a medical student at Virginia Commonwealth University. <a href="https://hbp.vcu.edu/media/hbp-dev/pdfx27s/policy-briefs/MEDExReportFINAL.01.11.22(1).pdf" target="_blank">The study</a> was prepared for the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services.</p>
<p>This research found that new Medicaid enrollees were more likely to use a doctor’s office than more expensive emergency rooms for their usual source of care. Stress decreased for nonmedical costs, including groceries and rent.</p>
<p>“Non-Hispanic Blacks reported a larger decrease in worries about the cost of normal healthcare after enrolling in Medicaid compared to non-Hispanic Whites,” the study found, “suggesting that Medicaid expansion was particularly meaningful for this group.”</p>
<p>Also, “rural members had a greater decrease in problems paying medical bills and unmet need for prescriptions in the year after enrolling in Medicaid, compared to non-rural members.”</p>
<p>In short, the lives of new Medicaid patients improved dramatically. That’s great for the individuals – and for the state’s image, too.</p>
<p>Well, duh. NSS.</p>
<p><em>Of course</em> things got better for adults who hadn’t been in the program because of previous restrictions. <em>Of course</em> it’s preferable to have regular doctor visits and practice preventive care than to rush to high-priced ERs when a medical crisis hits.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/data/medicaid-expansion-enrollment/" target="_blank">The state says more than 677,000 adults</a> have enrolled in Medicaid since expansion started in January 2019. Advocates initially believed, before the General Assembly changed course in 2018, that about 400,000 adults with incomes ranging up to 138% of the poverty line would sign up.</p>
<p>The issue is an indictment, too, of Republican state legislators who fought so hard, for so long, to deny access to health care to more adults. In this they were motivated by politics moreso than compassion for low-income Virginians: They were trying to prevent President Barack Obama and Democrats from notching a political victory while sacrificing the health of people who desperately needed it.</p>
<p>The approach was callous – as well as hypocritical, since <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/health/dp-nws-virginia-lawmakers-health-insurance-story.html" target="_blank">many legislators participated in a low-premium, high-benefit state plan themselves</a>. A 2014 news account noted the state even covered more than 200 of these lawmakers’ dependents.</p>
<p>Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, allowed states to expand Medicaid beginning in 2014, and it required the federal government to pay at least 90% of the cost. Republican opponents claimed the feds could renege on paying its share in later years.</p>
<p>That argument was always dubious. For one, states rarely refuse federal funding based on the possibility Washington <em>might</em> cut off the spigot later.</p>
<p>It’s akin to telling an ailing patient that you won’t give him medicine now because it might lose potency in the future. So suffer in the meantime.</p>
<p>The GOP’s craven stance was revealed fully after Republicans nearly lost control of the state House in the fall 2017 elections. Polls at the time showed strong support for Medicaid expansion among Virginians.</p>
<p>The result: Many Republicans broke ranks in the state House in 2018. And four Republicans in the Senate did so, voting 23-17 for expansion. As I noted <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_5fa9c566-64db-11e8-89c8-234178a926b1.html" target="_blank">in a column that year in The Virginian-Pilot</a><u>,</u> Republicans “surmised the will of the people was finally worth following.”</p>
<p>This week, I tried to reach a couple of state senators who opposed expansion, including Tommy Norment, R-James City, who was Senate majority leader in 2018. Had they revised their opinions now that more of their constituents likely had health coverage?</p>
<p>My messages weren’t returned.</p>
<p>Some <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/affordable-care-act-expansion.aspx" target="_blank">38 states and the District of Columbia</a> have accepted federal funding to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. The dozen holdouts are primarily in the South, including Alabama, Florida, Texas and Mississippi.</p>
<p>The latter is the country’s poorest state, <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/MS,US/PST045221" target="_blank">based on its 18.7</a><a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/MS,US/PST045221" target="_blank">%</a><a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/MS,US/PST045221" target="_blank"> poverty rate</a>. A private foundation, <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/medicaid-expansion-mississippi-whats-stake" target="_blank">the Commonwealth Fund</a>, contends expansion in Mississippi “is a better fiscal deal than ever before, in addition to significantly increasing insurance coverage.”</p>
<p>As you’d expect, Republicans control the governor’s seat and both chambers of the state legislature.</p>
<p>In Virginia, as in the rest of the U.S., annual eligibility reviews of people on Medicaid were suspended during the pandemic. Reviews could resume as soon as October. Once they do, folks could lose coverage if their annual income exceeds limits, though some might have gained health insurance elsewhere.</p>
<p>What we know, for now, is more poor people in Virginia since 2019 have had better health care. They’ve had less stress. They’ve been able to use their precious dollars for other necessities. All because Medicaid was expanded.</p>
<p>NSS? That should now be obvious – even to the legislators who opposed changes to Medicaid.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Only once this century, over six presidential contests, has a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-States-Presidential-Election-Results-1788863" target="_blank">Republican candidate attracted more popular votes</a> than his Democratic opponent. That was in 2004, when incumbent George W. Bush narrowly took both the popular and electoral votes and won reelection.</p>
<p>Drop boxes for ballots, decried as a nefarious tool by Republican critics, didn’t cause major problems when many states increased their use during the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-2022-midterm-elections-covid-health-wisconsin-c61fa93a12a1a51d6d9f4e0a21fa3b75" target="_blank">according to an Associated Press survey of state election officials</a> released this month. “No cases of fraud, vandalism or theft that could have affected the results” were uncovered, the AP said. The findings were the same in both GOP- and Democratic-controlled states.</p>
<p>Given that the bar has gotten higher for Republican candidates to win the presidency and their claims that drop boxes harmed election integrity were debunked, the dilemma the party is facing nationally is clear. The problem isn’t that people are voting illegally on a large scale. It’s that Republicans have fewer avenues to win votes.</p>
<p>When you add <a href="https://www.facingsouth.org/2021/01/political-scientist-angie-maxwell-countering-long-southern-strategy" target="_blank">the enmity the party has shown for non-Whites over the past half-century</a> and the nation’s changing demographics, their situation becomes even trickier.</p>
<p>How have Republican state legislators responded? Have they modified their platform and outreach to African Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans? Have they asked why some voters prefer early and mail voting, and why drop boxes are so convenient?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>They’ve shown they don’t care a whit about evidence, including the absence of electoral wrongdoing. And they’ve revealed just how politically thuggish – and racially discriminatory – they can be.</p>
<p>States Newsroom, the national nonprofit that includes the Virginia Mercury, recently reported that since the 2020 election, 26 states have enacted, expanded or increased the severity of 120 election-related criminal penalties. Of that total, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/18/criminalizing-the-vote-gop-led-states-enacted-102-new-election-penalties-after-2020/" target="_blank">102 were enacted in 18 Republican-controlled states</a>.</p>
<p>Many of these new laws target voters, election officials or folks who help voters. Georgia’s Republican governor, for example, signed legislation criminalizing individuals who give food or drinks to voters waiting in lines at the polls.</p>
<p>So much for preventing your fellow Atlantan from passing out.</p>
<p>The Georgia law will have a huge impact on communities of color. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/why-do-nonwhite-georgia-voters-have-to-wait-in-line-for-hours-their-numbers-have-soared-and-their-polling-places-have-dwindled" target="_blank">ProPublica reported in 2020</a> that Georgia’s voter rolls have grown substantially since 2013, but polling locations have been cut by almost 10%, with metro Atlanta hit especially hard. The city’s population is 50% black.</p>
<p>These new laws followed then-President Donald Trump’s repeated lies about his Election Day defeat – including in Georgia. He <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/elections/2021/01/06/trumps-failed-efforts-overturn-election-numbers/4130307001/" target="_blank">suffered dozens of losses in court</a> nationwide trying to overturn the result.</p>
<p>Trump then incited an insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol. The attempted coup is now the focus of a select committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/07/26/trump-justice-investigation-january-6/" target="_blank">The Justice Department is also investigating Trump’s actions</a> as part of its criminal probe.</p>
<p>GOP legislators around the country might not have known all the details about Jan. 6 that the special committee has since publicized. They surely knew, however, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/biden-transition-updates/2020/12/01/940786321/barr-doj-has-no-evidence-of-fraud-affecting-2020-election-outcome" target="_blank">what then-U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr said shortly after the election</a>: The Justice Department hadn’t found evidence of widespread fraud that would’ve overturned the outcome.</p>
<p>Those legislators also knew Trump was – is – a serial prevaricator, and shamelessly so. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/" target="_blank">The Washington Post recorded more than 30,000 lies and misleading claims</a> he uttered during his four years in office, including more than 500 as he barnstormed the nation the day before the 2020 election.</p>
<p>“What is especially striking is how the tsunami of untruths kept rising the longer he served as president,” The Post reported, “and became increasingly unmoored from the truth.”</p>
<p>Many Republicans, if given truth serum, would admit they don’t believe most of Trump’s utterances.  They’re in fealty to him, though, because he has a huge base of voter support. Such is their profile in cowardice.</p>
<p>Something more, however – something unsavory, lazy and cynical – also spurs this glut of voting restrictions.</p>
<p>Republicans want to stay in power, at all costs. They fear the <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/ballotboxbarriers/analysis-voter-suppression-never-went-away-tactics-changed/" target="_blank">changing demographics of a country that’s becoming less White</a>, and where Republicans have often struggled to gain enough electoral votes to win the presidency. They’re in a party that has been traditionally inhospitable to people of color.</p>
<p>Thus, they make it tougher for non-Whites to vote, under the guise of “election security.” That scheme is easier to pull off than conducting a serious reexamination of your own party’s policies and rhetoric.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the vast majority of these laws are motivated by the conspiracies and lies about the 2020 election being stolen,” Jonathan Diaz, senior legal counsel for voting rights at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, told me this week.</p>
<p>“The real reason behind them is the overwhelming turnout in 2020,” he added, “particularly in communities of color.”</p>
<p>Diaz noted the clampdown on the ballot, particularly for the formerly disenfranchised, is nothing new: “Restrictions on voting that are racially motivated … are as old as the republic,” he noted.</p>
<p>Virginia, incidentally, made it easier to vote when then-Gov. Ralph Northam was in office and Democrats controlled the General Assembly. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/21/va-republicans-won-big-under-democratic-voting-rules-but-they-still-want-tougher-laws/" target="_blank">State Republicans then took the governor’s chair and the state House</a> in the 2021 elections under those laws.</p>
<p>Despite Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s flirtation with the issue of “election integrity” on the campaign trail, he’s backed off the subject while in office. As long as the state Senate remains in Democratic control, it’s doubtful major restrictions on voting will be reinstalled.</p>
<p>All the seats in the Assembly will be up for reelection in 2023, however.</p>
<p>Nationwide, Democratic-leaning groups must decide how to attack the undemocratic, Machiavellian tactics aimed at discounting or discarding their voice. They can choose disenchantment and isolation. Or they can choose large-scale, continuous demonstration and revolt.</p>
<p>Neither choice is desirable.</p>
<p>Nor is this blatant attack on the ballot box, built on a tower of lies.</p>

The project ultimately disintegrated in 2009.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/local/dp-nw-king-william-reservoir-land-20220724-tyklqpkpzfd4xoqvdzugcsdtc4-story.html" target="_blank">The city of Newport News has begun selling off the nearly 1,500 acres it acquired</a>, but at just a fraction of the $8.3 million it paid for the land with public money. The city spent a total of $51 million on the overall project.</p>
<p>Talk about taking a bath.</p>
<p>I was on the (Newport News) Daily Press editorial board from 1998 to 2000, when the momentum was still strong to build the the 12.2 billion gallon reservoir. The board was a vocal, steadfast supporter of the public works project, despite the numerous groups that lambasted it. The latter included the Mattaponi tribe, environmentalists and residents in the area.</p>
<p>Newport News Waterworks is the city-owned regional supplier of drinking water. A colleague of mine used to joke that agency officials loved visiting board members because we were some of the few friendly faces waterworks officials encountered back then.</p>
<p>Their pleas, though heartfelt, were very speculative: We desperately need this guaranteed water source for residents. New businesses won’t come here without it. Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>Looking back, I question whether my board colleagues and I were too dismissive of the legitimate concerns from detractors. They included the possible overestimates of water needed this century; the destruction of more than 400 acres of wetlands, which would’ve been the largest authorized in <a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/news/newport-news-scraps-the-king-william-reservoir/" target="_blank">Virginia since the Clean Water Act of the 1970s</a>; and the impact on cultural sites important to Native Americans.</p>
<p>Hindsight, you know.</p>
<p>As it turns out, energy-efficient appliances, like toilets, reduced water consumption. <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/article_ccc3e5be-b722-5986-b7cc-f86af653a31e.html" target="_blank">The opening of a desalinization plant</a> in the area in the late 1990s also helped. As The Virginian-Pilot just reported: “By the time the project ended in 2009, officials realized that the demand for water in the region was less than it had been in the late 1990s, according to waterworks director Yann Le Gouellec.”</p>
<p>The early estimates weren’t malicious, just wrong. Bureaucrats want to safeguard utilities as vital as drinking water, electricity and more. Besides, you can’t always predict the future from decades beforehand.</p>
<p>That’s important to recognize – for government officials and residents alike.</p>
<p><em>This story has been corrected to note that Newport News spent $8.3 million on the land acquisition. The remainder of the $51 million went toward project development costs.</em></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve been a cantankerous, rude, anxious bunch over the past 2 1/2 years, ever since the pandemic consumed us. That’s understandable – and not exactly news.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">news, and dangerous for anyone driving along highways in Virginia, are the number of shootings and other road-rage incidents plaguing those trips. We’re taking our personal traumas and stress out on anyone who gets within striking distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is all part of the nastiness and assault – on service employees, health-care workers and everyday folks – that exploded after March 2020. Family members of coronavirus patients  </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/13/bolster-our-dispirited-medical-workers-by-getting-vaccines-wearing-masks-being-unselfish/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">threatened doctors and nurses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Violent airline passengers </span><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/man-arrested-viral-attack-southwest-" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">punched or otherwise attacked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> attendants and ticket agents as the latter tried to enforce rules, often involving masks. School board meetings became textbook displays of ugliness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My part of the state, Hampton Roads, suffered </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-interstate-shooting-driving-20220708-4i5qaufbmjap3jog6b6nlzi3w4-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">three nighttime shootings on local highways</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> last week. No one was killed, but the Virginia State Police reported injuries. Earlier this month, a <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/07/04/vsp-seeking-information-after-man-was-shot-multiple-times-i-95-richmond/" target="_blank">shooting on I-95</a> in Richmond left a man seriously hurt and his car riddled with bullets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Corinne Geller, spokeswoman for the State Police, told me there has been a steady increase in freeway shootings over the past few years, from 47 in 2018 to 74 last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the start of 2022, State Police have reported 34 interstate shootings in the commonwealth, she said by email. The carnage included one slaying on Interstate 85 in Dinwiddie County in mid-April. Raeqwon C. Hinton, a 25-year-old Petersburg resident and </span><a href="http://www.orispjones.com/obituary/rae-qwon-hinton" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">music producer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, died in the early morning shooting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sgt. Michelle Anaya, spokeswoman for the agency’s Chesapeake Division, told </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/vp-nw-interstate-shooting-driving-20220708-4i5qaufbmjap3jog6b6nlzi3w4-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Virginian-Pilot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> she didn’t think the Hampton Roads freeway shootings were connected. She instead attributed them to an uptick in aggressive driving since the COVID-19 lockdown. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is very common now for troopers to pull people over for speeding in triple digits,” she told The Pilot. “In the past, every once in a while you’d get someone speeding over 100; now it’s three to four tickets a day for someone speeding between 100 and 130.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m amazed the speeders were even able to control their cars. They certainly didn’t care about anyone else who was on the road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among the shootings last week was one on I-264 in Portsmouth the night of July 6. A dark sedan pulled alongside the driver of another car and someone began firing. The driver who was shot at lost control, and his car ran off the roadway into the tree line at an off ramp, police said. The male victim suffered non-life threatening injuries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I write this, no one had been arrested in the three Hampton Roads shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is accelerating so much enmity and violence, often for strangers? An article in </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/03/antisocial-behavior-crime-violence-increase-pandemic/627076/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Atlantic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> this year suggested stress; increased consumption of alcohol and abuse of drugs; and lingering isolation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scott Debb, assistant professor of psychology at Norfolk State University, said being cut off suddenly in traffic or nearly avoiding an accident can trigger a fight-or-flight response in motorists. “Some people can calm down. There’s no immediate threat,” Debb told me. “Some people don’t do so great with that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s an understatement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The aggrieved can honk horns, raise the middle-finger salute, or spew venom at other people on the roadways. They’ll pursue other cars or slow down in front of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Debb said that since COVID-19, “People are in a differ mindset because of this global, shared” crisis. Add onto that the increasing political polarization, he added, and we’re rife for interpersonal conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bryan Porter is a psychology professor and associate dean of Old Dominion University’s Graduate School, and he’s studied driving safety for years. I’ve interviewed him plenty of times, often about </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_280cffb8-ecc3-5cc3-b7f2-7a4cfcfd9e3c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">red-light running</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When a recession occurs, roadway fatalities go down,” he told me Wednesday. COVID started that way, too. But what made COVID so surprising is the fatality rate “went up, not down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He contends that motorists should fear road rage less than other factors affecting safety. For example, seat-belt use in Virginia last year was just 81.7 percent, the lowest rate since 2016. (Porter is paid to collect the state data.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Put your phone down, Porter also advised: “Distracted driving is the next roadway pandemic. It’s a significant crash factor. It’s pernicious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Freeway shootings or intentional crashes aren’t new, obviously. I covered a road-rage slaying more than 30 years ago in Detroit. A teen riding with the 16-year-old victim on a city freeway said he didn’t know why the guys in the other car pulled alongside; one person then fired several shots, killing Raymond Brown. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, such incidents often draw outsized attention because they can be horrendous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m thinking of the </span><a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/feels-like-my-life-is-over-mother-of-6-year-old-boy-killed-in-55-fwy-road-rage-incident-speaks-as-family-offers-reward-to-help-catch-shooter/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">6-year-old boy shot dead in California last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> after his mother, Joanna Cloonan, flipped off a couple in another car. Her gesture came after the couple cut off Cloonan’s car. Police later arrested a man and woman in the slaying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now is the time for defensive driving. For obeying speed limits, keeping our middle digits to ourselves, and merging with reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’ve all been through a lot. We’ve had family members die. We’ve lost jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s chill the heck out when behind the wheel. And give wide berth to those who won&#8217;t.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Picture this scenario: A friend offers you a slice of scrumptious, calorie-laden, chocolate cake – no charge! You devour the cake, delighting in its sweet decadence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few hours later, long after you’ve discarded your plate, the friend demands you pay for the dessert you’d thought was free. He says he erred in calculating his costs, you see, and shouldn’t have been so altruistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something like that is playing out right now courtesy of the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/08/scathing-audit-faults-poor-management-for-virginias-unemployment-insurance-failures/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">much-criticized Virginia Employment Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Unfortunately for laid-off workers during the pandemic, the </span><a href="https://www.vec.virginia.gov/node/15201" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">VEC now wants money back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">its</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> errors in calculating payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are legally bound by federal directive to establish overpayments where benefits were paid improperly,” Joyce Fogg, a commission spokeswoman, told me by email. “ We are allowing individuals to apply for waivers if they are overpaid through no fault of their own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s understandable. How the VEC goes after the money, though, could use a lighter touch. A July 1 news release noted the Attorney General’s Office and an outside collection agency could be coming after Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A state law that expired June 30 had allowed the commission to suspend collection of overpayments. Virginia, by the way, is just one of 12 states that doesn’t have a </span><span style="font-weight: 400">permanent overpayment waiver provision, according to the </span><a href="https://www.nelp.org/publication/understanding-and-improving-overpayment-waivers-for-federal-and-state-unemployment-insurance-benefits/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">nonprofit National Employment Law Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But most folks in this category spent that money long ago. While out of a job and seeking a new one, they needed the cash for things like food, rent, utility bills and other essentials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m all for fiscal responsibility and recouping tax dollars, but c’mon: It’s highly unlikely those Virginians spent benefits recklessly during the (ongoing) </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic_gfx/&amp;state=VA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">COVID-19 crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. By the way, the feds have distributed $216.4 million to the VEC for pandemic-related operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Plus, given all the previous missteps, delays and screwups with the agency, jobless folks thought the agency had finally gotten its act together and issued the correct amounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If everything was approved, why am I being asked to repay?” noted Jessica Terry, a 40-year-old mother of four who lives in Hanover County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why, indeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Terry told me the VEC said she could be on the hook for $20,000 in overpayments. Terry, who recently divorced, homeschools her children, ages 6 to 15. She’s had trouble finding a new job outside the home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not including con artists or fraudsters in my plea for leniency. State and federal officials have seen their share of deliberate abuse of government funds since the pandemic began in early 2020. Those thieves deserve the prison time and fines that judges have meted out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scofflaws include a Pound man who conspired with others </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdva/pr/virginia-man-sentenced-conspiring-defraud-cares-act-unemployment-fund" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">to defraud nearly a half-million dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in pandemic-related jobless benefits; he got a federal prison term for his deceit. A federal court also sentenced a 31-year-old Jonesville woman in late 2021 for </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdva/pr/organizer-conspiracy-defrauded-cares-act-over-15-million-unemployment-benefits" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">defrauding the government of more than $1.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in a similar scheme. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m talking instead of </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/vec-resumes-collection-of-its-jobless-overpayments-seeking-859-million/article_49600ed9-d479-5de5-a782-c35011a2b3e5.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">nearly $860 million the VEC is targeting in more than 360,000 cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> since the pandemic’s onset. Almost 2 million requests for jobless benefits came in, swamping an already dysfunctional system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may recall the news stories. If you sought benefits as COVID-19 shut down businesses, you probably experienced the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/14/we-saw-unprecedented-frustration-general-assembly-advances-unemployment-insurance-reforms/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">“unprecedented frustration and failure,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as one state senator put it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Legislative auditors assailed shortcomings by management and poor oversight by the administration of then-Gov. Ralph Northam: </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/08/scathing-audit-faults-poor-management-for-virginias-unemployment-insurance-failures/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">inaction on increasing staff;</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> an IT upgrade years behind schedule; call centers where fewer than 3 percent of calls were being answered, frustrating laid-off Virginians desperate for state help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People who finally received payments, possibly after months of delays, assumed everything was good to go and each dollar OK to spend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Repayment won’t be easy for people like Terry: “It’s been extremely stressful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Attorneys who sued VEC for deficiencies last year and advocates for low-income Virginians say they understand the requirement to collect overpayments. “But there’s an open question about priorities,” Pat Levy-Lavelle, senior intake attorney with the Legal Aid Justice Center, told me Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lawsuit was eventually settled, with VEC promising to improve practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Levy-Lavelle noted thousands of Virginians are still seeking benefits. Others, he said, have faced average wait times of 10 months following an initial appeal to seek a higher-level decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Steve Fischbach is litigation director at the Virginia Poverty Law Center, another attorney in the suit. He thinks the VEC needs to tout the remedies for affected Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A lot of people applied for benefits in good faith,” he said. “But somehow they weren’t eligible to receive that money.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So why not issue more waivers – and better publicize the option? The agency told me it had approved more than 24,600 waivers totaling over $87.3 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Some individuals may be eligible for a state waiver – covering overpayments from both state and federal programs … that occurred during the benefit week starting March 21, 2020, through the week ending July 3, 2021, where the claimant is at no fault for the overpayment and requiring the overpayment is contrary to good conscience and equity,” Fogg noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Claimants with an outstanding overpayment balance are notified of the availability to make an application for the waiver by the VEC,” she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Customers with questions about billing statements should call the commission’s Benefit Payment Unit at 804-786-8593. I got through to an actual person on Thursday, thankfully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because if you were told you did everything right to get your slice of cake, you shouldn’t later face extra costs – or heartburn.</span></p>

I saw that up close <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_c2a2e94b-03fb-53d0-abaf-257a0a1032f2.html" target="_blank">when I rode along with sheriff’s deputies and police officers hunting down scofflaws</a>.</p>
<p>The debtors were frequently tens of thousands of dollars behind in payments.</p>
<p>Stakeouts, admonishments by deputies, and handcuffs were common that day in 2011. Jail was a possibility, but judges were often loath to leave dads behind bars if it prevented them from paying up. That would harm their offspring even more.</p>
<p>I was reminded about that reporting as Virginia begins sorting out what a post-Roe v. Wade society will become. Last month’s anti-abortion, anti-privacy, anti-women <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/24/u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a half-century</a>-old constitutional right.</p>
<p>Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/24/youngkin-vows-to-protect-life-as-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion/" target="_blank">wants to ban most abortions after 15 weeks</a> of pregnancy.  Democrats and abortion rights supporters pledged to fight back. The guv told conservative activists last week he wants to go even further if <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/29/youngkin-abortion-life-conception/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=675cbb27-4742-4343-958a-85e445ffd8af" target="_blank">Republicans hold onto the House of Delegates and flip the state Senate</a> in the 2023 elections.</p>
<p>Republicans now hold a slight majority in the House, 52-48. Democrats have an even narrower edge in the Senate, 21-19; the Republican lieutenant governor, Winsome Earle-Sears, would break tie votes in that chamber.</p>
<p>Fewer abortions will mean more children. Those infants will face a challenging future if both parents aren’t committed to their well-being and growth.</p>
<p>Youngkin, while trumpeting the chance to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/29/youngkin-abortion-life-conception/" target="_blank">“happily and gleefully” sign any bill</a> “in order to protect life,” must prove he also cares about children <em>long out of the womb</em> — when the stresses and costs of raising them become all too real for parents.</p>
<p>This issue will become even more critical if more women are forced to bring their pregnancies to term.</p>
<p>Here’s why this is important: <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ocse/2021_infographic_national.pdf" target="_blank">Some 20 percent of children nationwide</a> receive child support, federal officials say. Child support, when paid, nearly doubles the average income of recipients below the poverty line.</p>
<p>I spent several days interviewing a state legislator, Youngkin administration officials and a family and child welfare attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center about the commonwealth’s child support system. I also reviewed recent news articles.</p>
<p>Among the most notable points is the whopping amount of arrears that noncustodial parents in Virginia owe – and the fact that annual arrearages have gone essentially unchanged since at least 2013. The cumulative total was $3.15 billion at the end of most recent federal fiscal year; the amount has accumulated for decades.</p>
<p>Some caveats:</p>
<p>Not all the outstanding child support owed is due to the custodial parent. The state collects some funding in return for public money it pays for programs, said Valerie L’Herrou, staff attorney with the Virginia Poverty Law Center. They include foster care and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.</p>
<p>Officials put the debt owed the state at 13 percent, and the portion owed to custodial parents at 87 percent.</p>
<p>The $3 billion-plus isn’t an annual amount, of course. The unpaid support was $239 million for the 2021 federal fiscal year. The state’s Division of Child Support Enforcement collected more than $650 million in child support that year. (The older that arrears get, <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/ocsedatablog/2021/09/most-arrears-were-submitted-ocse-more-five-years-ago" target="_blank">the feds say</a>, the less likely officials will collect them.)</p>
<p>Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, sits on an advisory group that reviews child support guidelines. Among the challenges in collecting debts, he told me, is the lack of money and jobs for some parents.</p>
<p>“You can’t get blood from a stone,” Surovell said. “Typically, yes, they’re poor.”</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean every debtor is without fault. Attorney L’Herrou, by email, relayed anecdotes of fathers who changed jobs frequently or got paid “under the table,” making it difficult to track their wages.</p>
<p>“Also, many fathers act violently or retributively when they receive a summons for child support,” she added. “So many women avoid filing, or avoid seeking enforcement, for fear of the impact on themselves and/or children.”</p>
<p>When I rode with the Chesapeake deputies a decade ago, they told me one guy owed nearly $185,000 for at least six children. Some of his children had become adults by then.</p>
<p>The state assists parents to lower barriers to employment and promote “positive engagement with their family and children,” Barbara Lacina, director of the state’s Division of Child Support Enforcement, said through a spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Those services include helping with jobs, education, training and housing.</p>
<p>The agency also participates in a program to “provide more cost-effective enforcement alternatives to incarceration, maximize the potential for consistent child support payments by breaking the cycle of noncompliance, reduce jail overcrowding, and promote the involvement of noncustodial parents in their children’s lives,” Lacina said.</p>
<p>If employment and income aren’t readily available from the noncustodial parent, officials can find other ways to get support payments. This includes taking state and federal refunds, seeking orders to withdraw money from bank accounts and taking parts of lottery winnings.</p>
<p>Still, the amount of uncollected child support is virtually the same every year, officials said — within a range of $240 million to $250 million over a recent five-year period.</p>
<p>What will the governor do about the issue? “The governor&#8217;s health and human resources secretary is currently evaluating the best approaches to collect child support and strengthen families,” said Macaulay Porter, Youngkin’s spokeswoman.</p>
<p>I’m curious to see if something that hasn’t been done previously will be implemented. Maybe all the best practices have already been tried. We know millions of dollars, every year, aren’t getting to the children and families who need the money.</p>
<p>Surovell told me the division clearly needs more resources: “Most people who know would agree DCSE is not funded sufficiently.”</p>
<p>The state needs to make this a greater priority before it changes abortion laws.</p>
<p>Because if you want to reduce abortion, you also should bolster families — including our system of child support.</p>

<p>Defendants and prisoners sought him out after other lawyers rejected their cases. Coggeshall represented people who faced insanely long prison terms based on their crimes.</p>
<p>The 71-year-old Connecticut native, who died earlier this month from cancer, didn’t claim his clients were innocent. Rather, Coggeshall questioned whether the justice system was more focused on vengeance, and he spotlighted the inequity of the inordinate sentences.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_b8e8ba56-eb90-5ed9-861d-3a95fe270365.html" target="_blank">I wrote about one of his clients, Travion Blount, when I was a Virginian-Pilot columnist</a>. Then 15, Blount committed several crimes while at a house party in 2006. The teenager was sentenced to six life terms and 118 years for weapons violations.</p>
<p>His co-defendants, who were older, only got double-digit sentences.</p>
<p>As I wrote about Blount in 2013: “He&#8217;s one of several prisoners in the commonwealth sentenced to life without parole for a crime other than homicide and committed while a juvenile.”</p>
<p>Coggeshall won three conditional pardons on one day in 2018 from outgoing Gov. Terry McAuliffe. They included Blount and Lenny Singleton. All three are African-American — another sign of <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/young_lawyers/publications/after-the-bar/public-service/racial-disparities-criminal-justice-how-lawyers-can-help/" target="_blank">the disparate racial treatment between Whites and Blacks</a> in arrests and sentencing in America.</p>
<p>Singleton, for example, was sentenced by a Norfolk judge to two life terms plus 110 years in prison for a week-long spree of robberies. He stole a total of $550; injured no one; and was unarmed in all but one robbery — that time with a knife. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/05/us/mass-incarceration-drug-offenses-zero-tolerance-prisons.html?searchResultPosition=3" target="_blank">The Navy veteran and college grad</a> was addicted to crack at the time.</p>
<p>Singleton told me Monday, in an interview from Tulsa, Okla., he couldn’t fathom the harsh sentence after the crime spree in 1995 – the same year the commonwealth abolished parole. Singleton said he had thanked the detective after his arrest, because he knew he needed help.</p>
<p>Singleton’s wife, Vandy, had reached out to Coggeshall seeking his legal skills. She ended up working with him nearly a decade, assisting with pardon petitions.</p>
<p>“You’re talking about a great human being who cares, who fights for the little guy,” Lenny Singleton told me. Yet, “he didn’t want people to know how soft his heart was.”</p>
<p>Coggeshall would want this: <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/vp-nw-travion-blount-release-anniversary-20210226-gv24e4tbmzdr3bul2xzkmfmy2i-story.html" target="_blank">a return of parole in Virginia</a>. And a re-examination of the harsh sentences meted out by judges.</p>

The net gain is negligible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since this is the only planet we occupy, we should do better. Future generations will curse us for our sorry stewardship of the air, water and soil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First the good: Officials in Virginia Beach, the commonwealth’s largest city, are considering whether to enact a 5-cent tax on disposable plastic bags. The City Council could vote as soon as July on a proposal, </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/environment/vp-nw-wegmans-plastic-bags-20220619-3y7htwyd3fho5hoqvbxasxzhtu-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Virginian-Pilot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> reported. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/single-use-plastics-101" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Plastic bags take forever</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to break down. Fewer bags would mean less plastic debris in waterways, and reduce the harm to sea life and storm drains. It also would mean less plastic ending up in landfills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now the bad: Chesapeake, the state’s second-largest city, will end municipal-run curbside recycling on June 30. The decision will mean – for the first time in more than a quarter-century – public curbside recycling will cease in the city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, residents can sign up for “subscription-based” recycling services from private companies, costing $11 a month; it will cost even more to recycle glass. Or folks can schlepp their plastics, metal cans, paper and cardboard to about a half-dozen drop-off sites around the city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s no way the participation rate, now around 80 percent, will be anywhere close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I live in Chesapeake, and </span><a href="https://whro.org/news/local-news/28316-curbside-recycling-ends-soon-in-chesapeake-what-happens-next" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">several thousand of my neighbors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> had rallied against the pending switch since the city broached the possibility last summer. Some 70,000 households now use curbside recycling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Note to Chesapeake bigwigs: When something’s provided for free, or folded into the array of taxes that citizens already pay, you’ll have a difficult time convincing consumers to start forking over money for essentially the same service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s like newspaper websites giving away stories for free on the internet – sometimes for years – then demanding people pay for the same information later. </span><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/05/why-wont-some-people-pay-for-news/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">You shouldn’t be surprised when consumers refuse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trust me on this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fees on plastic bags mean there’s some hope on the environmental front. Since the General Assembly passed legislation in 2020 allowing localities to impose a five-cent tax on specific, disposable plastic bags, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/24/led-by-roanoke-virginia-cities-and-counties-begin-taxing-plastic-bags/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">several cities and counties have chosen to do so</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. They include some of the larger ones in Virginia: Fairfax County, Arlington County and Loudoun County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Officials and environmentalists hope the tax encourages people to bring their own reusable bags or use paper instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Beyond the litter and the unsightliness of it, the damage to our storm system and storm drains was probably the main driver,” Nell Boyle, sustainability outreach coordinator for the city of Roanoke, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/24/led-by-roanoke-virginia-cities-and-counties-begin-taxing-plastic-bags/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">told Sarah Vogelsong of The Virginia Mercury last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back to recycling. Officials in Chesapeake attributed their decision to end curbside pickup to costs, especially following higher fees from the private contractor; using some savings to fund pay increases for public safety employees; contamination of the materials in the bin; and the move by China in early 2018 to bar imports of recyclable materials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The latter was “a global game changer,” Earl Sorey, Chesapeake’s director of public works, told me this week. “The markets hit rock bottom at the time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He also noted a lot of what goes into the large, 90-gallon-plus carts shouldn’t be there. About 24 percent is trash. Some 18 percent is glass that’s ground up and used as cover at the regional landfill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So nearly half of the stuff in the rolling receptacle isn’t truly “recycled,” in laymen’s terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I get out all of that. Yet the message from city officials is the environment is less of a priority than services like public safety, roads and K-12 education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That may be the right ranking, especially given the changes in the global market. Sorey said the annual savings from ending curbside recycling will be around $2 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it’s a 180-degree turn from when Chesapeake began the program decades ago. The forerunner of the big-blue carts – 18-gallon tubs carried to the street – started in 1989, a Hampton Roads recycling official told me Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s what I used when I moved to the city in the late 1990s. Coming from Detroit, which only had a few volunteer-run drop-off sites, this was quite an improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nor do I get the city’s criticisms about the cost. Chesapeake is among the wealthiest localities in the state, with median household income of more than $81,000 and a 7.5 percent poverty rate. Census figures show the city outpaces the state on median income and is below Virginia’s poverty rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Be good stewards of the taxpayers’ money, by all means. Some services, though, should account for intangibles – like bettering our habitat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Have communities in Virginia ended recycling since 2018? Sure, according to a list compiled by </span><a href="https://www.wastedive.com/news/curbside-recycling-cancellation-tracker/569250/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wastedive.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which tracks waste, recycling and landfill news. The communities include Franklin and the town of Abingdon. However, those places are a fraction of the size of Chesapeake’s 251,000 residents – and of its wealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a matter of priorities, I suppose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our grandchildren, and their grandchildren, will be incensed by the decision to place budgets ahead of the environment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That metric, more than anything else, should guide how we assess the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/13/bipartisan-u-s-senate-deal-on-gun-control-met-with-praise-from-biden-democrats/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=e6140987-f151-4118-9cab-ff817d961987" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Senate’s bipartisan framework on gun control</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – and to a lesser extent, the competing bill that already passed the House of Representatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun-control supporters say the Senate measure does too little in the face of too much bloodshed. Gun-rights supporters, wary of more restrictions on their ability to own and use firearms, counter it does too much. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s clear is the status quo has failed. Tens of thousands of gun-related deaths each year – more than half of them suicides – are the proof. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal lawmakers are responding to the shared grief and outrage following the slaughter at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last month, as well as other mass killings nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been at least two decades since Congress has passed significant gun control legislation. Republicans, in thrall to the National Rifle Association and steadily growing right-wing gun culture that will brook no compromise, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/08/us/politics/gun-control-timeline.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have blocked reasonable measures for years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike previous attacks, </span><a href="https://www.insider.com/uvalde-doctor-details-horror-seeing-kids-bodies-ripped-apart-shooting-2022-6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the obliteration of 19 children and two teachers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on May 24 rattled inert congressional members. If only they’d done something sooner, like after the 2012 massacre in Newtown, Conn., maybe the insanity in Texas and elsewhere could’ve been prevented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, many large cities face a numbing, rampant body count every single week. It’s fueled by poverty, disrespect for life, and </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/24/we-must-do-something-to-stem-this-wanton-bloodshed/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">utter nonsense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Too many people use guns to settle mundane disputes. Black men are disproportionately victims and killers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten Republicans, nine Democrats and one independent crafted the Senate proposal. The concept lacks specific language for now, but its broad themes include providing funding to states to establish red flag laws; allocating money for school mental health and violence prevention programs; mandating those under age 21 to undergo a background check and curbing the illegal trafficking of guns called straw purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s two U.S. senators, both Democrats, said they favor the framework. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bipartisan proposal is a first and necessary step to reduce gun violence in our communities,” Tim Kaine said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it as far as I would have liked to have gone? No,” Mark Warner, through a spokesperson, said by email. “But the bipartisan plan … is an important step towards curbing the gun violence epidemic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will save lives.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia already enacted stricter gun provisions in recent years, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/13/what-virginia-changed-since-the-last-high-profile-school-shooting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">including a red-flag law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to temporarily seize guns from people believed to pose a threat to themselves or others,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and the restart of a limit on buying one handgun a month.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/12/us/politics/senator-gun-safety-deal.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. House version</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is more stringent than the Senate’s. Among its provisions, the House plan bars the sale of semiautomatic weapons to people under the age of 21 and bans the sale of large-capacity magazines. The bill passed on nearly party lines in the Democratic-controlled chamber, but it won’t overcome the 60-vote threshold to defeat a Senate filibuster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun-control supporters will criticize the Senate bill. A slight majority of Americans – I count myself among them – favor stricter gun laws, </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a Pew Research Center survey in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many will say the Senate version is insufficient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, it’s indefensible that assault-style weapons, used in many mass shootings, are so easy to obtain. They have but one purpose in the hands of civilians: to mow down people quickly and ruthlessly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The country banned them from 1994 to 2004, and “the number of deaths from mass shootings fell, and the increase in the annual number of incidents slowed down,” according to </span><a href="https://theconversation.com/did-the-assault-weapons-ban-of-1994-bring-down-mass-shootings-heres-what-the-data-tells-us-184430" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/michael-j-klein-1351591" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael J. Klein</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, clinical assistant professor of surgery at New York University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate version doesn’t change current laws on assault weapons, something President Joe Biden and most Democrats nationwide favor. </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Majorities of Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though, oppose policies creating a federal database to track all gun sales, as well as banning assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines holding more than 10 rounds, Pew Research said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What gun-rights supporters fail to admit is even Antonin Scalia – their sainted, late Supreme Court justice – acknowledged the efficacy of gun laws. He said so </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in writing the 2008 majority opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">District of Columbia v. Heller</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scalia noted about the Second Amendment’s individual right to keep and bear arms: “Of course the right was not unlimited, just as the First Amendment’s right of free speech was not.” He continued later, “ … [C]ommentators and courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gun Violence Archive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported more than 45,000 gun deaths last year; some 24,000 were suicides. </span><a href="https://www.healthdata.org/acting-data/gun-violence-united-states-outlier" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No other industrialized, wealthy nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of more than 10 million people comes close to our collective mayhem, nor our irrational tolerance for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve reported on gun violence in Detroit and in Hampton Roads. When I was on the police beat in the Motor City, annual homicide totals hovered around 600, an incredible number. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve covered too many killings motivated by drugs, or hubris, or romantic disputes. I’ve written about mass shootings at post offices and municipal centers, and massacres at dope houses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If guns weren’t involved, people might still die. If people – especially men – had only their fists, they’d think twice before rushing into an altercation. The death toll would be much lower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress must end the inertia. The Senate framework is no panacea, yet passage of the legislation would keep more people alive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And fewer people grieving the loss of loved ones.</span></p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)
</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">When The Boss and I stroll around our Hampton Roads neighborhood, we play a game that’s impossible to avoid. I call it “Dodge the Goose Crap.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Except we use a spicier moniker for “crap.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The droppings – and the Canada geese that generate them so prolifically – overwhelm roads. Unsanitary and unsightly, the fecal strips dominate sidewalks. If we shift to the street, cars and trucks invariably have smashed the poop into the pavement, flattening the feces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On a walk this week in Chesapeake, we encountered more than 40 Canada geese and their fast-growing goslings. As well as what they leave behind. They sat and grazed – and hissed when we got too close. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I therefore hold a dim view of the primary fowl that befoul our parks, ball fields, lawns, streets, retention ponds and creeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The same holds true for some folks around the country. The excrement from Canada geese has gotten so bad in one </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/04/us/canada-geese-killing-foster-city.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">California community that officials might authorize thinning the herd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The New York Times reported Foster City, near San Francisco, counted 323 resident Canada geese last year, up from 181 in 2020. Adult pairs can produce three to six offspring in a year, an official told me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Adult birds can unleash a pound of feces – yikes! – every single day. That’s a lot of piles and smashed waste. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mitigation efforts, including using dogs to scare them and annoying them with strobe lights, have been mostly futile in Foster City. Some animal rights activists and others don’t approve, but people living closest to the birds have had enough. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Virginia Beach a few years back, dozens of waterfront property owners had complained and petitioned for their removal. After the feds rounded up and euthanized more than 100 Canada geese, </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/environment/article_d1e994e8-05b9-59d9-aece-0dca168d0de0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">75 people protested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Protesters even placed a photo of a goose at a makeshift memorial. That was … bizarre. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The long-necked, graceful geese have become an unrelenting nuisance in parts of Virginia. It’s not all their fault: Development and other intrusions to their habitat contributed to the problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A federal law also protects them, though maybe it’s worked </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">too </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Migratory Bird Treaty Act safeguards Canada geese and many other species. An explainer from </span><a href="https://www.animallaw.info/intro/migratory-bird-treaty-act-mbta" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Michigan State University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> says Congress passed the 1918 law “to combat over-hunting and poaching that supplied the enormous demand for feathers to adorn women’s hats.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many Canada geese today, though, flourish. State and federal wildlife officials told me this week the birds have only a few predators, including foxes and raccoons. Residents can’t legally cull the birds before taking several other steps first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They’re so at home in some localities the birds squat in the middle of the road, ultimately straining the patience of motorists. They then take their sweet time waddling out of the way, instead of flying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From 1970 to 2010, resident Canada geese nationwide increased from </span><a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/wildlife_damage/2011/canada_goose_mgt.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">250,000 to 3.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, federal officials said. More recently </span><a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/7124540/canada-geese-extinction/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, citing the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Canadian Wildlife Service,</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> reported the number in North America had reached an estimated 7 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Birds formerly confined to mostly rural areas are popping up in urban and suburban communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Virginia, the number of resident Canada geese was at nearly 265,000 in 1998, officials say. The estimate in 2021, following euphemistically called “management actions,” was 177,000.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Individuals can try to rid the birds from their property using non-lethal methods, but it’s often a Sisyphean battle. Don’t mow grass near the edge of the water of your site, Ben Lewis, waterfowl biologist with the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources, told me by email. Geese like flat areas and access to water, so keeping the grass high can dissuade them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyone with a hunting license and the appropriate migratory waterfowl stamps can cull geese from Sept. 1 through Sept. 25 in areas that are open to hunting,” Lewis added. But that’s a brief period covering a finite amount of territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jeff Rumbaugh, staff wildlife biologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services office in Chesterfield County, told me residents can spread commercial </span><span style="font-weight: 400">repellents on their soil that irritates – but doesn’t kill – the fowl. This should drive them away – at least from you. Air horns and pyrotechnics are part of the recommended steps, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You also can get a permit to destroy their eggs and nests, using 100 percent corn oil on the eggs. Register with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at </span><a href="https://epermits.fws.gov/eRCGR/geSI.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">RCGR &#8211; Resident Canada Goose Registration Login System (fws.gov)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That, however, doesn’t solve the problem of the geese already here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rumbaugh’s agency will engineer a roundup if requested, but it wants to first ensure property owners have exhausted other steps. Officials will cull during the summer molting periods.

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walk into most stores, gather at sit-down restaurants, or chat with fellow Virginians, and the signs are as clear as the faces you can now see: We are so over the pandemic – even though it’s </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">killed more than 20,400 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and infected nearly 1.8 million in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These new, close-contact meetings make me wonder if we’ve abandoned caution too soon. That’s despite a top state health official’s guidance that the risk of infection and death has decreased substantially since COVID-19 began in early 2020. More on that later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My spider sense, though, is tingling following recent reports that new COVID-19 cases </span><a href="https://heraldcourier.com/news/local/covid-is-still-a-concern-as-cases-rise-60-in-the-past-week/article_77cb08a6-de05-11ec-b72d-831eac2da653.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">spiked in Southwest Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://godanriver.com/news/local/the-covid-19-surge-is-back-for-danville-pittsylvania-county/article_0a64c19e-e03a-11ec-8bdb-978183dbd6c9.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">south-central Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. An omicron subvariant is dominant in the state, officials said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/05/28/covid-memorial-day-surge/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Washington Post article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> noted the United States is recording more than 100,000 infections a day, at least five times higher than at the same point last year. In spite of that, The Post reported, many Americans are traveling around the country, celebrating graduations and weddings and venturing into bars and restaurants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Plenty of us have gotten vaccines and boosters, or even caught the virus and then recovered. (I’m in the former category – thank goodness.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the initial burst of antibodies from shots or infections fades after several months, an infectious-diseases specialist told The Post.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My completely unscientific, informal survey of grocery, hardware and other stores in my region reveals only 25 to 33 percent of consumers are masking up inside nowadays. I’m in the distinct minority when I don my mask and venture into the retail marketplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The unconscious goals of the pandemic seem to have shifted from the need for greater health awareness and setting health-motivated boundaries, to wanting more social interconnectedness and experiences,” Scott Debb, associate professor of psychology at Norfolk State University, and Marnee McClellan, a graduate student there, told me in joint emailed comments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where once health safety was paramount,” they continued, “the need for social connection, perhaps exacerbated by variables like the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) and the need to belong, began to overtake that goal.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trust me, I get it. We all want a return to normalcy, pre-March 2020. We want to mingle. We may have delayed parties, weddings and vacations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Business and government types are urging a return to office settings, including </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/youngkin-very-pleased-with-telework-response-budget-provision-seeks-answers-on-remote-work/article_45f47d88-4864-509e-801a-cd7f8a088d82.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gov. Glenn Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Some state employees have opposed restrictions on teleworking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I interviewed Dr. Colin Greene this week. He’s the new state commissioner of the Virginia Department of Health, though he’s been with the agency nearly five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Greene portrayed a tone at times both boosterish and optimistic, extolling the psychological virtues of meeting in person again and seeing each other’s faces – mask-free. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have moved a long way from 2020,” he noted, when there were no vaccines, no treatments and hardly anybody had natural immunity to the virus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since then, in Virginia, </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/covid-19-vaccine-summary/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">82 percent of the population</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> – or 7 million people – have gotten at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccines. Some 74 percent – 6.3 million – are fully vaccinated. More than 3 million have gotten boosters. Virginians have faced several waves of the virus, and some people have gotten immunity after being infected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The risk of death from catching the virus has decreased substantially, as has the risk of hospitalization” since 2020, Greene noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The restrictions instituted earlier had unpleasant, unintended consequences, he added – including closing schools and businesses, and the onset of social isolation. Mental health issues rose. “Nobody really wants to go back” to that, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The risk isn’t zero, Green cautioned, but “the benefit … from stricter prevention measures is just not that great anymore.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you haven’t already: Get the vaccines, and then the boosters when recommended. If you feel ill, Greene said, get a home test. If it comes back positive, isolate for five days. Wear a mask for five days after that when heading outside the home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you feel sicker, see a doctor or get to the hospital. Immunocompromised people and the elderly have to remain on guard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s only one side of the equation, however. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At some point,” Greene continued, “we have to go back to living our lives.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s a position states led by </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-delta-masks-vaccines/2021/08/11/639c6862-fa0c-11eb-9c0e-97e29906a970_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Republican governors touted months ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, when deaths nationwide were climbing quickly, and way before the levels of vaccination and immunity were this high. It was callous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So forgive me if I’m a mite skeptical of these new suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The push to return to pre-pandemic protocols has more legitimacy today, obviously. Greene noted every individual has his own risk tolerance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He’s right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Count me on the cautious side, even with the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/coronavirus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">seven-day average of deaths nationwide trending lower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. I’m humbled by the more than 1 million who have died across America since this horror started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ll still mask in public. I’ll still give you plenty of space when ordering a sandwich – which I’ll eat outside or at home. Repair techs will still wear masks when they come to my abode. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may think I’m crazy. Or maybe just prudent.</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one is shocked that Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears refused to say new gun restrictions are needed in the wake of the mass slaying at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last week. After all, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/05/25/virginia-lg-scheduled-to-speak-at-nra-fundraising-event-in-texas-this-week/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she posed with a military-style rifle in campaign mailers while running for office in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For staunch believers in gun rights, the firearms can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">never</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be the problem. Even if the cognitive dissonance is galling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earle-Sears, a Republican, addressed a women’s luncheon at the National Rifle Association’s annual conference in Houston. It’s in the same state where last week’s horror occurred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While decrying the deaths, she trotted out several red herrings to avoid blaming guns for the carnage. Among them:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We took prayer out of schools,” she said – even though students can still do so privately in public schools. Besides, the U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/796864399/exclusive-trump-to-reinforce-protections-for-prayer-in-schools" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned school-sponsored prayer more than a half-century ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; it’s not a new phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have emasculated our men,” Earle-Sears added – as if the 18-year-old man who killed 19 young students and two teachers could’ve even defined the word.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fatherless homes,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“countless Black men murdering each other,”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more were in her speech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are indeed societal problems. But so is the easy access to guns across the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/06/19/there-are-more-guns-than-people-in-the-united-states-according-to-a-new-study-of-global-firearm-ownership/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we have more firearms than people in the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s nothing to be proud of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRA, the premier gun rights organization in the U.S., </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/137269-national-rifle-association/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has donated the bulk of its $1.26 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia to Republican candidates and committees, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. The organization, its members and other pro-gun advocates hold vast influence with the GOP in Congress, thus ensuring gun-control bills rarely become law. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the case, even though </span><a href="https://twitter.com/nytopinion/status/1530942435932655622/photo/1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times on Sunday graphically noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how many mass shootings involved attackers who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">legally</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> obtained the firearms they used to kill, maim and cause immeasurable grief. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They included the assailant in Uvalde, who was eventually killed by authorities. He couldn’t even legally buy beer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A quote </span><a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/upton_sinclair_138285" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attributed to Upton Sinclair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes to mind whenever these mass shootings occur: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers know thousands of people die annually by gun violence. They know the NRA gives them buckets of money and holds sway with right wing voters. They know the group fights virtually every attempt at restricting ownership and usage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for Earle-Sears – and many other Republican politicians – it can never be the guns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t dare speak the name.</span></p>

The exhibits and photos taught us more about Joseph Jr., sometimes called “the forgotten Kennedy,” a young Navy pilot killed during World War II. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A video narrated by respected broadcaster Walter Cronkite relays how the family compound in the area served as a remote White House during JFK’s frequent trips there. The numerous Kennedy offspring, children of JFK and his siblings, ride horses in part of the footage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My wife and I were young children when JFK and Robert F. Kennedy were shot dead – the former while president in 1963, the latter while trying to secure the Democratic Party nomination in 1968.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was also struck, though, by a couple of incidents in a detailed timeline of JFK’s brief presidential tenure in the early ‘60s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In mid-1962, Southern segregationists </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/02/29/809740346/the-cruel-story-behind-the-reverse-freedom-rides" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">lured about 200 Black people North</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by bus, including to Hyannis. It was a cynical, mean-spirited scheme to protest Northern civil rights activists traveling South to integrate buses and bus terminals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Northern-bound Blacks were told jobs, housing and a presidential welcome awaited them. It was all a lie. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/us/politics/abbott-immigration-texas-dc-biden.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">in protesting the Biden administration’s immigration policies this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, has bused migrants from the border to the nation’s capital to try to sow chaos. The stunt has had mixed results.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The second event was the Cuban Missile Crisis, which thrust the United States and the then-Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. Those tense days in October 1962 ended </span><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/cuban-missile-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">when the Soviets agreed to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">remove the missiles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> after the U.S. promised not to invade Cuba, which it had tried unsuccessfully to do the previous year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, Russia has invaded its neighbor Ukraine attempting to seize the country. The United States and other allies have supported Ukraine with military and humanitarian aid – placing the two nuclear superpowers on a perilous course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The museum, thus, is a somber history lesson. And a distressing warning. </span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-5-2-1024x683.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin greets lawmakers at the Capitol as he arrives to deliver his first State of the Commonwealth address. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Former felons in Virginia, if they want to become better citizens, should be heartened. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gov. Glenn Youngkin just announced </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/20/youngkin-virginia-restoration-felon-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">he’s restored civil rights, including voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, to nearly 3,500 people since he took office in January. The move continues a less-cumbersome process initiated by his predecessors, both Democratic and Republican.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought it was amazing in five months that more than 3,400 people” got their rights back, Sandra Brandt, executive director of Norfolk-based STEP-UP, told me. The agency assists former prisoners from local, state and federal institutions with employment and other services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guv’s action is welcome – though he should’ve done even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Youngkin didn’t mount a public campaign urging fellow Republicans in the state House of Delegates, who control the chamber, to pass legislation amending the state Constitution. The change likely would’ve led to automatic restoration upon release, thus ending the current process in the commonwealth of rights restoration only decided by the governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a system that’s extremely rare among the 50 states, and it’s </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">among the most restrictive in the country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Only Virginia and a few other states require their governors to restore felons’ voting rights after individuals petition the change, according to a spokesman for the National Conference of State Legislatures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The procedure here dates to the </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_23caa5bd-c765-5102-8a6f-80c6bb6aca1e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">racist underpinnings of the 1901-02 state constitutional convention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, in which delegates dashed Black voting rights in Virginia with felon disenfranchisement, literacy tests and poll taxes. It was a quarter-century after Reconstruction ended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only felon disenfranchisement remains today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To amend the Constitution, the General Assembly must pass legislation two years in a row, with an election in between. Then the clause must win approval from voters in a referendum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The House and Senate, both under Democratic control, passed the legislation in 2021. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sj1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Senate passed its version this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, but the House – now with a GOP majority – </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/va-house-republicans-kill-felon-voting-rights-proposal-despite-bipartisan-support/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">killed the bill in a subcommittee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. That move prevented a vote by the full chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Youngkin, through his spokeswoman, declined comment about the amendment and whether he’d exhorted House Republicans to pass the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not surprised by the roadblock erected by the GOP. That doesn’t make it right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because Black and brown people overwhelmingly vote for Democrats, and are disproportionately represented behind bars, Republicans view easing the restoration process as helping their opponents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As an aside, people of color also </span><a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/un-report-on-racial-disparities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">are treated more harshly than Whites for the same crimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. As the </span><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/young_lawyers/publications/after-the-bar/public-service/racial-disparities-criminal-justice-how-lawyers-can-help/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">American Bar Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> noted: “The criminal justice system’s pervasive problems with racism start before the first contact and continue through pleas, conviction, incarceration, release and beyond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regaining the right to vote, holding public office, and serving on a jury or as a notary are ways of bringing convicts back into the mainstream. Such actions enable onetime felons to become more invested in their communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of that should supersede craven political calculations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am encouraged that over 3,400 Virginians will take this critical first step towards vibrant futures as citizens with full civil rights,” </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/may/name-933455-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Youngkin said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. “Individuals with their rights restored come from every walk of life and are eager to provide for themselves, their families and put the past behind them for a better tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s no argument about that. But if Youngkin truly feels that way, he should’ve used the bully pulpit to support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sen. Mamie Locke, sponsor of the legislation and a Hampton Democrat, applauded the restorations but criticized the governor’s lack of leadership. “He wants to be the sole decision maker in whether individuals have paid their debt to society,” Locke said by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She also cited Del. Karen Greenhalgh, who was a sponsor of the House version but voted against it in the subcommittee. The Virginia Beach Republican, a first-term delegate, didn’t respond to my requests for comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can only imagine what changed Greenhalgh’s mind – and whether veteran legislators influenced her once-bipartisan stance on the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Locke said she’ll continue to introduce the legislation so the state is no longer one in which there’s a “draconian process of the governor restoring the rights of citizens who have paid their debts to society.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The state annually publishes a list of pardons and other forms of clemency that’s sent to the General Assembly. The crimes that onetime felons committed, and the length of time it took for them to regain rights, are striking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many were guilty of nonviolent offenses decades ago. Others had drug offenses, yet they did their time and deserve a chance to do better. What you don’t find are a lot of convictions for rape, manslaughter or murder.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2022/SD2/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the most recent list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> published under then-Gov. Ralph Northam, ending Jan. 15, you can learn of the following people who regained their civil rights:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A man sentenced for larceny in 1996 in Fairfax County. A woman sentenced for a form of fraud in 1984 in Virginia Beach. A man sentenced for forgery in 1975 in Richmond County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A woman sentenced for LSD distribution </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">in 1972</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Virginia Beach. Heck, I was still in middle school back then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to reach several of the former felons to learn why it took them so long to try to regain their rights, or whether they had tried previously without success. None returned my calls or attempts to locate them on social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe they simply didn’t want to be reminded of their decades-old crimes. Or perhaps younger relatives don’t know about their past offenses and their time behind bars, and they feared new publicity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They shouldn’t have to ask the governor’s blessing to regain key rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Youngkin really wants to help disenfranchised felons, he can lead the charge to amend the state constitution. Sen. Locke, and many others, would appreciate the initiative.</span></p>

Jerry Falwell, the founder of Thomas Road Baptist Church and Liberty University. The school has been under scrutiny over its handling of sexual assault allegations.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p>Blaming the victims of sexual assault, rather than vigorously investigating men who are rape suspects. Dissuading women from filing criminal reports. Threatening academic and monetary sanctions against women for trumped-up violations of the moral code of conduct.</p>
<p>With such accusations being leveled repeatedly against officials at Liberty University – the private institution in Lynchburg known as a center for evangelical Christians – it’s fair to ask: Why would women feel safe on campus?</p>
<p>And why would parents allow their daughters to face a culture treating them with such contempt?</p>
<p>Rigorous reporting by the independent, nonprofit <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-liberty-way-how-liberty-university-discourages-and-dismisses-students-reports-of-sexual-assaults" target="_blank">ProPublica</a> preceded last week’s news that federal officials are investigating how Liberty handles sexual assault allegations. The U.S. Department of Education is probing whether the institution violated federal law by not adhering to the Clery Act.</p>
<p>That decades-old statute requires, in part, for colleges to inform students who report sexual assaults about the option of notifying law enforcement agencies, and to assist such reporting if needed.</p>
<p>Clery covers higher-ed institutions that participate in federal financial aid programs, and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/liberty-university-online-jerry-falwell-jr" target="_blank">Liberty students receive nearly $800 million</a> annually in aid from DOE, mostly through student loans. That figure was in the Top 10 nationwide in 2017.</p>
<p>I asked a Liberty spokesman for updated figures this week. He didn’t respond to that question – or others I’d asked about how the university handles sexual assaults.</p>
<p>The late, conservative televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr. founded Liberty in 1971. The university sits on 7,000 acres in Lynchburg. Some 15,000 students attend the central campus.</p>
<p>Liberty’s strict, 24-page student moral code, known as <a href="https://www.liberty.edu/students/wp-content/uploads/sites/89/2021/09/LW-11.29.2021-OCL-COMPLETE.pdf" target="_blank">“The Liberty Way,”</a> attracts many religious families. Sex outside “a biblically-ordained marriage between a natural-born man and a natural-born woman” isn’t allowed. The university prohibits alcohol, tobacco, pot and illegal drugs.</p>
<p>The code even dictates what’s acceptable clothing. For aquatics, for example, women are told they shouldn’t wear bikinis: “Swimming pool attire should be a modest swimsuit (one-piece swimsuit or tankini).”</p>
<p>Sanctions for various violations of The Liberty Way include dismissal or expulsion.</p>
<p>This would be harsh, perhaps even risible, for young adults at other colleges. But students at Liberty at least know the parameters when they decide to attend.</p>
<p>The code, however, shouldn’t be wielded as a club against women who say they’ve been raped.</p>
<p>Reports by ProPublica and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2021/07/20/lawsuit-claims-liberty-university-mishandled-sexual-assault-claims/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> indicate the onus is placed on the accuser, rather than the accused. Women who come forward are threatened with discipline if they attended events in which alcohol was being used – as if that was the worst thing that happened.</p>
<p>It’s a classic, anachronistic case of blaming the victim.</p>
<p>Way too often, women at Liberty are discouraged from reporting to authorities. Nor are they given the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>This means men on campus know they can get away with sexual violence. The atmosphere allows predators to attack, again and again.</p>
<p>Liberty officials, in a statement to ProPublica last week following the news of the federal probe, noted: “Liberty University welcomes the U.S. Department of Education’s review of our Clery Act compliance program.”</p>
<p>That response is noteworthy for its lack of information, or empathy.</p>
<p>In 2021, a dozen women sued Liberty, saying they were victims of sexual assault and misconduct. They contend Liberty didn’t help them and made the campus more dangerous. Among the problems, they described a suicide attempt and photo evidence removed from a report.</p>
<p>One plaintiff, a 15-year-old girl at the time, said she was mistreated by the university police department and threatened with filing a false report, according to The Washington Post. The plaintiff said she later learned her attacker was the notorious Jesse Matthew Jr., the complaint said.</p>
<p>Matthew was later accused of rape by another student at Liberty, the complaint said, and pleaded guilty in 2016 to the abduction and killing of Virginia college students Hannah Graham and Morgan Harrington.</p>
<p>Just last week, another student sued Liberty, saying the university failed to investigate her rape allegation and then retaliated against her for reporting it. <a href="https://www.jgllaw.com/sites/default/files/news/files/U.S.%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Western%20District%20of%20Virginia.pdf#:~:text=COMPLAINT%20On%20April%2027%2C%202021%2C%20Plaintiff%20Jane%20Doe%2C,complex%20called%20The%20Oasis%2C%20A%20Vue%20Student%20Community." target="_blank">The complaint</a>, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, says the Texas woman was raped and sexually assaulted by a fellow student in April 2021.</p>
<p>“Instead of ensuring Jane Doe’s safety, Liberty engaged in classic victim-blaming, compounding her trauma,” Erika Jacobsen White, one of the attorneys, told The Washington Post.</p>
<p>White, in an email to me, said the attorneys weren’t aware of any criminal charges being filed against the alleged attacker. “We believe the deficiencies in Liberty’s case are plain from the facts of the complaint and speak for themselves,” she replied.</p>
<p>The complaint says, in part: “Liberty failed to investigate the rape and assault, refused reasonable accommodations for the Plaintiff, was deliberately indifferent to Plaintiff’s sexual assault and injuries, retaliated against the Plaintiff, and perpetuated a hostile and dangerous environment on and around campus, culminating in Plaintiff’s suspension from the university.”</p>
<p>Statistics show that rape and other sexual assaults are woefully underreported crimes. Women, who overwhelmingly are the victims, often are beset by fear, humiliation and second-guessing.</p>
<p>Given those facts, all university officials should take such accusations seriously. Besides, such a response isn’t optional. It’s the law.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.liberty.edu/police/campus-safety-and-security/sexual-assault-awareness/" target="_blank">A Liberty webpage</a> on sexual assault awareness notes: “Only approximately 2 percent of all perpetrators will ever serve 1 day in prison.”</p>
<p>If Liberty officials don’t overhaul their approach, the percentage will never go higher</p>

(The death toll in America from COVID-19 is more than </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic_gfx/&amp;state=US" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">991,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, though the recent trend is positive. </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">More than 20,200</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Virginians have died since early 2020.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 12 children with a variety of serious illnesses don’t benefit from the administration’s posturing, either. They’re at a greater risk of catching COVID-19 – and possibly dying. These young people have cancer, cystic fibrosis, asthma and more. The issue is far from an intellectual one for them and their parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They gain nothing from the Youngkin administration’s <a href="https://wtop.com/virginia/2022/04/va-appeals-mask-ruling-for-12-immunocompromised-students/" target="_blank">harsh publicity stunt</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, this is all about scoring political points and making hay for the next election. Republicans Youngkin, Miyares and others in the administration seek total domination of the mask-optional initiatives. Even though they essentially have it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their message to the small handful of families trying to get their youngsters back in school safely? Pfft. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/virginia/vp-nw-virginia-judge-ruling-kids-20220324-53cn5i7sb5gf5hcxxygdw345rm-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">U.S. District Judge Norman Moon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> ruled in late March that the specific 12 students could ask their schools to mandate masking. The families, with the help of the Virginia ACLU and other groups, </span><a href="https://acluva.org/en/press-releases/parents-students-disabilities-file-suit-stop-youngkins-no-mask-mandate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">said the mask-optional policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> effectively kept their children out of school. That’s a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, they contend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Moon also took pains to note the executive order and state law remain in effect. As the Associated Press reported, families of other disabled children would have to make their own pleas for relief. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is not a class action,” Moon wrote, “and the 12 plaintiffs in this case have no legal right to ask the Court to deviate from that state law in any schools in Virginia (much less school districts) their children do not attend, or indeed even those areas of their schools in which plaintiffs’ children do not frequent.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That means the Youngkin administration and Miyares got practically everything they wanted. Nor do the school divisions have to grant the families’ requests for mandatory masking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered why Miyares appealed. His spokeswoman, Victoria LaCivita, declined to comment on “active litigation.” Nor did the attorney general’s website have any news on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I requested Youngkin’s reasoning for the appeal, his spokeswoman referred me to Miyares’ office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kaitlin Banner is deputy legal director for the Washington Lawyers’ Committee, one of the groups that assisted the 12 families of children with serious illnesses. She told me several of the students are back in school since Judge Moon’s ruling. She said he looked properly at the ADA and determined “that students have the right to attend schools safely.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One parent upset by the administration’s decision to appeal is Chris Seaman, who lives in Crozet and is the father of an 8-year-old boy fighting leukemia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s really a slap in the face, to be honest,” Seaman told me by phone this week. “We just want to be able to get our kids to go to school in a safe environment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seaman’s son and a younger sibling have attended Brownsville Elementary in Albemarle County. The third-grader has been learning remotely because he’s undergone chemotherapy, T-cell therapy and a bone marrow transplant over the years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But his family wants him to return. They have a meeting scheduled this week with school administrators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m hopeful they’ll be willing to give us the accommodation” that his son’s classmates and instructors wear masks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here’s what Seaman and his wife have done since their older son was diagnosed with cancer more than three years ago: There have been weekly, then monthly, trips to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, where the boy was in a clinical trial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The journey is five hours one-way. They’ve made the trip dozens of times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though their child is now in remission, Seaman said, he’s still taking several medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If he gets COVID, and he’s immunocompromised, he would be at higher risk for severe disease,” the father said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Parents in the local community have been supportive of the family. People have told him they’ll continue to mask, Seaman said, “and we’re grateful for that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His view of the state officials appealing Judge Moon’s ruling? “It feels like they’re deliberately targeting our kids,” Seaman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed. And for what?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miyares, Youngkin &amp; Co. should declare victory and drop the appeal. They’ve won their assault on mandatory masking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What they don’t want is for some of the dozen children to die from COVID-19, possibly spread by a classmate or educator. They would then have to explain why they were so adamant about their legal – and political – agenda on masks in schools. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why should anyone believe Alex Jones ever tells the truth? He’s an execrable conspiracy theorist, huckster of dietary supplements and vile tormenter of parents who lost children in the Sandy Hook massacre.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/nation-world/vp-nw-infowars-bankruptcy-20220418-fhbtsdvsozd5fnkqdri33s5yyu-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones&#8217; Infowars site filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently in Texas, delaying civil litigation while his business reorganizes its finances. He claimed Infowars, based in Austin, has assets of only $50,000 or less and possible liabilities of $1 million to $10 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Believe that if you want. Jones, a serial provocateur, has zero credibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s also made news in Virginia – most of it outlandish.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/judge-delays-alex-jones-trial-162351660.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Texas judge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week pushed back a trial over how much Jones should pay the Sandy Hook families, after Jones called the 2012 killings a hoax; 20 first-graders and six educators were shot dead. The violence was very real to the relatives who buried them, who wept for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The families said they were subjected to continued harassment and death threats because of Jones’ nonsense. The relatives already have won defamation lawsuits against him.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones, belatedly, said he believes the shootings occurred. And isn’t that special, given all the torment he helped unleash on those families in Newtown, Conn.? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked John G. Merna, a Virginia bankruptcy attorney, what the filings mean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The companies Mr. Jones put in bankruptcy either over-leveraged, meaning they took out too much debt, and revenues would not support payment of the debt and continue operation,” Merna said by email Thursday. “Or revenues dropped, thereby no longer supporting the existing debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Chapter 11 restructuring does not necessarily mean creditors don&#8217;t get paid. It does mean that Infowars and the other companies of Mr. Jones are seeking to reduce what they pay their creditors in order to continue operations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/august12/alex-jones-settles-unite-the-right-defamation-lawsuit/article_042e5c1c-ac6f-11ec-8816-bf61361681b0.html?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones settled a defamation lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for $50,000 filed by a witness of the 2017 Unite the Right car attack in Charlottesville. Former U.S. Foreign Service officer Brennan Gilmore had seen and filmed the deliberate crash that killed a counter-protester and injured others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilmore said Jones and others had spread conspiracies about him, leading to death threats against him and his family. Defendants including Jones and Infowars admitted defaming Gilmore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there was Jones’ stunt in early 2020, in which he traveled around Richmond in a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/local/infowars-founder-alex-jones-joins-virginia-gun-protest/2020/01/20/471b2ef6-fcde-4867-b229-085bdcf23b1a_video.html" target="_blank">what looked like an armored vehicle</a> and spoke through a bullhorn before a gun rights rally. He criticized the Democratic Party as “degenerate” and said rally supporters gathered “in defiance of the globalist tyranny and their attempts to trigger a civil war.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones deserves whatever condemnation – and financial judgments – are levied against him. </span></p>

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Norfolk’s top administrator wants to raise the minimum wage for municipal employees </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/local/vp-nw-city-wage-increase-20220417-i3ocyhs4zrf2ji7pjhwyp57fiq-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">by an eye-popping $6 an hour, to $18</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, in the budget year starting July 1. The city has more than 800 vacancies out of 4,844 permanent positions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesapeake, the state’s second-largest city, </span><a href="https://www.cityofchesapeake.net/Assets/documents/departments/budget/FY+2023/Proposed+Operating+Budget/City+Manager$!27s+Proposed+Budget+Presentation+Rev.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">would boost its minimum wage from $11.17 an hour to $15</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. It has roughly 4,000 employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not to be outdone, Richmond’s mayor wants to bump that </span><a href="https://rva.gov/press-releases-and-announcements/news/mayor-stoney-unveils-city-budget-fiscal-year-2023" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">city’s minimum to $17 an hour</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and provide a 5 percent salary increase to many workers. Some 95 percent of police officers and firefighters would receive at least a 10 percent pay increase under Levar Stoney’s proposed budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Businesses in the commonwealth already have made similar moves, going above the state’s current minimum of $11 an hour. They include institutions like </span><a href="https://www.userwalls.com/n/blue-ridge-bank-increases-minimum-hourly-pay-17-2358497/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue Ridge Bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which announced last year it had increased its minimum wage from $15 an hour to $17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t call this hiring binge “altruism” on the part of government and business leaders, however. Far from it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a necessity, as localities struggle to fill jobs during what we all hope – maybe foolishly – are the last gasps of the COVID-19 pandemic. New daily deaths have fallen recently, but the country </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_habit-bar-morning&amp;state=US" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">is still closing in on 1 million fatalities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> since the crisis started in early 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many communities either kept vacancies open, trimmed positions or reduced services. For example, Chesapeake, after a months-long hiatus, only recently restarted pickups of bulk household and yard waste. Residents had to pile up their dreck or haul it themselves to drop-off sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since employees left offices and jobs behind as the pandemic raged, a sizable number have never returned. They reassessed the traditional work-life balance, and folks crafted something new for themselves and their families. That’s a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result? Cities and counties around the state are </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089017/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Desperately Seeking (More Than Just) Susan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to provide essential services. They’re willing to pay significantly better than before, cough up </span><a href="https://www.norfolk.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=6030" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">four-figure signing bonuses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and offer enhanced benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Communities are trying to forgo rate increases to fund the additional employees. Norfolk, for instance, will pay </span><span style="font-weight: 400">for its hiring initiative “by the projected revenue growth across multiple sources such as real estate and other property tax revenues, sales, meals, hotel, and admissions tax revenue, and others,” Kelly Straub, a city spokeswoman, told me by email. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some 275 city positions in Norfolk are vacant now and pay less than $18 an hour – the proposed minimum in the fiscal year budget starting July 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">All of this means people, especially on the lower end of the wage scale, can flex their muscles and leverage a career in ways virtually unheard of in recent decades. It’s a dizzying time for laborers and employers alike. People can weigh what’s available and craft a better standard of living.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is happening during a period of low unemployment in Virginia – </span><a href="https://www.vec.virginia.gov/node/14494" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">just 3 percent in March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, less than the national average of 3.6 percent – and fewer people actively seeking work than in previous years. The situation also says something about how employers often ran roughshod over workers, simply because the latter had little clout to alter the landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How times have changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The employment market has evolved, and competition for employees is fierce,” </span><a href="https://www.norfolk.gov/DocumentCenter/View/70296/02-Budget-Message" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Norfolk City Manager Larry “Chip” Filer noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in his recent budget message. “We are feeling the crunch most acutely in positions that provide ‘core’ services. Job seeker expectations are higher than they were two years ago, and those expectations include going beyond higher pay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Vinod Agarwal is an economics professor at Old Dominion University and deputy director of its Dragas Center for Economic Analysis and Policy. He told me this week many local and state governments laid off employees when the pandemic struck, because they feared revenues would fall short. The lack of money didn’t always happen, though, because federal stimulus money helped fill the gaps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unemployment is now low in Virginia, he said, but the labor force outside the home also is smaller than pre-pandemic. Many people, including senior citizens fearful of catching COVID-19, left the job market; it’s not clear how many will return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The name of the game has changed,” Agarwal added. “You have to find out how to recruit workers and how to retain workers.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today’s job market also highlights the detestable falsehoods some business types uttered while enhanced federal unemployment checks kept people afloat. Some chambers of commerce officials blithely urged ending the </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/opinion/columns/vp-ed-column-stephens-mckenna-0530-20210529-a66j5us57nh7rigoybhxhkwere-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">$300-a-week payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> early because “essentially, not working is being subsidized.” Bars, restaurants, hotels and the like needed employees.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/06/04/theres-an-easy-fix-for-complaints-about-a-labor-shortage-cutting-benefits-isnt-it/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">The tone-deafness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of this tack was disgusting. Many who could apply for these jobs, shortly after COVID vaccines became available, would still risk catching the virus. The ones advocating the cutoff of stimulus checks could work remotely and remain safer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those checks ended in September. Yet, many public and private employers still struggle to fill vacancies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you’re on the sidelines, it’s a great time to re-enter the market. Employers are begging for you to return. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Make sure opportunity, aspiration and your desire all match. </span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/ Loudoun Times-Mirror)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s no revelation that many African Americans, in Virginia and nationwide, view the Republican Party as hostile to their aspirations and well-being. The news that a GOP electoral official in Hampton Roads hurled a racial slur at two Black military veterans, and blithely suggested a return to “a good public lynching,” reinforce the view of such enmity – if not outright violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gov. Glenn Youngkin and other Republicans quickly demanded David Dietrich, the electoral board chair in Hampton since January, resign following the recent publicity about his February 2021 Facebook post. The Hampton Circuit Court formally noted his resignation Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dietrich had verbally attacked </span><a href="https://www.defense.gov/About/Secretary-of-Defense/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lloyd Austin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, who served four-plus decades in the Army and is the nation’s first Black secretary of defense, and </span><a href="https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/lt-gen-russel-l-honore" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Russel Honore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, a retired Army lieutenant general who led the review of the U.S. Capitol’s security after the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Questioning their loyalty is both absurd and offensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Republican Party of Hampton, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/RepublicanPartyOfHamptonva" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">on its Facebook page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, expressed its outrage at Dietrich’s missive and copied the text of the disturbing 2021 post. Dietrich had said Honore was “a Black nationalist” and called the two men “enemies of the people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The electoral official then went on to describe both military veterans this way: “They are nothing more than dirty, stinking n&#8212;&#8212;s.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s how Dietrich distilled the essence of two men who, combined, spent three-quarters of a century serving in the military and defending this country. Among his military tours, Austin fought in Iraq. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As governor, I serve all Virginians,” </span><a href="https://twitter.com/GlennYoungkin" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Youngkin tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> April 9, before Dietrich had quit. “I won’t accept racism in our Commonwealth or our party. The abhorrent words of a Hampton Roads official are beyond unacceptable and have no place in Virginia. It’s time to resign.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some background </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/grebhandbook/2020-individual-chapters/2_Local_Electoral_Boards_(2020).pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">on electoral boards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: The political parties in a locality recommend nominees. The chief judge in the judicial circuit then selects the members. Usually, two members of the three-person electoral board are in the same party as the governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their duties include holding meetings, approving and recommending locations of polling places, and determining official results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not clear how the Hampton GOP learned of the 2021 Facebook comments. Hampton GOP Chairman Phil Siff declined an interview but referred me to a news release. In the statement on the Facebook page, the party said it “unequivocally condemns all forms of racism and bigotry, and specifically condemns the language employed by Mr. Dietrich.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Siff had told another news outlet: “It’s not acceptable behavior for someone who’s going to be in that type of position.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dietrich would have helped oversee elections in a city that’s 50 percent Black, yet he held these noxious views. Fortunately, no elections were held during his short stint on the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is no idle point, because some Republican officials around the country long questioned Joe Biden’s win after the 2020 presidential contest. Dietrich’s rantings were like-minded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Youngkin’s criticism was warranted and welcome. Nor am I suggesting every Republican thinks as Dietrich does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, the governor and other elected Republicans have too often employed racial tropes and outright lies, after calculating such strategies would drive their base to the polls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Racial reconciliation and equity be damned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Youngkin ran his gubernatorial contest claiming </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/12/20/can-youngkin-really-ban-critical-race-theory-in-virginia-schools/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">“critical race theory”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> was harming public education. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/01/20/youngkin-quickly-embraces-culture-wars-telegraphing-a-worrisome-four-years/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Conservatives had ginned up the catch-all phrase to incite their voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. The issue helped the political novice defeat Democrat Terry McAuliffe last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A Youngkin spokeswoman didn’t respond when I asked what the governor would tell Black Virginians who see the Hampton incident as more evidence the GOP is hostile to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The de facto head of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, used racial animus by Whites toward others even before his 2016 presidential campaign. He was, for example, the leading proponent of the </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-perpetuated-birther-movement-years/story?id=42138176" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">scurrilous “birther” movement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, saying Barack Obama wasn’t born in the United States – and thus ineligible to be president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following his failed bid for re-election in 2020, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/06/trumps-brazen-attempt-overturn-2020-election-timeline/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Trump and his minions lied repeatedly about voter fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Trump specifically cited heavily Black cities including Detroit, Philadelphia, Milwaukee and Atlanta as places </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/24/politics/trump-gop-minority-voters/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">he said the election was stolen from him</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a blatantly racist, stupefying attack. African-American voters have overwhelmingly supported the Democratic nominee for president for decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From 1968 to 2016, in fact, no Republican presidential candidate </span><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/why-are-blacks-democrat" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">received more than 13 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of the African-American vote; from 2000 to 2016, </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/320903/black-turnout-2020-election.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">the Democrat averaged a whopping 91 percent of the Black vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Biden won about </span><a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">90 percent of the Black vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">None of Trump’s claims on Black votes made sense – unless you don’t want those ballots to count.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African-American woman selected to the U.S. Supreme Court, faced a slew of disturbing questions from Republican lawmakers. The inquiries had nothing to do with her specific background or the job as justice. The senators also showed disrespect </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/600171-manchin-gop-treatment-of-jackson-disgraceful-embarrassing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">by repeatedly cutting off the nominee’s answers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> during this year’s confirmation hearings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alaska GOP </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/politics/murkowski-romney-ketanji-brown-jackson-scotus-vote/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Sen. Lisa Murkowski</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, one of three Republicans who voted to confirm Jackson, noted: </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/ketanji-brown-jackson-senate-confirmation-vote/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think there was a level of personal attack that was unwarranted.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back to the Hampton electoral board. Among Dietrich’s more-alarming comments was his shift to lynchings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Given the history of vigilante terror in this country, the statement was deplorable. </span><a href="http://archive.tuskegee.edu/repository/digital-collection/lynching-information/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Tuskegee University notes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> 4,743 people were lynched from 1882-1968; 73 percent of the victims were Black. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A more modern-day allusion? Someone built and erected a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2022/photos-jan-6-capitol/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">hangman’s gallows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> during the attempted reversal of Biden’s victory on Jan. 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The GOP, in Virginia and elsewhere, can continue to alienate large swaths of the public with divisive, biased tactics and rhetoric. The strategy has been partly successful for decades, though less so in an increasingly racially diverse country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Will the party shift to inclusion over expediency? Given the recent past, there’s no reason for optimism. </span></p>

(Photo by Graham Moomaw)</p><p>No one should speed in school zones. There’s precious cargo going to and from school buildings, and signs and flashing lights with the appropriate speed limit reminding motorists to slow down.</p>
<p>Chesapeake will now join several other localities in the commonwealth that lighten wallets if you don’t ease up on the accelerator. Think of it as a mutual dietary plan.</p>
<p>Virginia’s second-largest city this month will deploy 10 fixed speed cameras — with two additional mobile units — to monitor traffic around schools. Motorists traveling at least 11 miles per hour over the 25-mph limit will face civil fines of $100. A 30-day grace period will teach potential scofflaws what’s coming if they keep flauting the regulations.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to make it safe” for students, crossing guards and police officers, Chesapeake Police Officer Marc Lawrence told me. A one-day study found 2,000 motorists traveling at least 11 mph over the limit in just a single school zone, he added.</p>
<p>That’s unacceptable.</p>
<p>“So with numbers like that, it’s concerning,” Lawrence said.</p>
<p>Of course it is.</p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1442" target="_blank">A 2020 state law</a> allows localities to erect the cameras at highway work sites and school crossing zones.</p>
<p>Several communities in the state have since installed the cameras or approved them. They include the <a href="https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2021/12/09/altavista-police-install-automated-school-zone-speed-cameras/" target="_blank">Town of Altavista</a>, <a href="https://wtop.com/fairfax-county/2021/11/slow-down-fairfax-city-speed-cameras-near-schools-now-watching/" target="_blank">Fairfax city and county</a>, and <a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/fauquier-county-board-approves-ordinance-to-add-speed-cameras-to-school-crossing-zones" target="_blank">Fauquier</a> and Arlington counties. Motorists can contest the violation in court.</p>
<p>It’s not a moneymaking system, Altavista Police Chief Tommy Merricks told me.</p>
<p>“We want to calm traffic in the school zones,” he said, also noting the cameras can free up the 13 officers in the town of 3,400 to handle other duties. “We think this is an instance to work smarter, not harder.”</p>
<p>Private contractors, like Verra Mobility, often install the school-zone systems and are paid back through the fines the localities collect. The cameras are similar to those used catch red-light running, which snap photos of license plates after cars enter the intersection after the light changes red.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/red-light-running/red-light-camera-communities" target="_blank">Nearly a dozen localities in Virginia</a> already have red-light cameras, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety reports.</p>
<p>I slow my roll in school zones. I’d hate to hurt a child or someone protecting others because of my own carelessness or impatience.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean I’m always a saint. I’ve been cited three times by roadway speed cameras in the District of Columbia and adjacent Prince George’s County. The fines stung, even though I didn’t cause an accident.</p>
<p>I can complain about whether the speed limit should be higher on some thoroughfares — I’m talking about you, steep downhill stretch of Branch Avenue in Southeast D.C.! But the speed limits <em>are </em>posted and visible. The punitive approach teaches future compliance (at least for me it does).</p>
<p>Statistically, not a lot of crossing guards or officers have been killed or injured when you consider the thousands of schools across the country. The National Center for Education Statistics counted nearly <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d19/tables/dt19_105.50.asp" target="_blank">131,000 public and private K-12 schools</a> nationwide in the 2017-18 school year. The bulk, almost 87,500, were elementary schools, or those educating our youngest children.</p>
<p>Information provided to me Tuesday, by email, from the U.S. Department of Labor showed 45 people were killed from 2018 to 2020 while serving as crossing guards or “flaggers” at road and highway construction sites. Some 2,260 were injured over the same years.</p>
<p>Those are relatively small numbers, given the expanse of the country.</p>
<p>Still, for the individual families grieving the losses or dealing with long-term disabilities, most of these incidents were preventable. Police officials and news stories often cite driver inattention (think smartphones and eating), speed, and recklessness as the principal culprits.</p>
<p>Go back even further, and you uncover cases like that of <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/article_d11ce857-4027-5661-8290-3509f618b67d.html" target="_blank">Lovette Person</a>, a 35-year-old crossing guard struck and killed in Chesapeake in 2011. She was in uniform, wearing reflective gear and using a flag and whistle. The wife and mother was friendly and known as a comedian and <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/transportation/article_231bb7dc-66a7-50da-959b-863d150be02f.html" target="_blank">fond of giving nicknames</a> to the young charges she looked over.</p>
<p>The defendant pleaded guilty to improper driving — she was originally charged with reckless driving — and was fined just $250.</p>
<p>Other crossing guards have been killed or injured more recently nationwide, according to news reports.</p>
<p>Ashley Dias, 45, was killed and a child injured when a SUV struck them in Lafayette, California, last year. <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/09/09/update-crossing-guard-at-lafayette-school-fatally-injured-on-duty-hailed-as-hero/" target="_blank">Witnesses told a TV station</a> there the SUV was headed for a group of students when Dias pushed one child out of the vehicle’s path but was dragged under it. <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/12/10/charges-filed-by-contra-costa-da-in-death-of-school-crossing-guard/" target="_blank">Prosecutors later filed</a> misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter charges against the driver.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/maryland/video-shows-crossing-guard-protecting-student-get-hit-by-car/65-d7bb40db-b5d4-42f0-b932-d41e89cdc331" target="_blank">Then there’s the harrowing video</a> of a police officer who was injured in February in Cecil County, Maryland. Cpl. Annette Goodyear threw a student out of the way as a car was barreling down. Goodyear survived the accident and later returned to the job. The local sheriff’s office cited the motorist for several violations, including negligent driving.</p>
<p>If the traffic cameras can prevent accidents like the ones I’ve described, that’s a good thing. The shutterbugs — carrying the threat of penalty — will make us more cognizant of the students and adults crossing the roads.</p>
<p>We’re supposed to slow down, anyway.</p>

(Roger Chesley / The Virginia Mercury) 
</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">One city’s decades-old water “drought” may finally be over. Its mayor just announced local officials will finally build a public pool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Forgive the residents of Chesapeake, though, if they don’t rush out to buy bikinis, swimming trunks and inner tubes. Since the city’s founding </span><a href="https://www.cityofchesapeake.net/Visitors/history.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">more than a half-century ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, promises about swimming pools have been made and broken. The commonwealth’s second-largest city, population just a tad under 250,000, has had its share of belly flops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet hope springs eternal: Mayor Rick West, at last week’s annual </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AumiHyQ04hU" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">State of the City address</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, credited local legislators for seeking $9 million in budget amendments to help fund an indoor pool – one of the city’s capital priorities. Chesapeake would have to pay for the rest, with the total at perhaps $15 million, the mayor told me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be built on land next to an existing library-recreation center in a low-income area: The Clarence Cuffee Community Center had previously been mentioned as a possible site for a pool. The time from groundbreaking to opening could take a few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is an opportunity for kids in that area to have something,” said Del. Cliff Hayes, a Chesapeake Democrat and former City Council member. “It’s a shame it’s taken so long.” As a child growing up in Chesapeake, he had to hop on his bike and head to a Norfolk center to learn how to swim. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chesapeake residents have sought a public pool </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_a81f12c7-7308-5f98-8926-1a589a109140.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">since at least 1973</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Their pleas have usually led to excuses, instead of splashes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">West was a little reticent this week to discuss the project, since the funding is tied up in the state’s budget negotiations. Lawmakers will be back in Richmond starting April 4 for a special session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mayor was less hesitant to extol the proposed pool’s benefits. It would teach residents in an underserved area how to swim. The pool also would entice people to visit that community more frequently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That changes the expectations,” West said. “It shows to the rest of us this is an important place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Placing the pool in the Campostella neighborhood also is evidence to African Americans that the city will provide better opportunities and equity for all. Such issues gained renewed attention after the slaying of George Floyd in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">West credited the New Chesapeake Men for Progress and Chesapeake Coalition of Black Pastors for keeping the issue in the forefront. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He’s been open to hearing and listening and being a part of the city leadership addressing issues,” said Bishop Kim W. Brown, who heads The Mount, one of the more activist churches in Chesapeake. Brown said top city officials have been meeting quarterly with the Black pastors group, of which he is a member, over the past couple of years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We don’t have a city pool that can accommodate the practices for high school swimmers,” added Clifton Randolph, president of the New Chesapeake Men for Progress. “It would make Chesapeake a better place to live and work. So it would make it better for all the citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve been accused of killing many trees by advocating in The Virginian-Pilot, my former employer, for Chesapeake to build a public pool. I plead guilty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In late 2015, </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_a81f12c7-7308-5f98-8926-1a589a109140.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrote a two-part series on the issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. I noted that among the nation’s 100 most populous cities, Chesapeake was one of only two without a public pool. (The other was Fremont, Calif.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Learning how to swim prevents drowning, is a lifelong type of exercise, and provides training for jobs on the water. Not to mention that swimming is easy on the joints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Public pools are a great place to get that experience. Sure, you can apply for a membership at your local YMCA or private club, but many families can’t afford it. Municipal pools have much lower rates, and they welcome everybody. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Residents in Chesapeake have been disappointed before, especially since the start of this century. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Early proposals for the Cuffee Center, which opened 15 years ago, had a pool. It was never built. The City Council in 2011 rejected a major, costly overhaul in a local park that would’ve included an Olympic-size pool. It probably would’ve drawn youth swimmers to tournaments from nearby states. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/columns/article_573fd5b5-5162-59d8-8091-813b5eff7fd2.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">A more-recent proposal at Cuffee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, about a half-dozen years ago, fizzled before getting much traction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Will there be complaints that the state is funding a local project? Possibly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, major appropriations of state money often have gone to localities. Several are amenities that improve the quality of life and lift up people. Del. Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach and chair of the House Appropriations Committee, told me Wednesday of a few:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Chrysler Museum in Norfolk. The Virginia Aquarium in Virginia Beach. Gun violence prevention in Portsmouth. Razing decaying buildings in communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’ve given lots of money to lots of local museums and special projects” in certain jurisdictions, Knight said. &#8220;It’s not unprecedented to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The timing of this year’s request by Chesapeake is serendipitous, since the state has an infusion of cash. </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/budget/Budget-Conferee-Letter-03.04.22.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration projects the excess revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> across three budget years is $14 billion.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said God is working things out the right way,” Mayor West noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is the pool essential? Debatable. Will it be an asset to Chesapeake? Definitely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s decades past due for the city. It will bolster the community. That’s a role the state should want to support. </span></p>
