(Scott Yates for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia’s booming data center industry is driving unprecedented energy demands, straining the state’s natural gas infrastructure and prompting calls for new pipelines. A Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) report warns that expanding pipeline capacity may be necessary to meet the surge, bringing with it additional logistical and environmental challenges.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some efforts to expand pipeline capacity are already underway. In October, Williams Companies filed an </span><a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20241029-5076&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP), which would add about 55 miles of pipeline — mostly in Southwest Virginia — to the existing 10,000-mile Transco Pipeline stretching from Texas to New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This follows the company’s </span><a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20231116-3071" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approval </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year for its Commonwealth Energy Connector Project in Southside, designed to link in Greensville County with the Columbia Gas Virginia Reliability Project. That initiative, now under </span><a href="https://www.whro.org/environment/2024-07-19/construction-begins-on-pipeline-expansion-in-hampton-roads#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will deliver natural gas to the Hampton Roads region, addressing growing energy needs in that part of the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southgate extension project, an effort to extend the Mountain Valley Pipeline from Pittsylvania County into North Carolina, began consultations with the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality this year for permit reviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, Balico, the Herndon-based developer previously associated with the canceled Atlantic Coast Pipeline, proposed a massive data center campus with 84 buildings and an on-site natural gas plant for power. However, strong community </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/04/data-center-proposal-in-pittsylvania-withdrawn-for-now/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forced the company to scale back its plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Atchie, director of community and project outreach for Williams Companies, emphasized the importance of the  SSEP, which seeks to expand natural gas infrastructure across Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It ensures that infrastructure exists to support the rapid economic and population growth in the southeast,” Atchie said, adding that it also meets the region&#8217;s growing demand for stable and reliable energy to heat homes and power essential services.”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent pipeline developments have drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups, who warn about the potential impact on waterways the projects may need to cross and the continued reliance on carbon-emitting fossil fuels. Scientists link these emissions to worsening climate change, including more frequent and intense storms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically, we&#8217;re looking at two co-located projects,” said Jessica Sims, a field coordinator for Appalachian Voices. “You have two projects, co-located in Pennsylvania County, approximately [that] could be built at the same time.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Southeast Supply Enhancement Project</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams Company plans to add about 55 miles of pipeline in Virginia and North Carolina through a series of loops —  parallel pipes designed to increase carrying capacity along existing lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the Eden Loop would include about 30.8 miles of 42 inch-diameter pipeline running from Pittsylvania County into Rockingham County, NC. The loop also includes two 33,000-horsepower electric-powered compressor stations, in addition to others in North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41587" rel="attachment wp-att-41587"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41587" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project.jpg" alt="" width="1055" height="818" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project.jpg 1055w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project-300x233.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project-1024x794.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project-768x595.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams has requested approval for the project by February 2026, with an in-service date set for Nov. 1, 2027. Among the gas recipients are the City of Danville and Southwest Virginia Gas, which would take 1,500 and 5,000 dekatherms, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without new capacity, there is a risk of repeating past shortages and power outages,” Atchie said. “The expansion taps into established pipeline corridors to minimize environmental and landowner impacts and will be built and maintained using Williams’ industry-leading safety standards, including 24/7 monitoring and rigorous maintenance.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Southgate extension</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SSEP pipeline is planned to follow a similar route  to the 31-mile Southgate Extension project, which Mountain Valley Pipeline announced last </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/02/mountain-valley-proposes-shrinking-southgate-extension/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would be reviving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the company has engaged with federal and state regulatory agencies, including the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), to discuss the permits required for the project’s revised scope, spokesperson Shawn Day said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Sims of Appalachian Voices raised concerns during a State Water Control Board meeting last month about Virginia code provisions that allow the DEQ to waive the requirement for a Section 401 permit under the federal Clean Water Act if the pipeline is below 36 inches. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37341" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/26/the-feds-extended-the-deadline-for-the-southgate-pipeline-extension-heres-a-refresher/mountain-valley-pipeline-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-37341"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37341" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Mountain Valley Pipeline right of way and some piping is visible beside Rt. 460 Sunday, July 16, 2023, in Elliston. (Scott P. Yates for the Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised plans reduced the Southgate pipeline from 75 to 31 miles, eliminating the need for a  controversial compressor station, but increased the pipeline diameter from 24 and 16 inches to 30 inches, still under the threshold allowing the DEQ to waive the need for a water permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The cumulative impacts from two major construction projects is one reason to give South gain more scrutiny than last time,” Sims told the board, pointing to its proximity to the SSEP project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked by the Mercury if the DEQ would waive any permits for the Southgate Extension project, DEQ spokesman John Giese said the agency has not received formal plans. “Southgate/Equitrans has informed [the] DEQ of their intent to move forward on a project and has discussed their general layout and timing of design,” Giese said. “However, no formal plans or permit application(s) have been submitted to [the] DEQ for review.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is aiming to be operational by 2028, “to provide PSNC Energy and Duke Energy with an affordable, reliable and resilient natural gas supply to meet residential and business demand and generate electricity,” MVP Southgate spokesman Day said, adding the project &#8220;will secure all necessary permits and authorizations.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Balico’s data center</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC report highlighted natural gas as the most viable option for onsite power generation, a necessity for many large-scale projects in Southwest Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of the current technologies available, only natural gas appears viable for on-site generation, and it can be deployed only close to pipeline infrastructure that has sufficient capacity to serve generation needs,” the report stated.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41586" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1313px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41586" rel="attachment wp-att-41586"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41586" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center.jpg" alt="" width="1313" height="854" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center.jpg 1313w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center-300x195.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center-768x500.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1313px) 100vw, 1313px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A engineering plan for the data center campus and onsite power generation source. (Courtesy of Pittsylvania County)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pittsylvania County, Balico initially proposed a 2,300-acre data center campus with a 3,500-megawatt natural gas plant, but withdrew the plan after significant community pushback. In November, the company submitted a scaled down </span><a href="https://www.pittsylvaniacountyva.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/5911/638678889658570000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a project requiring “more than 760 acres” and </span><a href="https://www.pittsylvaniacountyva.gov/government/departments/upcoming-zoning-special-use-permit-applications/-folder-407" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rezoning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> land for “private electric power generation,” with a letter of intent from Mountain Valley Pipeline owner, EQT, “for the supply of a sufficient volume of natural gas to fuel the power plant proposed for the campus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal is expected to be reviewed next year. Nearby, the town of Hurt passed a </span><a href="https://www.chathamstartribune.com/news/local/article_df6b1e6c-b26d-11ef-9744-4f2fedf60454.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supporting the project, agreeing to provide 2 million gallons of water per day through the construction of  a new water plant. Community opposition to the original proposal had largely centered on the water demands of the project.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a new presidential administration taking office in January, Gov. Glenn Youngkin expressed optimism about potential fiscal benefits for Virginia, even as Democratic lawmakers voiced concerns about looming challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am so looking forward to having a period of tailwinds that will come out of Washington,” Youngkin said Wednesday following his budget proposal presentation in Richmond, signaling confidence in President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has indicated plans to bring back the 2017 corporate tax cuts, raise tariffs on imported goods, and cut federal jobs, sparking debate among Virginia lawmakers over potential impacts. Discussions also touched on federal Medicaid cuts, which could significantly affect the state’s healthcare funding.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking during a joint session of the General Assembly’s money committees, Virginia’s Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings mixed corporate income tax trends, noting that while refunds tied to corporate tax payments were slightly up, corporate tax revenues are down by $177.4 million compared to the same time last year. Cummings cited an uptick in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/08/15/youngkin-taxes-corporation-refunds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate tax refunds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a contributing factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve actually built in on corporate income tax a very conservative corporate tax view, reflecting some of the things that have taken place to date,” Cummings said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin defended tariffs as a way to ensure “America gets good deals first with our adversaries,” noting that the policy, first implemented by Trump during his first term, has continued under President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I am seeing as a result of the discussion around tariffs is a literal line of businesses that want to invest in America, and particularly in Virginia,” Youngkin said, though he did not provide specific examples. “I think we’re going to see another level of growth here in the commonwealth as a result.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit think tank, projects that while tariffs </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-revenue-estimates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between $2 billion and $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034, they would also increase the cost of goods. This could result in an average annual tax burden of $1,253 to $2,045 per U.S. household over the same period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, expressed concerns over the broader application of tariffs compared to previous policies, which were more focused on China. “That’s a distinct difference from 2016 when it was more targeted on certain countries,” Hayes said. “Now we’re hearing about a more broad application.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings defended the previous tariffs, arguing that they contributed to economic growth despite targeting basic goods like steel and aluminum, which have widespread effects on manufacturing. “I don’t think you can really separate the two,” Cummings said, referring to the different types of tariffs being proposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, Democrats have touted improvements in the economy, pointing to a steady decline in inflation since its pandemic-era peak. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by another 0.25%, attributing the move to favorable economic conditions resulting from current policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon-King, D-Prince William, raised concerns about the potential economic impact of federal job cuts, which would disproportionately affect Northern Virginia, home to a significant portion of the state’s federal workforce. A George Mason University analysis released before the election </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/trump-government-cuts-could-cost-house-republicans-majority-.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that eliminating 100,000 positions could result in an annual loss of $27-28 billion for Virginia’s economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s very definitely on the radar screen,” Cummings said, acknowledging the potential effects of such “very aggressive actions” on Virginia’s more than 200,000 federal workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings noted that while federal jobs represent a small percentage of Virginia’s 4.2 million workers, their loss would still be felt. ”It’s not insignificant, but it’s not huge,” he said, adding that the private sector could potentially absorb displaced workers, given Virginia’s low 2.9% unemployment rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, expressed concerns about the potential for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal cuts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Medicaid expansion program’s funding match, emphasizing the importance of maintaining coverage for Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s an incredible benefit to having all Virginians insured,” Favola said, noting the link between health insurance and workforce participation. “I would hope the administration would be very amenable to continuing, at a minimum, our policy of insurance remains as many Virginians need insurance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings assured lawmakers that the state is prepared for potential Medicaid funding challenges. “We have fully provided for all the liabilities that we know of around Medicaid, and built in growth in our five-year plan.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin presents his proposed amendments to the state's biennial budget before a joint meeting of the Virginia General Assembly's money committees in Richmond on Wednesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the cusp of his last full year in office, Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping budget proposal that he hopes will define his legacy as Virginia’s 74th governor. Focused on tax cuts, infrastructure, education, and public health, the plan sets the stage for what could be a high-stakes 2025 legislative session as lawmakers weigh his ambitious priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We reopened Virginia’s economy after a global pandemic all while delivering surplus after surplus,” Youngkin said during a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees in Richmond. “Virginia is growing, Virginia is leading, and Virginia is winning. And this morning I ask you to join me in continuing that work together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized the state’s strong economic performance, pointing to job growth, corporate investment, and robust revenue increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The stock market is strong, and the Federal Reserve appears poised to reduce interest rates over the next year,” he said. “This backdrop further supports Virginia’s ongoing strong performance, with year-to-date revenues up 7.3% over 2024.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlighting more than $5 billion in tax cuts already delivered to Virginians over the last three years, Youngkin proposed additional measures to lower the cost of living. “Together, the commonwealth can make a clear statement that reducing tax burdens so Virginians can keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets is not a Republican idea, it’s not a Democrat idea, it’s just common sense,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cornerstone in Youngkin’s proposed revisions to the two-year budget is a renewed push to eliminate the locally imposed personal car tax, an issue that he first came to embrace earlier this year after two Democrats campaigning for legislative seats in Southwest Virginia </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/10/13/two-virginia-democrats-embrace-a-former-republican-governors-signature-policy-eliminate-the-car-tax/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of their platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car tax has been a Republican rallying point since 1997, when GOP gubernatorial nominee Jim Gilmore successfully campaigned on repealing the unpopular levy. However, without a clear plan during the 2024 legislative session, the proposal quickly fizzled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, Youngkin once again urged the General Assembly to abolish what he called Virginia’s “most hated tax since the tax on tea” that he said cost the average Virginia family of four about $290 annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Standing here today, I will renew my call for us to work to fully eliminate the car tax, but recognizing that this might not be possible in this short session, there is an incremental step that we should take together to provide additional car tax relief,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new proposal, the state would deposit $1.1 billion into a car tax credit fund to provide income tax rebates to nearly 1.9 million taxpayers earning up to $50,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals or $100,000 for couples filing jointly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible taxpayers would receive up to $150 for individual returns or $300 for joint returns annually for the next three years. After the fund is exhausted, the state would see a permanent reduction of $360 million in tax revenues each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also is asking the legislature to extend the standard deductions for state income tax returns — currently set at  $8,500 for individuals and $17,000 for joint filers — that are set to expire at the end of next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to make the standard deduction permanent before Jan. 1, 2026, would result in tax increases of $57 million in fiscal year 2026 and $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2027, the governor said. “My friends, there is no reason to raise taxes on Virginians. We are running surplus after surplus after surplus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers responded cautiously to Youngkin’s budget plan Wednesday, emphasizing the need to review the details before committing to any initiatives. With the legislative session set to begin in January, both the House and Senate are preparing to roll out their own budget amendment proposals, signaling potential negotiations ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our focus will remain on targeted investments that benefit all Virginians,” said House Appropriations Chair Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William. “We will explore how we can work across the aisle to ensure K-12 schools are fully funded, higher education is accessible, and affordable housing becomes a reality for more families. These are areas where we can and should find common ground.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, in a statement thanked Youngkin for presenting his budget and for “initiating this important conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, our responsibility is to evaluate these proposals thoughtfully and collaboratively to ensure they reflect the priorities of all Virginians. We can craft a budget that strengthens our schools, supports our communities, and provides real solutions for working families,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate’s president pro tempore, said that while her chamber will consider his proposal, the Democrats’ amendments will look different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Senate budget will provide relief to working families and individuals and invest in their education and well-being, while maintaining the commonwealth&#8217;s long-term fiscal health,” Lucas said. “Here in the Senate, we look beyond elections and talk-show appearances and budget for the long-haul.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other key initiatives in Youngkin’s proposed budget amendments:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘No tax on tips’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration is also proposing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/16/youngkin-pitches-tax-relief-for-tipped-workers-in-budget-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to eliminate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state taxes on tips for service industry workers, a policy similar to one championed by President-elect Donald Trump. If approved, the measure would allow tipped workers to claim a deduction on their state tax returns, with compliance monitored through IRS data and employer-reported W-2 forms. The proposal could benefit an estimated 250,000 Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has an incredible hospitality, restaurant and service industry, and hardworking Virginians should keep every penny of the tips they earn through their exceptional service. My proposal is very simple — no more taxes on tips,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the move is being framed as a win for workers, its broader implications remain unclear. Economists warn that some employers might exploit the policy by shifting more of a worker’s compensation to tips rather than wages, a concern </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-and-harris-say-theyll-kill-taxes-on-tips-how-would-that-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also raised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around similar federal legislation. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is proposing nearly $1 billion in new education funding, including a $50-million Virginia Opportunity Scholarship Program to provide $5,000 annual grants for private school expenses like tuition and transportation. About 10,000 K-12 students from families earning up to twice the federal poverty limit to qualify for free school meals would qualify, with funding coming from revenue growth, not existing education budgets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan includes $25 million for lab school partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities and nearly $500 for higher education capital projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is no new funding for college operating expenses, and Youngkin is pushing for a 2.5% cap on tuition increases. “It’s time for our colleges to cut administrative bloat and handle costs without asking taxpayers for more,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional proposals include $290 million for school construction, $550 million in direct aid, $6.8 million for school resource officers, and $50 million to support underperforming schools. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">VMSDEP</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/jlarc-review-of-vmsdep-no-evidence-of-peak-or-decline-in-participation-levels/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(VMSDEP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides tuition waivers to spouses and children of military members killed or permanently disabled in service, would receive $60 million from a surplus in the state’s 529 college savings program to address a funding shortfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers scrutinized the program last year after it was initially excluded from budget negotiations. Concerns over its sustainability arose as participation surged by nearly 350%, growing from about 1,400 participants in 2019 to about 6,400 in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allocation would come without any new policy proposals.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Withholding funds to quash ‘sanctuary cities’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin further echored national Republican rhetoric by declaring that “every state has become a border state” as he unveiled plans to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-wants-to-restrict-funding-for-localities-that-dont-comply-with-immigration-enforcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to localities that limit or refuse compliance with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal aligns with a broader GOP push against “sanctuary city” policies, which vary but often involve local governments choosing not to inquire about immigration status or declining full cooperation with ICE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Virginia’s legislature under Democratic control, this proposal is expected to face significant opposition during the upcoming budget negotiations.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boosting maternal health outcomes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Democratic lawmakers are prioritizing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their legislative and budget </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/17/in-bipartisan-push-virginia-lawmakers-target-rural-healthcare-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increasing the chances that some measures will make it through budget negotiations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s plan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-unveils-plan-to-improve-maternal-health-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes $2.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for perinatal health hubs, expanded funding for OB-GYN residencies, and a $500,000 education campaign to help parents recognize life threatening conditions like heart attacks or eclampsia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also proposes $1 million to support workforce development for midwives and doulas, both crucial professions in addressing care gaps and advocating for patients, particularly those of color impacted by racial health disparities. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mental health support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia enters its third year of its Right Help, Right Now initiative, Youngkin’s latest budget request includes </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/meet-people-where-they-are-special-teams-aid-va-s-efforts-to-expand-mental-health-care-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$35 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve crisis response involving law enforcement. The funding would support hiring </span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/licensure-and-regulatory-affairs/special-conservators-peace" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special conservators of the peace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or “s-cops,” as Youngkin calls them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These intermediaries would assist with individuals awaiting hospital admissions after mental health crises, aiming to de-escalate situations where people in crisis might unintentionally harm  officers and face jail time. Youngkin envisions the “s-cops” fostering better outcomes for those in crisis while allowing law enforcement officers to focus on their regular duties.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disaster relief</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration proposes allocating $127 million toward a permanent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disaster relief fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to aid victims of natural disasters beyond what the federal assistance, insurance and private donations cover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southwest Virginia has faced repeated flooding in recent years, most recently from Hurricane Helene in September, which claimed three lives and caused $4.4 billion in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/va-dept-of-transportation-estimates-hurricane-helene-debris-cleanup-will-take-3-to-6-months/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Youngkin said $25 million could come from the general fund, with $102 million sourced from the latest round of revenues of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had previously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/20/judge-deems-youngkins-actions-to-withdraw-virginia-from-rggi-unlawful/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sought to withdraw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia from RGGI, despite praise from environmental groups for its funding for flood resilience and energy efficiency programs. “I fully expect that the General Assembly will work constructively together in this next short session to appropriate funds specifically for Hurricane Helene relief,” he said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, questioned the governor’s proposal, pointing to his approach of using RGGI revenues. “Why not just put us back in RGGI?” she asked, while noting uncertainty about the fund’s legislative support.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t know yet,” she said in an interview. </span></p>

(Courtesy of Commonwealth Fusion Systems)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia could soon make history as the home of the world’s first nuclear fusion power plant, state officials and private sector leaders announced Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a fusion power company founded in 2018 in Cambridge, Mass., unveiled plans to build the groundbreaking facility on a 100-acre site at James River Industrial Park in Chesterfield County. The plant, expected to generate 400 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 150,000 homes — could be operational by the early 2030s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Commonwealth Fusion Systems plans on building the world’s first grid scale commercial fusion power plant in the world, full stop, and it’s going to be right here in the commonwealth of Virginia,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said at a presentation of the undertaking at Richmond’s Patrick Henry Building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional nuclear power plants that rely on fission, fusion replicates the energy-producing process of the sun, offering a cleaner and more sustainable power source. The project, which would occupy about 25 acres of the site, signals Virginia’s growing role in shaping future energy solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement comes as Virginia’s energy needs are surging, driven by the rapid growth of data centers that power big tech operations. These facilities consume enormous amounts of  electricity and water to process and cool computer systems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report from the nonpartisan Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission (JLARC) released last week found that energy demand from data centers could triple from about 10,000 megawatts today to about 30,000 megawatts by 2040 if infrastructure, like new transmission lines, were already available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s two largest utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, are already exploring small modular nuclear reactors to meet rising  energy demands, with Dominion also investing in offshore wind, solar and natural gas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fusion power offers another path to clean energy, avoiding emissions that scientists link to  climate change and its increasingly intense and frequent storms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fusion technology works by combining hydrogen isotopes — deuterium extracted from water and tritium from lithium — under extreme heat and pressure, using powerful magnets to fuse the elements. The process generates heat, which boils water to create steam that spins a turbine, producing electricity. The byproduct is helium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our customers’ growing needs for reliable, carbon-free power benefits from as diverse a menu of power generation options as possible, and in that spirit, we are delighted to assist CFS in their efforts,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Dominion Energy Virginia President Edward H. Baine, in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFS selected the Chesterfield site after conducting a global search. The company will lease the land from Dominion Energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To secure the project, Virginia offered $1 million from the Virginia Energy Clean Energy Innovation Bank, $1 million from Chesterfield County, and a sales and use tax exemption for the plant’s equipment. The company has also received U.S. Department of Energy funding. Youngkin said the project would bring “billions” in economic development and create “hundreds” of jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFS is currently building its </span><a href="https://cfs.energy/technology/sparc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPARC demonstration plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Massachusetts, a project that will pave the way for the ARC technology planned for Chesterfield. While the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California achieved a major milestone in 2022 by demonstrating fusion using lasers, CFS employs a different approach. Their technology relies on a donut-shaped device called a tokamak to confine and fuse molecules.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41547" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2000px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/cfs-arc-powerplant-2000px/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41547" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px.jpg 2000w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A rendering of the ARC donut shaped tokamak technology. (Courtesy of Commonwealth Fusion Systems)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You won’t need a pipeline to bring the fuel in, or a smokestack for the exhaust,” said CFS co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Bob Mumgaard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike fission, which splits heavy atoms like uranium to produce energy — and leaves behind radioactive waste — fusion creates energy by fusing light atoms, explained Alex Creely, CFS director of tokamak operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the big advantages of fusion is that it doesn’t produce any long lived waste material, and there’s no risk of some kind of meltdown event,” Creely said. “It&#8217;s a very safe energy source — something that you can live right next to and feel very comfortable with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said in a statement Tuesday that he will introduce legislation to define fusion energy in state code. The energy source would be allowed as &#8220;zero-carbon electricity&#8221; under the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law aimed at  decarbonizing the state’s electric grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since the VCEA’s passage, we have succeeded in driving energy innovation in the commonwealth, and today marks another important step in what has been a remarkably successful effort — a step that would not have been possible had Virginia declined or abandoned the opportunity and responsibility it took to lead in clean energy,” Sullivan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized that the project will be financed entirely by CFS, with no cost passed on to Dominion Energy ratepayers. The facility will operate as an independent l power producer, selling its electricity to specific customers through power purchase agreements or directly into the regional PJM Interconnection market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a reasonable hypothesis that the growth in data centers in Virginia will very happily take the power that is generated at this plant,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41546" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2000px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/cfs-arc-facility-front-2000px/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41546" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px.jpg 2000w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Another rendering of the Commonwealth Fusion Systems proposal for Chesterfield County. (Courtesy of Commonwealth Fusion Systems)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preston Bryant, senior vice president at McGuireWoods Consulting, which was involved in the site selection process, said Virginia was chosen in part because the Nuclear Regulatory Commission determined  months ago that fusion technology does not require a federal license like fission and can instead be approved at the state level.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project will still need several state permits, including a radioactive materials license from the Virginia Department of Health, and a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">certificate of convenience and public necessity from the State Corporation Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristen Cullen, vice president of global policy and public affairs at CFS, said additional approvals may include an air permit from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality for backup generators during emergencies and potentially a storm water discharge permit, depending on the site-design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryant noted that it was “a coincidence” that the selected site was initially chosen by Dominion for a proposed natural gas plant before the utility relocated that project to the nearby, former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement followed discussions with  local environmental groups, which expressed some support for the project, but also raised questions about its impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Considering rising energy demand in Virginia driven by data centers and that most folks in the environmental world are not in support of more gas infrastructure, SMRs or hydrogen energy, this seems like a promising solution, if and when it actually comes online,” said Melissa Thomas, senior organizer with Mothers out Front, a climate advocacy group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas also raised questions about whether the plant’s backup power would rely on gas-powered systems or electric alternatives.</span></p>

Solar power growth is expected to help some parts of the country meet electric demand this summer. (Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New rules for building solar energy projects on prime Virginia farmland and forested areas are part of the ongoing  solar siting discussion in the state and are drawing ire from solar developers but support from the farmers and the forestry industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules, known as House Bill 206 regulations, stem from </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB206#:~:text=The%20bill%20specifies%20that%20a,adverse%20impact%20on%20natural%20resources." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed in the 2022 session that established the legal determination that solar projects generating up to 150 megawatts would have an adverse impact and require mitigation if they were built on more than 10 acres of prime farmland, and 50 acres of contiguous forested land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime farmland is critical to the agricultural industry in Virginia because of its rich soils that help crop growth. Forests provide wildlife habitat, capture carbon from the air and soak up floodwaters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law seeking to decarbonize the grid, mandates that Dominion Energy build about 16,100 megawatts of solar power and Appalachian Power Company build 600 megawatts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the general rule of thumb being that one megawatt of solar needs about seven acres, the potential development of solar has rural communities fuming over projects taking away their cherished landscapes and contributions to the agricultural and forestry industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill was meant to try and strike that balance,”  Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, said during a panel discussion at the Virginia Clean Energy Summit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past five years, about 2,400, or 3%, of the 97,000 acres of prime farmland lost annually has been taken up by solar, with other types of development making up the difference in losses, according to the Department of Environmental Quality. About 7,730 acres of forest has been lost over that period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed rules are the culmination of two stakeholder groups’ </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/20/state-work-group-on-solar-development-unable-to-reach-consensus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discussions </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">over the past two years. DEQ is reviewing the comments and is expected to finalize them early next year.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the rules call for</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules largely follow a 1:1 mitigation ratio for the two types of land, meaning that for every acre that is disturbed on-site, developers must take mitigation steps to conserve that amount on- site or off-site, including paying for easements that prevent development to protect the same type of land in nearby areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of mitigation needed can change depending on certain steps taken during development. One example would be a developer not changing the grade or slope of the land, which can alter how much erosion occurs from water running off of the panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitigation requirements can also be reduced by limiting soil compaction in order to help the land return to agricultural production at the end of a solar facilities’ typical 30-year lifecycle. Incorporating </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/18/dominion-energy-pairs-solar-with-honey-bees-to-preserve-agricultural-land/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agrivoltaics </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and preserving riparian forest buffers can also prevent erosion along waterways and soak up pollutants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disturbance of C1 or C2 forest corridors, which are recognized as having enhanced wildlife and environmental benefits, do require increased mitigation measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very clear as to what has to be mitigated, but it says nothing about how to mitigate those impacts, so we looked at the different tools,” said Jonathan Rak, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief policy advisor at DEQ.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Conflicting comments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar developers see the rules as being costly, while agricultural community members support the requirements to preserve land for Virginia&#8217;s top economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulations “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overlook solar&#8217;s substantial economic contributions, including thousands of jobs, millions in tax revenues, land-lease payments, and significant capital investment in Virginia,” wrote Marshall Conrad, with the North Carolina-based solar developer Strata Clean Energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups, including the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, submitted comments voicing similar concerns, saying the easement costs “could easily exceed $2 million at larger facilities,” and could push developers to a lengthier approval process at the State Corporation Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But other environmental groups, like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Virginia Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts, supported or wanted to strengthen the rules because of the potential harm solar development poses to Chesapeake Bay cleanup goals, which includes planting trees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Utility scale solar projects are therefore impairing Virginia’s ability to meet its environmental obligations to the Chesapeake Bay region,” Scott Cameron, second vice president of the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District, wrote in comments sent to the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the agricultural front, the Virginia Cattlemen&#8217;s Association pointed to the concern that about 500,000 acres of all types of Virginia farmland have been lost over the past five years as reason to support the rules to keep farmland in production. And the Virginia Forestry Products Association voiced similar worries over the loss of trees, but noted a potential unintended consequence of 500 acres of forestland being lost to solar development, and another 500 acres of land going under an easement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The potential net effect of this type of mitigation is instead of sawmills losing 500 acres for future harvest, we have lost 1,000 acres if truly commercial timber harvesting is in any way discouraged under these easements,” wrote the Virginia Forestry Products Association.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disturbed lands</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid using farmland or forested areas, many have suggested developing solar projects on previously mined land that’s already been disturbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Virginia Energy, there are 125,000 acres of that land available, though some if it is remote with limited distribution lines, has rocky terrain that could be challenging to build on and could be used for economic development projects aimed at revitalizing the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think there&#8217;s a balance there of looking at what locations are better suited for some types of development,” said Daniel Kestner, economic development program manager at Virginia Energy.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission released its long awaited <a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt598-2.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> on data centers Monday, detailing the expected soaring energy demands and large economic benefits of the industry ahead of the 2025 General Assembly session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents and activists have been clamoring throughout the past year over  projections that energy demands could triple by 2040, which JLARC said could lead to a $37 monthly bill increase for Dominion Energy Virginia customers. But at the same time, the industry provides about $9.1 billion in annual activity to the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, Northern Virginia is the largest data center market in the world, ahead of Beijing and London.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also presents three suggestions for the tax exemptions the state currently offers data centers. The exemptions could be “extended to maintain data growth and economic benefits, allowed to expire to slow growth and reduce energy impacts, or modified to balance those priorities,” explained Mark Gribbin, JLARC’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief legislative analyst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the release of the report, Youngkin, in a statement to the Mercury, signaled a desire to strengthen the industry’s presence in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get serious, embrace common sense, growth, and opportunity, and keep Virginia winning,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report’s modeling to meet increasing energy needs includes the use of new natural gas plants, which release climate changing emissions and harmful pollutants to the surrounding community, to provide reliable power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has a simple choice: embrace all of the above and deliver affordable, reliable, and, yes, increasingly clean baseload power to support future economic growth, while taking advantage of the billions of dollars in capital investment, high-paying jobs, and local and state tax revenues that come from data centers,” Youngkin said. “Or bend the knee to a green energy agenda and give away Virginia’s leadership position.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report is in line with a recent regulatory filing from Dominion Energy stating annual increases in electric power demand would be relatively flat, if it weren’t for data centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modelling from E3, a third-party consultant, showed that energy demand for the state would increase from just over 10,000 gigawatt hours in 2023 to just over 30,000 gigawatt hours by 2040, if data center development didn’t have to deal with constraints, including needing energy requirements like transmission lines to be available prior to coming online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without data center development, the demand increased to about 12,500 gigawatt hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet those demands, more renewable energy facilities like solar and offshore will be needed, but so will natural gas, JLARC’s report stated, which would amount to a new plant being built every one and a half years, approximately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either meeting the full unconstrained demand, or half of it, relies on offshore wind and nuclear technology, which JLARC stated could come from the “unproven” small modular reactor technology. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The percentage of costs for those upgrades that could be borne by the data center industry will be the subject of an upcoming technical conference on Dec. 16 hosted by the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, Gribbin noted.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Water use and air pollution </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the high demand for energy for data centers is the operation of the processors, but also the cooling systems, which also draw on water, depending on the technology it uses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gribbin said there are sufficient environmental protections in place for the facilities to use the same amount of water as a large office building, or about 6.7 million gallons per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fact of the matter is, it is still using a lot,” countered Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, in an interview.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37153" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/06/virginia-local-governments-will-now-have-to-plan-for-water-supply-regionally/sept-rapp-pic-morning/" rel="attachment wp-att-37153"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37153" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Rapidan River experiencing drought conditions in early September of 2023 (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added she’d like to provide more information to localities on water demands instead of hiding behind the shroud of “proprietary” information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Transparency has always been seen by the Virginia General Assembly, over the 400 years of the legislature’s existence, as an administrative burden as opposed to a requirement of government,” Roem said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report noted that data centers use fossil-fuel burning generators as back-up power sources, but “are a relatively small contributor to regional air pollution — in Northern Virginia, they make up less than 4 percent of regional emissions of nitrogen oxides and 0.1 percent or less of carbon monoxide and particulate matter emissions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, the diesel generators needed for backup power emitted only 7% of what they were allowed, which largely came from maintenance testing.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economic</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s data center exemption totaled about $928.6 million in savings in 2023, and went primarily to the big four tech companies, Amazon Web Services, Google, Meta and Microsoft, according to JLARC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state is competing with other “primary markets” for data centers that offer tax exemptions. Those markets include facilities that amount to about 1,600 megawatts in Hillsboro, Oregon, 1,560 in Phoenix, Arizona, 1,170 megawatts in Columbus, Ohio and 1,070 mw in Atlanta, Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 74,000 jobs a year stem from the industry; about1,500 are created during construction, in the form of concrete pourers and electricians. Once in operation, data centers employ about 50 people on site with roles including site managers, IT professionals and security personnel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities around the state have benefited from the business personal property and real estate taxes. But the variations of tax incentives to lure in data centers can offset how much revenue is given to jurisdictions, and economically distressed areas with less flat land and accessibility to transmission lines may have difficulty competing, Gribbin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While noting the energy costs concerns, Republican Del. Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William suggested legislative action on data centers is inevitable in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s impossible to see nothing happen,” Lovejoy said. </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After decades of work to clean up the polluted Chesapeake Bay, the federal, state and local partners within the 64,000-mile watershed have acknowledged they won’t reach their 2025 goals. But neither are they giving up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement, the regional partnership of states within the watershed, will gather Tuesday in Annapolis to discuss how to achieve not only those goals but new ones.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the discussion already has included pollution reduction measures farmers can adopt, and funding for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The good news is that we’re entering this meeting with the partnership stronger than ever,” said Adam Ortiz, the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s administrator in the mid-Atlantic, who noted this will be the first meeting since 2014 with the governors from Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of all three is an indication of the importance of the Chesapeake Bay to their states’ ecosystems — it is home to over 300 types of fish, birds, insects and plants — and economy. The Bay’s seafood industry alone is worth $3 billion a year to Virginia and Maryland, according to the </span><a href="https://www.naturalresources.virginia.gov/initiatives/chesapeake-bay/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acknowledging the shortcomings of the work so far, the Chesapeake Bay Program Beyond 2025 Steering Committee earlier this year </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/who/group/beyond-2025-steering-committee" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommitting to the partnership and streamlining processes. It also advocated for local involvement and new approaches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued a four-page Executive Directive, stressing that, “Virginia is committed to being a part of the Partnership and continuing our efforts to protect the bay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he also wrote, “it is evident that a clearer path forward is needed.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Behind on the Bay </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After starting the partnership in 1983 with a one page document, the partnership&#8217;s work has become a complex system with the states making commitments to reach certain </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakeprogress.com/outcome-status" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as oyster abundance and water quality standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has met 100% of its sediment reduction targets, but only reached 80% of the reduction for nitrogen and 62% of the reduction for phosphorus. The concern is that those nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients feed harmful algal blooms and oxygen-deprived “dead zones,” that culminate with less than desired water quality standards. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41076" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4247/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41076" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4247-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4247-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4247-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4247-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4247-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4247-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4247-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Cows in a stream in Rockingham County.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/news/pressrelease/chesapeake-bay-sees-slight-improvement-in-water-quality" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">29.8%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Bay and the tidal tributaries feeding into it were found to have met water quality standards, “below the 100% attainment necessary to support a healthy Bay ecosystem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chesapeake Bay restoration is at a crossroads,” said Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Director Chris Moore in a recent statement lauding Youngkin’s commitment to the partnership. “Virginia’s upcoming legislative session is a prime opportunity for the Commonwealth to continue our important investments in cleaner waterways and iconic living resources.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The causes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work on the bay the past 40 years have focused on pollution reductions from the stormwater and wastewater sectors, and the agricultural community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a December 2023 meeting with the Virginia State Water Commission, Mike Rolband, the director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, reported that upgrades to </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26062024/chesapeake-bay-program-flunked-2025-cleanup-goals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stormwater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treatment plants, which are behind on the goals, and </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl/wastewater-out-front-bay-restoration" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wastewater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treatment plants, which are ahead of the goals, had led to a reduction of 8.2 million pounds of nitrogen and 708 pounds of phosphorus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But farmers, while making </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD376/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, have only installed about 6,095 acres of forested buffers, or 28% of what&#8217;s needed for targets set for 2027. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41080" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:838px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41080" rel="attachment wp-att-41080"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41080" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices.jpg" alt="" width="838" height="337" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices.jpg 838w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices-300x121.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices-768x309.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A chart of agricultural practices installed in Virginia. (Courtesy of Department of Conservation and Recreation).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martha Moore, vice president of governmental relations with the Virginia Farm Bureau, said the slow adoption rates were due to insufficient funding from the state’s cost-share program</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They got really frustrated,” said Moore of farmers who were told, “we just don’t have the money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers also were upset that they were not part of the conversation. This year that changes with the creation of a farmers advisory </span><a href="https://www.bayjournal.com/ag-and-the-bay/ag-bay-storylist/ag-to-get-greater-voice-in-chesapeake-bay-cleanup-effort/article_c9a892c2-b0b4-11ef-99da-5bf2c9855093.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that we can’t see an acceleration of and completion of the restoration effort without the success of farmers,” Ortiz said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his directive, Youngkin acknowledges a need to verify best management practices that may be happening but not being counted, which happens because they haven’t been reevaluated in years. Moore said a survey with the Virginia Cooperative Extension will help capture those numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really what we want to see is the continuation and building upon where we’re seeing those successes,” said Travis Voyles, secretary of Natural and Historic Resources, in an interview. “Avoiding the hammer, but really embracing those incentive based approaches, in a voluntary manner, that are being effective.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s directive also calls for an evaluation of water quality improvement funds, which provide the funding for the stormwater and wastewater plant upgrades. Excess revenues for the fund are to be directed to the best management practice cost-share program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview Friday, Chris Pomeroy, an attorney with the Virginia Association of Municipal Wastewater Agencies, said funding for the wastewater sector must continue in order to maintain the reductions that have been made, calling it “the single most important thing Virginia can do.”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pomeroy said about $600 million had been appropriated so far and about $800 million is needed to complete projects underway.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41077" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1783px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4243/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41077" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588.jpg" alt="" width="1783" height="1122" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588.jpg 1783w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588-300x189.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588-1024x644.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588-768x483.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588-1536x967.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1783px) 100vw, 1783px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, speaks during a Joint Senate Agriculture Conservation and Natural Resources Committee and House Agriculture Chesapeake and Natural Resources Committee retreat in September. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the agricultural program fully funded now, Moore said, “I’m just very proud of the fact that we finally have achieved that goal. Now, I think we just have to figure out, how do we get to the end?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One potential way, according to the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board that oversees the conservation districts around the state that administer the cost-share program, is more staffing to get the money out the door. A point the board made in a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Letter-to-Senator-Marsden-and-Delegate-Bulova-1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, and Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, the chairs of Virginia’s natural resource and agricultural committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team is now deploying more resources than at any point in their history, while pay compression and uncompetitive salaries strain the Department’s ability to retain key staff,” wrote board chair Charles Newton. “The Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board is concerned that without new investment into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Department’s team, the agency will face more staff loss and be unable to keep pace with the growing demands for their services.”</span></p>

(Ellison Orcutt/ Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The little bumblebee, considered a keystone species because of how it benefits the environment through pollination, could be getting some buzzworthy survival assistance along the Virginia and West Virginia state border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 25, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service </span><a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2024-11/seeking-public-comment-proposed-critical-habitat-rusty-patched-bumble-bee" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">designating about 1.6 million acres of land across the country as a critical habitat for the rusty patched bumblebee. The area </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/11/26/2024-27316/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-designation-of-critical-habitat-for-the-rusty-patched" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">118,603 acres in Bath and Highland counties in Virginia, and Greenbrier and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Hatfield, a senior conservation biologist in the endangered species program at the Xerces Society, said he’s “glad the service is using this tool,” though he has some questions over the effectiveness of the designation in urban areas in mid-western parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia these are the most isolated population of the rusty patched bumblebee that we know about,” Hatfield said. “Their contribution to the resilience (of the species) I don’t think can be overstated. Those populations are critically important.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How we got here</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rusty patched bumblebee is the little black and yellow critter with a brown spot on its second abdominal segment, giving it its name, though the Queen bees are entirely yellow. The bees pollinate several plant species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bee was common throughout midwestern and northeastern parts of the U.S., and Canada, but since the 1990s it has </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/lucas-rhoads/another-court-victory-rusty-patched-bumble-bee" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 90% of its range, or area in which it is found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evidence suggests the causes of the decline to be sickness and exposure to some pesticides, as well as habitat loss, small population changes and the effects of climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the agency added the bee to the Endangered Species Act, which requires federal agencies to determine if any permitted activity would adversely impact the species. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bee disrupted the building of the since-</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/09/08/virginias-vanishing-bee-state-works-to-save-rusty-patched-bumblebee/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">canceled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Judges in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals yanked the permits for the project after determining the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had erred in saying it wouldn’t have a detrimental impact on the species’ survival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the Natural Resources Defense said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had erred again by failing to designate a critical habitat for the bee and saying such wouldn’t benefit the species. After settlements, the federal agency agreed to make a critical habitat designation by Nov. 20 of this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This decision represents a vital step forward for one of America’s most endangered pollinators,” said Lucas Rhoads, senior attorney for pollinators and pesticides at the Natural Resources Defense Council</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot afford further delays in protecting high-quality habitat that can save the bee from extinction. We look forward to this proposal being finalized as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Virginia lands</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the proposal, the bee’s protected habitat in West Virginia and Virginia consists of 11,200 acres of  private lands, 1,845 acres of Virginia-owned lands, and 105,558 acres of federal lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federally conserved lands include the Monongahela and George Washington and Jefferson National Forests. The entire 1.6 million acres overlap with habitats for other already-endangered species, USFWS said, meaning “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">little additional conservation effort is usually needed beyond what is already in place.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellison Orcutt, the lead field zoologist for the Virginia Natural Heritage Program at the Department of Conservation and Recreation, said the proposed area in north Bath County is a known High Potential Zone, or HPZ. There, the cooler climate and lack of development from the  federally protected forested land will likely make a favorable habitat for the bees, Orcutt said. </span></p>

(Courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DCR’s Natural Heritage Program has been working to conserve the species after its first identification in the state since the 1990s came in 2014, along with several other insects and plants, Orcutt explained. That work includes the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources creating a Wildlife Management Area in neighboring Highland County, which now hosts native wildflowers the bees favor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal notes that the Appalachian region is home to a genetically diverse variation of the bee.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, without baseline genetic data, “it&#8217;s unclear if this distinct genetic group existed before (the bee’s) decline or if it&#8217;s emerged since 1990 or so after the decline,” said Lori Ann Burd, environmental health director with the Center for Biological Diversity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The diversity could be the result of gradual shifts in genetics from the east to the west, and the nearby bees in Indiana and Ohio are now gone, making the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia bees “more easily distinct,” Burd said. At the same time, the Virginia region could also be isolated from stressors, including competition with honey bees, allowing the rusty patched bumblebees to persist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This distinct genetic population is very critical to the future of the species,” Burd also said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “A lack of genetic diversity in the species likely made the species as a whole more susceptible to disease and other stressors. The remaining populations have persisted through the major decline in the species so they may be better able to survive into the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining and spreading that critical diversity is why Hatfield said it&#8217;s important to expand protections to additional areas outside of those that have 50 or more known bee sightings. That would create corridors for the bees to migrate in and protect bees that may live in areas but aren’t documented.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If we want the species to be able to repopulate its former range outside of areas protected as critical habitat, there needs to be corridors connecting currently unpopulated healthy habitat across the entire range,&#8221; Hatfield said.</p>

(Courtesy of Virginia Department of Transportation).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Transportation estimates that it will take about three to six months to collect debris from Hurricane Helene, the storm that took the lives of three Virginians and damaged swaths of Appalachia in the southwest region of the state, leaving behind over $4 billion in damages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debris removal timeline is expected to be presented to the Virginia Commonwealth Transportation Board at its </span><a href="https://ctb.virginia.gov/media/ctb/agendas-and-meeting-minutes/2024/dec/CTB_Workshop_Meeting_Dec_2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a methodical, route-by-route process to pick up debris, make areas safe from leaning trees/limbs, and remove mud/rock/soil resulting from slides,” said Jessica Cowardin, spokesperson for VDOT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helene made landfall in Florida on Sept. 26 before it hit Southwest Virginia Sept. 27, causing the New River to rise to 31 feet in some areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of thousands lost power, and businesses large and small suffered damage, prompting Gov. Glenn Youngkin to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/18/virginia-localities-affected-by-hurricane-helene-now-eligible-for-special-snap-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">submit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the White House and Congress last month a total estimate of $4.4 billion in damages in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez, press secretary for Youngkin, said the state is collaborating with federal, state, and local partners to advocate for “Virginia to receive targeted, accelerated federal support from agencies … to expedite recovery and provide the necessary assistance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOT is expecting to receive all federal reimbursement for their efforts over a period of three years, including Federal Emergency Management public assistance and Federal Highway Administration emergency relief assistance for up to 100% of the costs to respond to the storm and rebuild roadways. Some of that funding, as well as individual assistance funding, has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/14/youngkin-urges-hurricane-helene-survivors-to-contact-officials-shares-storm-recovery-update/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">begun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be dispersed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storm caused an estimated 511,000 cubic yards of debris to be strewn over the region.  VDOT has picked up about 110,000 cubic yards and contractors cleaned up 6,000 cubic yards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The estimate was developed based on historical information from previous storms,” Cowardin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state has a Debris Task Force, which includes FEMA, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management and several other federal and state agencies. Debris cleanup also consists of removing an estimated 135 acres of debris on the surface of </span><a href="https://www.nao.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/3948201/debris-removal-effort-ramps-up-at-claytor-lake-with-additional-resources/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claytor Lake.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The effort includes survey vessels, modular pontoon barges, hydraulic excavators and a 300-ton crane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in October, FEMA </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241016/federal-agencies-working-together-multimillion-dollar-mission-remove-debris" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a “multi-million” commitment with the Army Corps and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for debris removal from both Claytor Lake and the South Holston Lake Area over the span of about four months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Debris removal on the water is inherently more complex,” said Col. Sonny Avichal, commander of USACE’s Norfolk District, in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOT will also share on Wednesday an estimated timeline of about 12 months to rebuild damaged roads and structures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of roadways and structures including bridges that needed repair peaked after the storm peaked at 414 and 99 in the immediate aftermath of Helene, respectively. Since then, seven roadways and and four structures remain to be repaired. Damaged roadways include Routes 58 and 1212 in Damascus, and the Route 725 bridge in Taylor’s Valley was also impaired.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunity for residents who want solar on their property is expanding to the Richmond and Hampton Roads area amid potential changes to how much savings Virginia&#8217;s two largest utilities will offer to customers who install panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar United Neighbors says participation in its co-op program to install solar panels on residential properties can be a way to hedge against larger electricity bills coming from that increase, and while using carbon-free energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I haven&#8217;t paid Dominion Energy for (energy) consumption in almost 18 months,” said Brandon Praileau, Virginia program director for the group, who said he installed solar panels on a church he’s a pastor at earlier this decade. “The utility rate has risen … since I went solar, but I don&#8217;t see it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-op model SUN advocates for involves a period when community members join as a group to ask a solar developer to install panels on their properties. The larger ask brings the cost of installation down compared to companies needing to complete one-off projects, Praileau explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once 20 to 30 members sign up, the co-op will send out a request for proposals to developers, which will then be reviewed by a selection committee of a few members to determine which builder to go with. The installer pays SUN a referral fee for each member who signs up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The spring, summer and the early bit of September, October — that&#8217;s peak season time,” Praileau said. “The goal is to try to get those systems installed so that those consumers will be able to produce peak energy consumption during the peak time of solar.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the ultimate savings equation includes selling renewable energy credits created when solar energy is produced, and participating in net metering, Praileau added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net-metering reduces the need to pull electricity from the grids’ centralized generation sources, and allows the excess energy that is produced to be sold back to the utility, with the value of that sale being credited, or netted, against a customer’s future bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think of it like the old AT&amp;T rollover minutes. The minutes you don&#8217;t use roll over to the next month. It&#8217;s the same concept here,” Praileau said. “If you produce more energy than what you consume, that unused energy you bank is then rolled over to the next month for you to then draw back from against whatever your next month&#8217;s energy consumption is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Renewable Energy Labs, the average residential solar install is about 7.5 kilowatts. The equation saving’s answer in Virginia, Praileau said, ultimately amounts to customers getting a return on their 30-year investment on a 4 to 8 kilowatt system in about eight or nine years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What makes that eight years reasonable are the incentive tax credits around solar right now on the federal level … and if you&#8217;re in a rural area,” Praileau said, adding some localities have tax credits, too. “There might be credits for you if you&#8217;re in a disadvantaged community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the savings do come with “cost-shifting” concerns. For instance, non-solar users argue that solar users benefit from the grid for energy needs when their panels aren’t producing or when they&#8217;re selling their excess energy back to the grid. That concern has prompted Appalachian Power Company, which serves Southwest Virginia, to ask regulators to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/13/appalachian-power-company-requests-reduction-to-pay-rate-for-net-metering-solar-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its payment for excess power from 16 cents per kilowatt hour to 4 cents per kilowatt hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian’s request, Praileau said, “basically would kill the solar market and kill the solar industry, because that makes the return on investment like 30 years,” and puts an increased focus on what Dominion Energy may request with the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also already a cost shift happening across the entire grid, Praileau said, with new generation sources needing to be added to the grid to meet rising energy demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who do you think is going to pay for that? The rate payer is going to pay for that,” Praileau said. “Where is the real cost shift to?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUN began a </span><a href="https://solarunitedneighbors.org/co-ops/virginia/richmond-and-hampton-roads-fall-2024-co-op/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Richmond and Hampton Roads area Nov. 21 and will run it until April 4. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest campaign comes after four previous ones in Virginia, which includes Arlington and Fairfax counties, D.C. and the Maryland counties of Howard, Montgomery and Frederick. As a result of those about 1,000 customers signed up and about 4.8 megawatts of solar has been installed leading to an investment of about $4 million, Praileau said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that Virginia&#8217;s energy consumption is rising at a very rapid pace,” said Praileau, adding that getting more residential solar, or “distributed generation” on the grid is part of alleviating the demand. Pair that with battery storage and demand side management programs with smart meters that can adjust a home&#8217;s electricity needs to create “virtual power plants,” Praileau said, “you can add just as much capacity as you could building a peaker power plant,” which Dominion is doing to ensure grid </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/22/air-regulators-awaiting-info-for-dominions-proposed-natural-gas-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reliability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those tools Praileau laid out are available as the state and municipalities have pledged to reduce fossil fuel emissions in their jurisdictions. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments set a target to have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/27/d-c-region-including-nova-sets-ambitious-goal-for-rooftop-solar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">250,000 rooftops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> install solar. The City of Richmond has reduced the 3.5 million tons of community-wide carbon emissions in 2022 by 23% as part of its goal to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The plan includes the adoption of residential </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/FullDocumentRVAgreenClimateEquityActionPlan2030.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Three percent of the city-wide emissions are from municipal government,” said Laura Thomas,  director of the Office of Sustainability with the city of Richmond during a recent media even. “That means 97% (of reductions) need to happen out in the community.”</span></p>

Thanks to India reducing its tariff on frozen turkey, Virginia turkey farmers have a new market. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginians gather around the table for some Thanksgiving turkey, the state&#8217;s first shipment of turkey products are headed to India, thanks in part to the work of the state&#8217;s two U.S. senators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Sen. Mark Warner announced that India will receive the frozen birds after reduced tariffs facilitated the first shipment</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Obviously you&#8217;ve got a big turkey industry in the Shenandoah Valley,” Warner said during a press conference on Nov. 14. “We have been fighting for some time to get the markets of India and Turkey, (the) country Turkey, open. That has now taken place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Virginia was the country’s sixth largest producer of turkeys in 2023 with 15.5 million birds, while its North Carolina neighbor ranked second with 29 million birds. Minnesota had the most with 38.5 million birds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Virginia’s turkey production contributed to the overall poultry industry’s economic impact of $5.8 billion directly to Virginia’s economy. John King, president of the Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative, said in a statement that the shipment to India “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will directly benefit our nearly 200 independent grower owners.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shipment earlier this month occurred after Ambassador Katherine Tai, the U.S. trade representative, worked with India to get the country to reduce tariffs on frozen turkey, frozen duck and fresh frozen, dried and processed blueberries and cranberries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June 2023, before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the United States, Warner, Sen. Tim Kaine and five other senators sent a </span><a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7/6/7638bcc5-a2eb-4c3f-93a9-462c8d258d29/905D5CD94F560DB2CD32591ADD0D8148.6.21.23-india-u.s.-turkey-letter-to-ustr-final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Tai urging her to work to get India to reduce the tariff, which amounted to an additional 30% duty, or fee. In </span><a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2023/september/united-states-announces-resolution-outstanding-wto-poultry-dispute-india" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Tai announced the tariff for turkey products dropping to 5%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Resolving this last outstanding (World Trade Organization) dispute represents an important milestone in the U.S.-India trade relationship, while reducing tariffs on certain U.S. products enhances crucial market access for American agricultural producers,” Tai said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The demand for turkey is “strong” in India, said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shana Oshinskie, a spokesperson for Warner’s office, “driven in part by their robust population growth, lack of a domestic alternative, and increasing protein need.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the World Health Organization, the population of </span><a href="https://data.who.int/countries/356" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">India</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expected to increase to about 1.7 billion people by 2050. In 2016, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, produced a </span><a href="https://kiran.nic.in/pdf/farmers_corner/pamphlets-2016/TurkeyFarming.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlining ways to increase domestic turkey rearing and called the birds’ meat “the leanest among other poultry species with lower fat and cholesterol content compared to red meat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is part of Sen. Warner’s broader push to strengthen our economic and diplomatic ties with India, one of our most key partners, and this move particularly benefits Virginia’s sizable population of poultry producers,” Oshinskie added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">King, by phone interview, said his group had sales of turkey’s at a rate of about 17.7 pounds per person when the group started 20 years ago, but that’s <a href="https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/wasde1024.pdf" target="_blank">dropped</a> to about 13.9 pounds per person this year due to bird illnesses, limited supply and rising costs. While Mexico “continues to be a great trading partner,” markets in China have become “not as reliable,” King said, prompting the desire to seek the populous India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need some help in the export markets,” King said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first shipment of frozen turkey products raised by the Virginia Poultry Growers Cooperative left the U.S. out of the Port of Virginia. They’re expected to arrive in the country in the coming weeks, Oshinskie said.</span></p>

(Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural electric cooperatives are joining in on the deployment of electric vehicle charging stations statewide, after Virginia Energy announced $1.1 million in awards to two co-ops last week, as well as an EV charger developer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&amp;N Electric Cooperative, which serves the Eastern Shore, will receive $274,290 for two charging stations in New Church and Capeville. Rappahannock Electric Cooperative, through its subsidiary Vividly Brighter, will get $121,974.40 for three chargers, including two in Caret and one in Doswell. Electric vehicle charging station developer Blink Charging will net $542,444 for five stations in Cape Charles, Norfolk, Suffolk and Petersburg and two stations to be built in Salem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds stem from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Electric Vehicle Charging Assistance Program and are being administered by the Virginia Department of Energy. A lack of available charging stations has been a challenge for EV infrastructure development across the state, a concern from major auto manufacturers amid declining sales projections, and a chief argument of opponents of policies aimed at spurring electric vehicle sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charging stations will complement the network of charging stations the federal government is also funding through the BIL and the Virginia Department of Transportation, being deployed along interstates and state highways. Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, has introduced measures to expand EV charging stations in rural areas to benefit the tourism industry, but they have failed to pass the past three years’ legislative sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation emissions constitute about one-third of the state’s and the country&#8217;s climate changing greenhouse gas releases, which  are trapping heat in the atmosphere and leading to more intense and frequent storms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement about the latest awardings, Virginia Energy said the chargers will attract more visitors to tourist destinations and support local businesses. The tourism industry in the state brought in $24 billion in 2023, the most ever, according to the statement, which added that more electric vehicle infrastructure in these rural areas “will only increase those dollars.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“EV charging stations have the potential to boost revenue of nearby businesses by $1,500 annually, keeping Virginia competitive in the evolving tourism industry,” said Glenn Davis, Virginia Energy director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology released in </span><a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/study-ev-charging-stations-boost-nearby-business-spending-0904" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that opening charging stations boosted annual spending at nearby businesses by an average of about $1,500 in 2019, and about $400 between January 2021 and June 2023. The decline was due to more EV charges being available, leading to less utilization, and a decrease in spending at businesses after the pandemic and a lower number of businesses served by each charger.</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story was corrected to say transportation emissions constitute about one-third of the state&#8217;s and country&#8217;s greenhouse gas releases.</em></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/10/governor-amends-vetoes-and-signs-energy-environment-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the legislature passed this year, Virginia’s water regulators are beginning a process to identify sources of chemicals known as PFAS or “forever chemicals,” which were found above regulatory limits in drinking water in 28 water systems across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewMeeting.cfm?MeetingID=40753" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">systems </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">include eight from Fauquier and Loudoun Counties, with a smattering of results from the rest of the state, including Fairfax County, the Hampton Roads region and Roanoke County in Southwest Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combined, the systems serve about 2.29 million people, with the Loudoun and Faquier counties systems serving about 360,000. Six systems, consisting of the Loudoun Water Central System, and one in Newport News, Norfolk, Stafford County and Fairfax County, serve about 2.2 million people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of this data has been publicly available for some time so there weren’t any big surprises,” said Carroll Courtenay, a staff attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “I’m glad to see that some water systems took advantage of self-reporting data to DEQ to make sure the PFAS assessment process is as comprehensive as possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PFAS chemicals are found in several household items, including clothing and cookware. They’re used in  firefighting foam because of their tight chemical bond that repels liquid and quells heat. That bond also makes them incredibly difficult to break down once they’re in the environment.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Identification</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality became aware of the drinking water results following a transfer of reporting data from the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/21/virginia-dept-of-health-plans-to-test-small-disadvantaged-communities-for-pfas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as required by legislation from Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, and Sen. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40946" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:948px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/pfas-systems-2/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40946" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-systems-2.jpg" alt="" width="948" height="682" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-systems-2.jpg 948w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-systems-2-300x216.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-systems-2-768x553.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 948px) 100vw, 948px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The water systems the Department of Environmental Quality will be conducting assessments on to identify sources of PFAS. (Data courtesy of DEQ)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transfer included results from past testing by VDH and results from a test called the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule, or UCMR 5, and self reporting from Loudoun and Fauquier counties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those results found the level of PFAS to be above the maximum contaminant levels to prevent death and reduce exposure for certain types of PFAS, which is 4 or 10 parts per trillion. One part per trillion is the equivalent of </span><a href="https://www.ehs.harvard.edu/news/cambridge-drinking-water" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 drop of water in 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voluntary reporting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings from Fauquier County and Loudun were self-reported, which DEQ spokesperson Irina Calos said, “is the result of their proactive approach to sampling and voluntarily sharing the data.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Shoemaker, executive Director at Fauquier County Water and Sanitation Authority, said they conducted sampling at their 48 groundwater wells supplying their system to correct a lab issue with contamination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The testing method for PFAS is similar to other water sampling methods, but since the chemicals are pervasive, it’s easy for them to transfer from clothing and infiltrate samples, creating false positives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You always have to be careful sampling drinking water, for PFAS you have to be even more careful,” said Shoemaker. “There’s a whole set of guidelines out there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sampling was also done to meet requirements for funding from class action lawsuits to deal with PFAS, Shoemaker said.  It cost about $500 per test, meaning it cost about $25,000 to test all their wells.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let&#8217;s just go sample everything we have,” Shoemaker said of his agency’s reasoning. “That way we&#8217;re not guessing, there&#8217;s no questions. We can find out what we got and we can deal with it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a similar sense, Loudoun Water, the provider for the Loudoun Water Central System, Beacon Hill-LCSA and Creighton Farms systems, has worked to understand their situation and provide information on their website for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We value coordination with our regional water community to improve our collective understanding of PFAS occurrence, identify sources and how to mitigate it,” said Sue Crosby, executive director of communications for Loudoun Water.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Assessment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the results have been revealed, the law from McPike and Rasoul now requires DEQ to evaluate “potential sources” and notify them to either self-report, self-report and monitor, or just monitor, Calos said, which could be done by relying on past information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sources of PFAS are typically thought to be manufacturing facilities that discharge them in their wastewater and landfills, from which the chemicals can leak without protections like liners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ could use a past voluntary survey they sent out in 2022 to identify PFAS sources, Calos acknowledged, but the 10% response rate, “was low, and the information…is dated.” Another potential source is the Danville Northside Wastewater Treatment plant, which the SELC and environmental advisory group Wild Virginia said is </span><a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/press-release/groups-urge-deq-to-stop-pfas-pollution-at-its-source-in-issuing-permit-to-danville-va-treatment-plant/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">known </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to discharge PFAS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If in surface water, the sources could be anywhere upstream in the watershed, including discharges permitted by DEQ under the VPDES program and/or places where DEQ allows land application for sludge,” said David Sligh, conservation director of Wild Virginia. “If in groundwater, as is the case for the majority in this list, the source could be anything that happens on the land.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39020" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1901px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/21/virginia-dept-of-health-plans-to-test-small-disadvantaged-communities-for-pfas/pfas-6-13-24-with-legend/" rel="attachment wp-att-39020"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39020" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend.jpg" alt="" width="1901" height="756" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend.jpg 1901w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-300x119.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-1024x407.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-768x305.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-1536x611.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1901px) 100vw, 1901px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A screenshot of sites sampled for PFAS by the Virginia Department of Health (Courtesy of Virginia Department of Health)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difficulty for groundwater wells, Shoemaker said, is that the source could be biosolids spread on agricultural land as fertilizers or other activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, an explosive car crash could have occurred on a property a decade ago and firefighting foam could’ve been used to squelch the fire. PFAS could leak  into one well but not another on the same property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The short answer (is) we don&#8217;t know,”  Shoemaker said about where the PFAS came from in Fauquier County water. He was surprised the initial results showed exceedances of the chemicals, since the area doesn&#8217;t have much industrial activity and is pretty rural.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ubiquitous nature of PFAS chemicals is one reason lawmakers crafted the law to require DEQ to identify potential sources, and then prioritize requirements for reporting and monitoring. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">PFAS advisory committee</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PFAS Advisory Committee, created by the law and seen as a way to provide oversight of DEQ’s actions to address PFAS, is now determining the prioritization process for identifying sources. But environmental groups are concerned about their lack of participation so far in that process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee is evaluating how other states like Arizona, North Carolina and Maryland have made assessments, and the “public health impacts, drinking water system characteristics, and environmental considerations,” for potential sources, Calos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Surface waters are looking at the entire watershed upstream of the water treatment plant,” Calos said. “For groundwater (GW) sources we are looking at a three (mile) radius from the well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prioritization process is expected to be put into a draft plan and shared with the Committee at a Dec. 16 meeting and finalized in January. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40948" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1430px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40948" rel="attachment wp-att-40948"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40948" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-committee-members.jpg" alt="" width="1430" height="768" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-committee-members.jpg 1430w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-committee-members-300x161.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-committee-members-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PFAS-committee-members-768x412.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1430px) 100vw, 1430px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The members of the PFAS Advisory Committee. (Screenshot courtesy of minutes from the meeting)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But absent from the committee is an environmental group, as required by law. DEQ Director Mike Rolband is in charge of making appointments, according to the measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is absolutely unacceptable that DEQ has failed to include conservation group representatives on the committee well before the first meeting was held on November 8th,” said Sligh, who added that he notified DEQ of his qualifications, which include being a former employee for the State Water Control Board and DEQ who oversaw pollution permits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By that failure, Director Rolband is violating the express command of the statute and I hope legislators will insist that he correct it immediately,” Sligh said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the claim, Calos said DEQ consulted with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, James River Association and SELC, which led them to offer the position to a Duke University professor whom the groups recommended, but she declined the invitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ has reached back out to these environmental groups to obtain additional recommendations that will be considered,” Calos said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ will evaluate the credentials of those individuals recommended and appoint additional members to the committee as needed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency has hired two of three additional staff to carry out the legislation’s goals, and will continue its rotating fish tissue sampling to support the identification process, which has already happened in the basins of Tennessee/Big Sandy, Chowan, James, Potomac/Shenandoah, Rappahannock, and Roanoke Rivers. The New River basin, the York River basin, and the small coastal basin remain to be sampled.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s air regulators are awaiting data from Dominion Energy to further process the utility&#8217;s air permit request for the natural gas plant they’re proposing to build to meet rising energy needs, as pushback over the location and potential environmental impact of the facility continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are expecting to receive air quality monitoring data … in the next couple of weeks or so,” said Mike Dowd, director of air and renewable energy at the Department of Environmental Quality, in an update to the State Air Pollution Control Board Thursday. “As soon as we get the air quality modeling data, we will be processing the permit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton confirmed to The Mercury that the utility is “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently planning to submit our modeling report to DEQ in early 2025.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy, Virginia’s largest utility, is proposing the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to meet increased energy demands expected to hit the state as a result of data center development. After local opposition, Dominion moved the proposed location from an industrial site on Battery Brooke Parkway to its former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station on Coxendale Road. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction is expected to start in 2026. It’s expected to be operational in 2029.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental and community groups have staunchly fought against the project, saying it runs counter to the state’s 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act that mandates the retirement of fossil fuels by 2045, unless there’s a concern over being able to reliably send electricity to the grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics also are concerned about the air pollution impacting the surrounding community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The update on the timeline means next year </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“is going to be pretty busy in terms of the public engagement,” said Mason Manley, a field manger with Clean Virginia, an advocacy group formed by millionaire Michael Bills to oppose Dominion’s influence in the legislature. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The public will likely have the chance to weigh in on both the air permit for the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, as well as a separate Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, Manley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The air permit is expected to be issued by July 28, according to DEQ’s permitting website, with public engagement opportunities occurring before then. The CPCN is going to be requested “in the first quarter of 2025,” said Slayton, with Dominion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andy Farmer, a spokesperson for the SCC, said “It is too early to discuss an SCC public engagement process when an application hasn’t been filed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After Dominion files the application, the SCC will issue an Order for Notice and Hearing that will include a hearing schedule and public comment opportunities,” Farmer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manley said the public engagement opportunity is when community members can make their case for a denial or express their concerns necessitating controls for emissions be put in place. Last month, community members held a “People’s Hearing” to collect public testimony that will be submitted to DEQ during the public engagement period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The air permit) is extremely important, (Dominion) can&#8217;t actually begin construction until that is issued,” Manley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timeline update comes as opposition continues over local approval of the land use for the project, which is considered one of the first requirements before the DEQ and SCC processes can finish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the Friends of the Chesterfield, a group formed to oppose the plant, filed another appeal with the Chesterfield County Board of Zoning Appeals over a decision to use a 2010 conditional use permit for the Coxendale Road site for the proposed plant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, the friends group challenged a zoning determination from Chesterfield County Deputy Administrator Jesse Smith, but the zoning board said that determination was made as part of the air permitting process under the air board’s authority, not its own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the rejection, the friends group followed up with Chesterfield County Chesterfield County Planning Director Andrew Gillies with their own request for a zoning determination on using the conditional use permit for the new site. Gillies responded on Oct. 18 saying that the previous letter stating the existing conditional use permit applies to the proposed plant, “fully answers your letter.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evan Johns, an attorney with Appalachian Mountain Advocates, which filed both appeals on behalf of the Friends group, said the second appeal is a response to a determination by Gillies, a zoning official, which the groups says is reviewable by the zoning board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like a determination that can be reviewed,” said Johns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County spokesperson Teresa Bonifas said, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not comment on pending or potential litigation.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next zoning board meeting is scheduled for Dec. 4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another requirement for the air permit process is a determination of “site suitability.” As Chesterfield County has declined to make that determination, Dowd said “there hasn’t been a full resolution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I assume this is all part and parcel with (the appeal),” Dowd said.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters outside the Capitol near the end of the 2024 General Assembly session. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floyd County Circuit Court Judge Randall Lowe ruled Wednesday Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin acted unlawfully by withdrawing Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a program aimed to reduce climate changing emissions that has funneled hundreds of millions to the state to deal with the impacts of extreme weather events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his five page opinion, Lowe wrote that “the only body with the authority to repeal the RGGI regulation would be the General Assembly. This is because a statute, the RGGI Act, requires the RGGI regulation to exist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the reasons set out in this opinion, the court finds that the attempted repeal of the RGGI Regulation is unlawful, and thereby null and void,” Lowe wrote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">RGGI background and how we got here</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia began participating in RGGI in 2021 after Democrats, with trifecta control of state government the year prior, passed the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act (which Lowe referred to as the RGGI Act).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RGGI is a multi-state program in which electricity producers in participating states are required to buy allowances for the emissions they produce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proceeds from the allowances are returned to the states, where, in Virginia, about $830 million had been generated for programs increasing flood resiliency and energy efficiency efforts prior to the state’s withdrawal at the end of last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the 2020 law, 50% of the funds go toward energy efficiency programs that reduce how much electricity is needed, 45% go toward the Community Flood Preparedness Fund, or the flood fund for community-scale flood protection projects, with 5% used for administrative functions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, utilities produce their own electricity and are allowed to recover the costs of the allowances from ratepayers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a typical Dominion customer, the recovery amounted to a $2.39 monthly fee, before it was paused amid uncertainty around Virginia&#8217;s participation in RGGI. The fee was then added back in the amount of $4.34 for a typical residential customer to make up for when cost recovery wasn’t levied and participation in RGGI continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fee is no longer tacked on to utility bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That fee is what Youngkin called a “hidden tax,” when he proposed a regulation in the fall of 2022 to repeal the existing regulation requiring Virginia’s participation in RGGI. The State Air Pollution Control Board approved the repeal regulation in August 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day of that vote, four groups filed a challenge against the Youngkin administration in Fairfax County Circuit Court. The judge found only one group, the Association of Energy Conservation Professionals, had standing to bring allegations forward and transferred the matter to Floyd County Circuit Court, the jurisdiction where AECP is headquartered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There, the Floyd County Circuit judge recused himself over a conflict of interest and the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares, representing the Youngkin administration, argued for the case to be reheard in front of the Lowe, who issued his ruling Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the ruling means</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowe based his decision that Youngkin overreached on precedents set by two cases, Supervisors of Botetourt County v. Cahoon from 1917, and Bean vs. Simmons from 1852.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Cahoon case, the court ruled that where this a “duty coupled with the power …usually the power must be exercised,” Lowe noted, adding that “what they are empowered to do … the law requires shall be done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bean case, Lowe explained, demonstrated that where “public interest and right are concerned,” the public has a right to agency powers being used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RGGI Act, Lowe wrote, includes in the first substantive provision that participation in RGGI “shall be incorporated” by DEQ without further action by the air board. The RGGI Act also “hereby authorized” the DEQ Director to participate in RGGI, Lowe pointed out, thereby coupling the duty to participate in RGGI and the power to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There can be no doubt that the RGGI Act is designed for the purposes discussed in Cahoon,” Lowe wrote. “Because (the AG’s office) lacked the statutory authority to repeal the RGGI Regulation, it is unnecessary to address whether the decision to do so was supported by substantial evidence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had the Youngkin administration “amended,” the RGGI regulation in ways that were still consistent with the law, Lowe added, “it is doubtful that their authority to do so could be challenged. That is not what happened here.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reaction from environmental advocates and lawmakers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups and Democratic lawmakers had said repeatedly that the RGGI withdrawal was unlawful and hurt Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Billy Weitzenfeld, former executive director of the Association of Energy Conservation Professionals, said in a statement, “All along we knew that the actions taken by the Air Board and DEQ were wrong.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His group was granted standing in the case by Lowe because the repeal of the regulation meant the association was injured by losing a source of revenue to carry out their energy efficiency work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a win for communities across Virginia who have benefited from the state’s participation in RGGI in the past and those that now will have a chance to continue to see those benefits,” Weitzenfeld said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chelsea Harnish, executive director of the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council, noted that the revenue from RGGI “cannot be replaced or matched,” since the allowance revenues “exceeded every other source of energy efficiency funding in Virginia combined.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of other environmental groups hailed the judge’s decision as a victory. Mike Town, Executive Director of the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, said the result of Youngkin’s move was, “dirtier air, more communities left exposed to floodwaters, and fewer tools to help Virginians cut energy costs.” Walton Shepherd, Virginia director and senior attorney with the group, added that “as we witness the grim toll of the increasingly dangerous weather in a warming world, today’s decision is good news for all Virginians.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, who carried the 2020 law through its passing and pushed for a budget amendment this past session to reinstate Virginia in RGGI, said the decision was a “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">resounding victory for Virginia’s families.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are proud to stand with every Virginian who benefits from this initiative and will continue fighting to ensure these protections remain intact,” said Herring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in response to Lowe’s determination, Youngkin Press Secretary Christian Martinez, said, “We respectfully disagree with the judge&#8217;s decision and will pursue an appeal.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin remains committed to lowering the cost of living for Virginians by continuing to oppose the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which fails to effectively incentivize emission reductions in the Commonwealth,” Martinez said. “Instead, it functions as a regressive tax, hidden in utility, bills passed on to all Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, in response to a question about the judge’s decision posed by  </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/author/cameron-thompson" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cameron Thompson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Richmond television station WTVR on Wednesday, said, “I think you can see from the beginning this is in the governor’s powers and how the law was actually written to the Virginia code. … We obviously have a disagreement in the interpretation of the law and the code.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Next steps</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowes’ opinion explains the rationale behind his decision and will need to be followed up by an order to officially repeal the regulation that withdrew Virginia from RGGI, and reinstate the previous regulation requiring participation, explained Nate Benforado, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represented the AECP. The timing of that order is yet to be determined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the old regulation goes back into effect, DEQ will then need to take the steps necessary to resume participation in RGGI, Benforado said. While the Youngkin administration has stated they’ll be appealing the decision, they’ll need to also ask for a stay, or a pause, if they want to delay resuming participation in RGGI while they challenge Lowe’s decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling the ruling “validating,” Benforado said, “It is up to the administration on what they want to do next.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RGGI program, Benforado added, was “critical” to reducing one-third of emission from independent power producers, since the state’s other landmark law reducing emission from power companies, the Virginia Clean Economy Act, applies only to Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“RGGI is really the key, if not the only tool, Virginia has,” Benforado said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s third major emissions-reducing regulation, which tethered Virginia’s vehicle tailpipe emissions to California’s Advanced Clean Car II standards that ban the sale of new gas powered vehicles starting in 2035, has also been repealed during Youngkin’s tenure. Environmental groups have signaled they’ll challenge that administrative move, also.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for Miyares’ office declined to elaborate on questions from the Virginia Mercury concerning what happens next with the state’s RGGI participation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We look forward to defending the commonsense repeal of this counterproductive program on appeal,&#8221; the spokesperson said.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Sen. Marsden to host summit on Virginia Clean Economy Act next week&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/sen-marsden-to-host-summit-on-virginia-clean-economy-act-next-week/embed/#?secret=BRpvvKKik6#?secret=nBWrjz5cOB" data-secret="nBWrjz5cOB" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s spiking appetite for electricity is fueled by the continued development of data centers here, which funnel about 70% of the world&#8217;s internet traffic, said Kate Smiley, </span>director of Virginia government affairs for the Data Center Coalition. There are about 11,000 data centers in the world, with about 500 in Virginia, or 4.5%, she said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That explosion of electricity needs, and the  realities of how enacting the VCEA have played out, were the center of dialogue at the summit, convened by Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is serious business,” Marsden said. “It’s going to be the most serious business that this Commonwealth deals with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are seven key takeaways from the meeting.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Solar siting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process of solar project approval in Virginia is expected to  lead to clashes this legislative session. Legislators are considering proposals that could give state officials authority to approve projects if localities reject proposals. Other ideas include creating a regional siting board to review projects or have state officials issue an advisory opinion to localities to lend technical expertise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 75 localities have approved solar projects, according to Aaron Berryhill, solar program manager at Virginia Energy. But one solar company said during a panel the uncertainty of the local approval process is causing “sleepless nights.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Local permitting is more consequential and influential to the success of our business than any other factor in development,” said Danny Van Clief, CEO of Sun Tribe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean Lynch, executive director of the Virginia Association of Counties, a member of the panel, said the group is interested in continuing conversations on the proposals, but “we want authority,” not just input on decisions.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">SMRs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">67 years after the U.S. Army’s first nuclear reactor was deployed at Ft. Belvoir in 1957, Dominion Energy is pursuing the construction of a small nuclear reactor (SMR), said </span>Todd Flowers, manager of business development at the utility.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressional action, called the </span><a href="https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/governing-laws/advance-act.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ADVANCE Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has streamlined the licensing and permitting process to mitigate the “threats to deploy nuclear,” Flowers said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As tech companies build out artificial intelligence amid the development of data centers, providing adequate American power is key to “strengthening our national security,” said David Long, vice president of operations at HII Nuclear Mission Technologies.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ddXsoKGv4M"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/amazon-announces-deal-with-dominion-energy-to-develop-a-small-nuclear-reactor/">Amazon announces deal with Dominion Energy to develop a small nuclear reactor</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Amazon announces deal with Dominion Energy to develop a small nuclear reactor&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/amazon-announces-deal-with-dominion-energy-to-develop-a-small-nuclear-reactor/embed/#?secret=5wBDPjJ2o6#?secret=ddXsoKGv4M" data-secret="ddXsoKGv4M" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMRs can help the U.S. win against other nations in the “AI race,” Long said. “Nuclear has got to be part of that.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">PJM queue </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is part of a regional grid transmission operator, called PJM Interconnection, which also has authority to approve solar projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to an influx of solar project proposals, PJM has a backlog of about 208,500 megawatts of energy generation sources awaiting approval across its entire footprint, which stretches across the mid-Atlantic. About 53,492 megawatts is awaiting approval in Virginia, with about 29,600 of that being solar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM Interconnection is undergoing reforms and expects to get about 107 projects on the ground in Virginia by the end of 2025, totalling about 11,967 megawatts.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40890" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2236px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40890" rel="attachment wp-att-40890"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40890 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293.jpg" alt="" width="2236" height="1080" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293.jpg 2236w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293-300x145.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293-1024x495.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293-768x371.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293-1536x742.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot_20241118_210740_Adobe-Acrobat-e1731982804293-2048x989.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2236px) 100vw, 2236px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The energy generation projects from Virginia that are stuck in PJM Interconnection&#8217;s approval queue, part of a presentation at the VCEA summit held Nov. 18, 2024. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It really depends” if developers can overcome local land use permitting and financing obstacles to get those projects online to help with incremental increase in energy needs, Matthew LaRocque, senior consultant at PJM Interconnection, told the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy storage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While solar may be able to send power to the grid during the day, Dominion Energy said the concern is maintaining enough electricity when the sun isn’t shining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Households will need that power  before the sun comes up in the morning and after it sets in evening, particularly in the wintertime,explained Brandon Martin, manager for power generation business development at Dominion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of legislation, including the 2018 Grid Transformation Act, Dominion is testing several battery storage projects that could be charged during the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a ton of excitement with respect to long duration energy storage, but we need to allow these technologies to develop and evolve and ultimately test those projects before we are able to bet the grid on them,” Martin said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy efficiency</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy efficiency obviates the need for peak demand, as do demand-side management programs, which can reduce the amount of electricity needed to be generated in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VCEA requires Dominion to reduce its electricity sales by 5%, and Appalachian Power Company by 2%, through energy efficiency measures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy has had over a million participants in their energy efficiency programs equaling over 9,600 gigawatt hours of savings, the equivalent of 800,000 homes, said Mike Hubbard, manager of energy conservation with Dominion Energy.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40887" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/20241118_131344/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40887" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241118_131344-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241118_131344-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241118_131344-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241118_131344-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241118_131344-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241118_131344-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241118_131344-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Will Cleveland, left, speaks during a panel on energy efficiency at the Virginia Clean Economy Act summit. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Cleveland, a former Southern Environmental Law Center attorney now with his own private practice, said “the Virginia Clean Economy Act, doesn&#8217;t work if it doesn&#8217;t deliver you a zero- carbon grid that is both affordable and reliable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we don&#8217;t get all three of those things, it&#8217;s not going to work and it&#8217;s not a sustainable policy,” Cleveland said. “I think energy efficiency and demand response have a much larger role to play in achieving those … three goals than they do now.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Transmission </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transmission line development is part of the clean energy transition discussion in the state, since the lines could deliver power across greater distances of land as fossil fuel facilities come offline and new renewable sources are added to the grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New approaches are being considered, including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 1920 to enable more comprehensive planning and the use of grid enhancing technologies, or GETs, to increase the capacity of existing transmission lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But including local input upfront could help avoid barriers to transmission projects, said Tom Rutigliano, senior advocate of climate &amp; energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s only in the last step before pouring concrete that there&#8217;s actual engagement with the public on transmission lines,” said Rutigliano. “You couldn&#8217;t design a better way to have transmission lines run into problems.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Business needs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New businesses that are about to make the commonwealth their home are eying the energy discussion and gauging how long it may take to receive adequate power supply. Clean energy manufacturers LS Greenlink and Microporous just announced they are establishing operations in the state, said Jas El Koubi, director of the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For every $1 of incentives invested into luring businesses to the state, about $8 is returned in the first five years, El Koubi said, adding that about 90% of the state&#8217;s general fund for various priorities comes from sales and income taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Many businesses prefer clean energy once available and cost concerns are addressed, with a wide variety of clean energy considerations at play in those cases,” El Koubi said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those growing business needs are also top of mind for the administration of Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The governor appointed Glenn Davis to be Virginia Energy director, whose approach to meeting the state’s energy demands mirrors Youngkin’s “All of the above” stance, including utilizing natural gas. At the summit, Davis reiterated the Virginia Clean Economy Act’s ban on natural gas and timelines to transition to a carbon-free grid should be lifted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While environmental groups and others say demand can be met with renewable energy and efficiency measures, Davis told the crowd, “We need to have additional natural gas built. It just is what it is.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot have an affordable, reliable and increasingly clean grid without more natural gas built in the commonwealth of Virginia,” Davis said. “If anyone has a model that shows you can, please let me know.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans have gained control of the Oval Office and both chambers of Congress, the conservative playbook called Project 2025 may be closer to becoming a reality. It includes a </span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-12.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chapter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose author has ties to Virginia’s energy laws and regulation creation process, and that calls for major overhauls to the U.S. Department of Energy, including repealing clean energy funding sources, increasing oil and gas production and streamlining the nuclear approval process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, put together Project 2025 in anticipation of a Trump presidency that will begin Jan. 20, 2025. The energy chapter was written by Richmond-based McGuireWoods lobbyist Bernard McNamee, who did not return requests for comment on this article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump denied connections to Project 2025 on the campaign trail. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump and Vice President J.D. Vance’s transition team, told The Mercury Nov. 14 &#8220;no policy should be deemed official unless it comes directly from President Trump.” On Friday, Trump </span><a href="https://x.com/kleavittnh/status/1857518231076159736/photo/1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum would not only be Secretary of the Interior, but also </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-rapidly-unveils-appointments-cabinet-staff-posts-dizzying-post-election-week" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chairman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a “newly formed” National Energy Council that will “oversee a path to U.S. ENERGY DOMINANCE.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we provide an overview of the energy and environmental implications of Project 2025, should it come to pass.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Repealing landmark federal legislation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 54-page  energy chapter of Project 2025 calls for repeals to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, which have funneled millions to Virginia for a range of initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNamee proposes to “Support repeal of massive spending bills like the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which established new programs and are providing hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to renewable energy developers, their investors, and special interests, and support the rescinding of all funds not already spent by these programs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to filings with the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, Dominion Energy, the largest provider of electricity in the state, has </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/815601!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applied </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for about $769 million in BIL and IRA funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While noting all that funding hasn’t been awarded, the utility said “Any incremental credit or grant that the Company receives as a result of the IRA or IIJA will be passed on to customers through lower project costs.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power Company, the state’s second largest utility, has </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/814r01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applied </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for about $79 million, while noting it would submit an application for funding provided by the </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program#:~:text=Program%20Announcements,supplier%20development%2C%20and%20site%20preparation." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BIL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support the development of a small modular reactor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, that pursuit of SMR funding took a step forward with Appalachian Power Company </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/13/virginias-largest-megasite-lands-the-biggest-project-southside-has-ever-seen-after-years-of-trying/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it identified a site for the smaller form of a nuclear reactor on company-owned property in Campbell County. The company, “plans to apply for part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s $900 million grant program to accelerate the deployment of SMRs and help reduce customer costs,” a release on the announcement stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other recent examples of federal funding flowing to Virginia include the Wednesday announcement that </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/13/virginias-largest-megasite-lands-the-biggest-project-southside-has-ever-seen-after-years-of-trying/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microporous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a battery parts manufacturer, committed to opening a plant in Pittsylvania County after receiving a $100 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy with funding from the BIL. The company picked the location over other </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/virginia-develops-workforce-as-demand-for-electrification-grows/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">southeastern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the summer, city of Richmond Public Schools received </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/richmond-public-schools-warner-kaine/article_9ec690ee-5444-11ef-bd3a-271298eb87a1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$15 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve buildings’ energy efficiency and improve air quality in schoolhouses, which suffered from visible signs of mold, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promoting fossil fuels</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another core premise of the chapter is the goal to increase  fossil fuel use, which Republicans and utilities say is needed  amid growing energy needs, but scientists and environmental professors say is counter intuitive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNamee recommends a change to the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, if it can’t be eliminated, to “increasing energy security and supply through fossil fuels.” The author also wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to “recommit itself to the (National Gas Act)’s purpose of providing the people with access to affordable and reliable natural gas.” The National Gas Act, or NGA was passed to regulate natural gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The new energy crisis is caused not by a lack of resources, but by extreme ‘green’ policies,” McNamee wrote.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paul Bubbosh, adjunct professor at George Mason University, wrote the “energy crisis” that the author purports isn’t real, citing information from the Energy Information Agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, crude oil prices will remain </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61222" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 2024 and 2025,” </span><a href="https://cesp.gmu.edu/review-of-heritage-foundation-project-2025-department-of-energy-related-emissions-chapter-12/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Bubbosh in a blog post on the school’s website. “Further, the U.S. is setting </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in crude oil production. Natural gas prices may have a slight increase in the same time frame (2024-2025), but </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61385" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are well below crises markers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists say climate change is propelled by human-created emissions from fossil fuel use. Cale Jaffe, director of the environmental law and community engagement clinic at the University of Virginia, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">published an </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3217107" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Georgetown Environmental Law Review citing a 2015 Department of Defense analysis under the administration of President Barack Obama that said climate change is “present security threat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It highlighted that climate change will ‘aggravate existing problems — such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation,’” Jaffe wrote. “For this reason, the Department of Defense labeled climate change as a ‘threat multiplier.’ Studies from the National Academy of Sciences and the Union of Concerned Scientists have further highlighted the national security risks associated with climate change.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Increasing nuclear </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third pillar of the playbook’s energy plan suggests easing the path to bringing more nuclear resources online, seen by some Virginia policy makers as critical to meet energy demands, but that also come with their environmental concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNamee wants to “increase the level of private-sector responsibility for the disposal of nuclear waste,” and continue with Yucca Mountain being a central repository of waste after that idea was halted amid state </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/04/11/america-nuclear-waste-san-onofre/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also called for reforms under the Office of Nuclear Energy to “reduce regulatory obstacles,” and for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to “expedite the review and approval of license extensions of existing reactors, which will require the NRC to streamline and focus its (National Environmental Policy Act) review process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, being at the epicenter of data center development in the country, is faced with skyrocketing energy demands, prompting discussion about using carbon-free small modular reactors to maintain a reliable grid while achieving emission reduction goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has pushed for SMRs since the unveiling of his “All-of-the-Above” energy plan in 2022. This past year, the Democratic-controlled legislature passed  bills with bipartisan support that would allow Virginia&#8217;s two largest utilities to recover from ratepayers the pre-construction costs to bring an SMR online.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39239" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/11/dominion-seeking-small-nuclear-reactor-proposals/img_3877/" rel="attachment wp-att-39239"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39239" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3877-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Republican Gov. Glenn Younkin speaks during at Dominion&#8217;s North Anna Power Station. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Republican spokesperson Garren Shipley reiterated to the Mercury leading stances from GOP lawmakers this past session: that solar and wind can’t provide enough electricity on its own. Shipley also noted that Germany&#8217;s decommissioning of nuclear power plants was met with reactivating coal plants, though those are now being again shut down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reliability is a major concern for any system that relies on wind and solar for their baseload power,” Shipley said. “Energy demand doesn’t stop when the wind calms or the sun goes down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Democrats have supported a diverse energy mix that includes nuclear, including Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But…there are significant problems with SMRs” he said, pointing to costs and waste, when discussing a failed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB741" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington. The bill would’ve changed approval of the technology to a streamlined Virginia Department of Environmental Quality process instead of at the SCC level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez also pointed out that “…we don&#8217;t have a solution for spent fuel rods,” acknowledging that waste from the existing, traditional nuclear power station at North Anna can be stored at that location, but Yucca Mountain isn’t available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;re talking about SMRs dotted across the Commonwealth in a perfect world…that&#8217;s got significant unintended consequences, in terms of drinking water, clean water, and what do you do with the spent fuel rods?”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia congressional representatives support federal funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enacting parts of Project 2025’s energy chapter and Trump’s stance on energy would require action from Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump repeatedly urged the country to “drill baby drill” for more oil during his campaign, and made </span><a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-speech-political-rally-chesapeake-virginia-june-28-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statements </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a Chesapeake </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rally </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that correlated offshore wind with whale deaths, though scientists attribute other reasons for the fatalities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, in the minority of the incoming Senate, supports federal funding sources for clean energy, like the IRA signed by President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things you’ve got to give the Biden administration credit on is the IRA funding, whether it&#8217;s battery technology, or whether it is solar panels,” Warner said during a press briefing. “Most of that has gone to states that voted, in many cases overwhelming for President Trump. You’re going to shut down those manufacturing facilities?”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/18/how-would-project-2025s-energy-implications-manifest-in-virginia/img_0458/" rel="attachment wp-att-40871"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-40871" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_0458-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, a newly-re-elected Republican representing the Virginia Beach area where Dominion Energy is building the nation’s largest offshore wind farm, couldn’t be reached for comment, but earlier this year, she signed on to a </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4815990-mike-johnson-ira-clean-energy-tax-credits/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sent to Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, urging him not to repeal tax credits in the IRA, which have gone to </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">businesses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in her district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner, a proponent of nuclear power generation, said not pursuing offshore wind power generation as carbon-free source “would be a mistake.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think about the manufacturing components that go into offshore wind, we can be the country&#8217;s leader,” Warner said. “This is where the future of energy in the world is headed, and we need to have American competitors and American players in that sector.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State level impact</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A press secretary for Gov. Glenn Youngkin declined to comment on the administration&#8217;s support for Project 2025’s energyplan or any policy proposals that may be introduced in the upcoming legislative session that align with it or Trump’s energy stances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has pushed for re-evaluations of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law seeking to decarbonize the grid by mid-century, and promoted both a proposed natural gas facility and Dominion’s Offshore Wind farm to meet energy demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Energy Director Glenn Davis, a former Republican legislator who was appointed by Youngkin to his current position, said in an interview he expects to see a “resurgence of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/19/youngkin-joins-energy-choice-coalition-with-other-republican-governors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for people’s energy supply.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Additionally, I think you&#8217;re going to see a focus on ensuring that we have an All-of-the-Above policy,” Davis said. “I think it&#8217;ll be more of a focus on data and in reality, as opposed to a feel good scenario.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Democrats in control of the state legislature, the impacts of the chapter and Trump’s federal agenda becoming a reality may be difficult to weather in Virginia.  Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, a patron of the VCEA, previously said he sees “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/sen-marsden-to-host-summit-on-virginia-clean-economy-act-next-week/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no reason</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to stray away from the goals of the law.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some environmental advocates and a conservative policy group see the VCEA as a roadblock to Project 2025’s energy chapter being implemented in the commonwealth — but for different reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has already committed to decarbonization — for example through the Virginia Clean Economy Act that requires our major utilities to be carbon free by 2045 or 2050 with limited exception,” said Nate Benforado, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. He added Virginia also has the “Virginia Environmental Justice Act on the books” to make sure the state is “protecting environmental justice and fenceline communities.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Haner, a senior fellow for environment and energy policy at the Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, stated in a recent </span><a href="https://www.thomasjeffersoninst.org/trumps-energy-promises-face-hurdles-in-anti-hydrocarbon-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Dominion’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project that is set to be complete in 2026 would “likely retain” IRA benefits, because removing them “greatly increase the ultimate cost to consumers for building and maintaining the turbines.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the VCEA mandates will continue the transition to renewable sources, increasing costs to ratepayers, Haner added. Despite </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/wind-solar-levelized-cost-electricity-drop/730533/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of renewable energy decreasing, Hanerr said natural gas still looks “attractive,” with solar and onshore wind as “reasonable choices” that have limited use.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately, Virginia’s voters need to demand a change in direction in Richmond to match the return to sanity in Washington,” Haner wrote.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin said in a press briefing Thursday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor provided an update on the state’s continued recovery from the storm, which hit Virginia Sept. 27 and caused serious damage to Southwest Virginia, with the New River rising to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/08/hurricane-helene-flooded-the-radford-army-ammunition-plant-releasing-chemicals-into-the-new-river/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">31 feet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in one location and three people left dead. Youngkin also shared the state’s difficulty in getting in touch with storm survivors who need assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oftentimes there is an interaction necessary, and that interaction sometimes is around the fact that there are elements that people have filed for that don’t qualify for individual assistance,” Youngkin said. “Sometimes we just need to speak with people and let them know that so that they can get their application correct.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40858" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/20241114_155822/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40858" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1430" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-300x168.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-1024x572.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-768x429.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-1536x858.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241114_155822-2048x1144.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin speaks with reporters on Hurricane Helene recovery efforts. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of a request that isn’t eligible for recovery funding is the cost of food in a refrigerator that was lost, Youngkin said. Insurance payments that exceed what the Federal Emergency Management Agency aid would cover also nixes federal assistance. Sometimes officials just need more information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re getting a phone call from a 202 number, which is (the area code for) Northern Virginia, Washington D.C. area, and you keep hitting no, chances are it could be an inspector that&#8217;s trying to call you or an applicant service assistant that’s trying to help you get your registration complete,” said FEMA Federal Coordinating Officer Timothy Phiel. “If you get a letter, consider that an invitation to come back to our (disaster recovery center). Please come back and see us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state has eight disaster recovery centers set up to help with the ongoing response to Helene, which also caused power outages for Appalachian Power customers that peaked at about 282,000 and roadways like </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/federal-government-sends-virginia-10-million-for-route-58-repair-after-hurricane-helene-washout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Route 58</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be washed away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 10,000 applications for individual assistance have been filed with about $10.5 million paid out already, Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirty six localities have been approved for public assistance, which offsets the costs for emergency responses and cleanup, Youngkin said. Roanoke County is working to be added to that list. Some 93 applications for public assistance have been received, with 19 approved and $20 million already disbursed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 270 farmers have been helped through Farm Recovery Centers, which were set up to help with what the Virginia Cooperative Extension said was over $159 million of </span><a href="https://news.vt.edu/articles/2024/10/cals-vce-final-hurricane-estimate.html#:~:text=Almost%20a%20month%20after%20the,agents%20working%20across%2021%20localities." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to agricultural producers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal </span><a href="https://www.vaemergency.gov/recover/hurricane-helene" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debris </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be removed from seven counties starting next week, Youngkin added. Claytor Lake remains a priority; so far, about 10% of the debris has been pulled out of it. The state has received $59 million for flood mitigation and hazard mitigation projects to “prevent future damage from future emergencies,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aggregate damage from the storm is still to be totaled, Youngkin said. The figure will be shared with the White House and Congress next week to spur additional funding from the Small Business Administration, the Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Called the Virginia Grid Innovation Summit, Google and Virginia Energy led the summit with speeches from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Virginia Energy Director Glenn Davis, Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, and a representative of Dominion Energy, with several energy-related companies and nonprofits in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a spokesperson for Google, the summit was closed to the public to allow attendees to speak in “candor” and “have a more in depth conversation.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the summit covered</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s summit was the latest gathering of energy industry professionals talking about data center growth in the state. Past events include the Virginia Clean Energy Summit, a Loudoun County Chamber of Commerce </span><a href="https://www.loudounnow.com/news/industry-leaders-talk-innovative-energy-solutions-at-chamber-forum/article_f5f0bfe2-96f8-11ef-9bc1-7f5c97364b25.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and next week, Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, will convene the Virginia Clean Economy Act </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/sen-marsden-to-host-summit-on-virginia-clean-economy-act-next-week/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With support from the Virginia Department of Energy, these industry leaders have come together to collaborate on a broad set of cutting edge solutions which will further cement Virginia’s legacy as a global technology hub and continue to power Virginia forward,” said Gary Demasi, global director of data center energy and location strategy at Google, in a news release.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants discussed different types of energy that could be used to supply power for data centers, including SMRs, hydroelectricity and battery storage, according to attendees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers are the warehouses storing computers processing the internet and about 70% of those existing in the world are located in Virginia. Continued development of data centers is expected to more than double peak electricity needs in Dominion’s service territory, from 22 gigawatts this year to 45 megawatts by 2039. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The additional amounts of renewable, nuclear and natural gas electricity generation facilities Dominion is proposing to meet the expected 5.5% annual load growth during that time frame could lead to electric bills for a typical residential customer using 1,000 kilowatts of energy to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from about $142.77 to $214.24 per month by the end of 2039.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google previously announced a $1 billion </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state earlier this year to expand its data center campuses. Amazon and Dominion Energy announced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/amazon-announces-deal-with-dominion-energy-to-develop-a-small-nuclear-reactor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month to develop a small modular reactor, or SMR, to meet energy needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Growth in power demand presents a tremendous opportunity to evolve a stronger, more reliable energy system – these investments will both support Virginia’s economy and strengthen our country’s national security,” said Davis, with Virginia Energy, in the news release. “No one entity can tackle this challenge on their own, so bringing everyone to the table is a critical step towards developing the right portfolio of solutions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy, according to the news release, spoke about grid-enhancing technologies, or GET’s, which are ways to upgrade existing transmission lines to deliver more electricity without building new lines across communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of last year, the utility had added or replaced 800 miles of transmission lines with advanced conductor technology, giving those cables an ability to carry </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Dominion-GET-fact-sheet.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50% more electricity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is also deploying dynamic line rate technology for about 27 lines in the Northern Virginia region, where data centers in the state are largely concentrated, to optimize how much electricity can be carried in different climate conditions.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cOAchcH0X5"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/virginia-environmental-regulators-make-info-on-data-center-operations-more-publicly-accessible/">Virginia environmental regulators make info on data center operations more publicly accessible</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been a leading pioneer on grid enhancing technologies for many years, including advanced conductors, and we continue deploying the latest innovations to enhance reliability and bring more clean energy on the grid,” said Ed Baine, President of Dominion Energy Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google also announced Tuesday that it will contribute $250,000 to the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council’s effort to train workers on energy efficiency, which is the idea of sealing up homes and upgrading appliances to require less electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Called the </span><a href="https://vaeec.org/programs/workforce/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy Efficiency Workforce Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the VEEC began the effort two years ago when a signature component of President Joe Biden’s landmark climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, included tax breaks for the installation of modern heat pumps instead of older HVAC technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EEWI has teamed up with Community Housing Partners and expects to help 24 workers in the Central and Northern Virginia regions achieve by the end of the year state certification to make weatherization upgrades by the end of the year.  Their work will make homes more energy efficient by improving roofs, insulation and windows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding from Google will also allow the VAEEC to offer energy efficiency training for other skilled trades, like electricians and plumbers, and expand their weatherization training statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Google’s support for energy efficiency job training comes at a critical time as we ramp up to meet the growing demand for these jobs,” said Chelsea Harnish, Executive Director of the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council. “Allowing the Council to expand our programs statewide will make a tremendous difference in helping the Commonwealth train and certify the needed energy efficiency workforce of the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next month, the state’s Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission is expected to release a wide range of policy recommendations concerning energy, water and land use needs for data centers.</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> This story was updated to correct that the Energy Efficiency Workforce Initiative will help workers in the Central and Northern Virginia regions of the state by the end of the year.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since DEQ&#8217;s permits are not filed by industry type (i.e., factory or data center), it is very time consuming to locate and pull permits for each data center when they are requested,” said Irina Calos, a spokeswoman for DEQ. “Furthermore, these permits are too large to send through email, necessitating the use of a large file transfer program to send. By placing these permits on our website, we are able to ameliorate these hurdles.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The webpage comes after other transparency initiatives have been introduced under DEQ Director Mike Rolband, including the creation of the Permit Enhancement and Evaluation Platform, or </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-launches-platform-to-make-environmental-permit-info-public/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEEP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a precursor of the Virginia Permitting Transparency </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/25/youngkin-unveils-new-permit-transparency-website/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ has come under increasing scrutiny as data centers, the warehouses storing computers that process internet activity, proliferate in Virginia and present unprecedented energy and water demands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emissions from diesel generators have become a big part of the discussion on data center development, with DEQ last year considering a variance to reduce pollution requirements on the generators in light of electricity transmission delays. The request was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/department-of-environmental-quality-withdraws-proposed-variance-for-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">withdrawn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with a solution identified between the industry and the regional grid operator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past legislative session, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, and Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, introduced </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB116" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would’ve banned the use of diesel for onsite power generation in order to receive the tax credits the state is deploying to lure in more data centers. Both measures failed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over diesel generators stem from the tiny particulate matter in their emissions. The American Medical Association found that long-term exposure to PM 2.5 was linked with </span><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2801820" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased risk of heart issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noise from data centers is also part of the discussion. Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, introduced a bill intended to control how loud facilities are and prevent </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB288" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">generators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from running 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/news/board-supervisors-approve-new-data-center-zoning-ordinance-amendment#:~:text=Equipment%20such%20as%20back%2Dup,allowed%20with%20special%20exception%20approval." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Fairfax County passed an ordinance to limit the noise from data centers, including requiring that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">back-up generators must be 300 feet from the lot line of residential property or separated from the lot line of a residential district or residential property by the data center building.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DEQ webpage lists 177 air permits as of Nov. 12. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An analysis by the Virginia Mercury found that 155 are in the northern region of the state, with 16 in the Piedmont, and two each in the Valley, Southwest and Tidewater regions. Loudoun County has 85 permits, with Fairfax County having 34 and Prince William County having 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon facilities make up 42 of the permits, and Microsoft has 14. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The oldest air </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/25698/638628519198400000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">permit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dates back to Nov. 22, 2000 for the “RREEF America REIT II Corp. VVV,” data center in Fairfax County. The air </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/sho" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">permit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the Hayden Data Center in Loudoun County lists over 150 diesel generators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Permits are not issued if a facility would cause emission exceedances above state and federal air quality limits, Calos said, and require onsite inspections to view records. A majority of the permits issued are Minor New Source Review, or mNSR ones, instead of State Operating Permits, or SOPs, which are for smaller facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As data centers have increased in size, mNSR permits have been issued more frequently, as they allow for new controls and emissions limits,” said Calos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Piedmont Environmental Council, a nonprofit focused on preserving the Piedmont region’s rural landscapes, has a </span><a href="https://www.pecva.org/uncategorized/data-centers-diesel-generators-and-air-quality-pec-web-map/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of air permits for data centers last updated in 2023. The group lauded the creation of DEQ’s website so, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reporters, academics, and other nonprofits no longer need to repeatedly request this information through Freedom of Information Act requests.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are over 12 gigawatts worth of capacity in these permits with the vast majority consolidated in the relatively small and highly populated area of northern Virginia,” said Julie Bolthouse, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">director of land use</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at PEC. “What is the total amount of additional pollution if all were to operate on an emergency basis during an ozone </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/our-programs/air/monitoring-assessments/air-quality-forecast#:~:text=An%20exceedance%20occurs%20when%20an,Kristen%20Stumpf%2C%20or%20Mike%20Kiss." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> period and what would be the public health impact? We deserve to know this basic information.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition that represents members of the industry, said diesel generators “typically operate infrequently and under limited conditions, including during manufacturer-specified testing and maintenance activities.” The generators are needed, Levi said, in order to ensure companies can provide “uninterrupted operations and provide essential connectivity and data flow to their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Data centers are actively evaluating alternatives that can provide similar reliability, fuel availability, siting flexibility, and workplace safety protections,” Levi said. “As an interim measure, many data centers are looking to low-carbon fuel alternatives, including </span><a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/renewable-diesel" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renewable diesel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where available.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Transportation announced the next round of recipients to receive federal funding to build electric vehicle charging stations along interstates and state highways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The awardings, presented by VDOT to the Commonwealth Transportation Board at its Oct. 22 </span><a href="https://ctb.virginia.gov/media/ctb/agendas-and-meeting-minutes/2024/oct/14-nevi-phase-1b-ctb.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, total about $22 million for chargers at 35 different locations from 19 different applicants, six of which are the recipients for more than one location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding comes from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Program, which is part of the bipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Act and which awarded Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/21/what-virginia-wants-to-do-with-100-million-in-electric-vehicle-charging-money/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$106 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for electric vehicle charging stations built over a five-year period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stations will be fast-charging with at least four ports, built within federally-designated “alternative fuel corridors” alongside interstate and highways, and be located within a 50-mile distance from the next charger.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The buildout of the electric vehicle charging stations is seen as critical to the adoption of electric vehicles to reduce climate changing emissions from tailpipes. In Virginia and the rest of the country, about one-third of planet-warming gasses come from the transportation sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as drivers have concerns over how far they can drive electric vehicles within the current charging station network, particularly in rural areas, automakers have scaled back pledges to transition fleet offerings from gas to fully electric cars. Some Republican politicians,, including Gov. Glenn Youngkin, have scaled </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/16/virginia-businesses-weigh-benefits-of-electrification-as-leaders-review-policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democratic desires to require new car sales be electric starting in 2035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/02/vdot-announces-sites-for-electric-vehicle-charging-stations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, VDOT announced the initial awarding of about $11 million for 18 different locations along interstates. The latest funding round expands EV charging options along interstates and adds new locations on state highways. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them are six stations along Interstate 64, one on Interstate 66, two along Interstate 77, two along Interstate 81, one on Interstate 85 and three along Interstate 95. On the state highway front, six are proposed for Route 17, two for Route 23, six for Route 29 and five for Route 460.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest charging stations are proposed for a variety of location types, including 63% at convenience stores and gas stations and travel centers, 17% at hotels and motels, 11% at dining and shopping/grocery stores and 9% at “new construction or other” locations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mix of electric vehicle charging station developers and gas stations, like Wawa, are among the recipients. The average award is about $647,657 with applicants providing an average match amount of about 36% of the total project cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed awards are subject to environmental reviews, an applicant’s desire to continue, site host agreements and other factors before coming online, but VDOT officials presented to the CTB a timeline of issuing notices to proceed between March and May of next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/in-va-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-development-is-underway-incentives-could-spur-growth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, VDOT officials told The Mercury that the charging station build-out was expected to be completed within two years of when a notice to proceed is issued. But supply chain issues around transformers, which are needed to deliver power from the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/virginias-electric-vehicle-transition-depends-on-the-power-grid-how-is-it-faring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to specific locations, added a six to 18- month delay on the completion of projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the first charger for the initial round of stations is expected to be in use by the end of this year, installation of chargers from this second round of funding could begin next year and extend into 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOT is planning to use future NEVI funds to meet the every 50-mile requirement, including stations on Route 17 and Route 29 south of Warrenton and Route 460 east of Appomattox County. Remaining funds may be used for Phase 2 opportunities, including chargers for tractor-trailers.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The landmark law Virginia passed in 2020 to decarbonize the electric grid is being tested, as energy demand from data centers surges, prompting discussions about how to meet the law’s goal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Nov. 18, Sen. David Marsden, D-Fairfax, is hosting a </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/005ceb5f201/c06272f5-4fac-4747-8e77-8e1ed319f5e4.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Richmond to talk about that law, the Virginia Clean Economy Act, and a wide range of related topics including economic considerations, challenges limiting local approvals for solar projects, energy efficiency, delivering energy through transmission lines and small modular nuclear reactors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The summit will be the culmination of discussions involving Marsden’s office that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/05/foia-friday-chesterfield-foia-policy-scrutiny-king-george-data-center-park-debate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would be exempt from Freedom of Information Act laws under a working papers exception, in order to allow for more candid conceptual discussions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not touching the act,” said Marsden, in a previous phone interview with the Mercury. “The act itself is fine. What are the circumstances around it that have changed in four years and how do we adjust to that demand?” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Up for discussion: SMRs, solar and local land use considerations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Clean Economy Act, a policy passed under a Democratic trifecta control of state government, requires Virginia’s two largest utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, to decarbonize the grid by 2045 and 2050, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the growing demand from data centers is expected to increase the electricity needs from Dominion’s current peak amount of about 22,000 megawatts to about 45,000 by 2039. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to filings at the State Corporation commission, Appalachian Power had a 2023 peak load of  about 3,200 megawatts. The utility is currently planning to add about 7,700 megawatts for large load customers, about half of which are data centers.</span></p>

Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, at the North Anna Power Station (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small modular reactors, which are smaller nuclear reactors able to produce about 300 megawatts, have gained appeal because of their ability to provide baseload power without generating carbon emissions. Though one is yet to be used commercially in the United States, Amazon announced recently it would help pay for Dominion to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/amazon-announces-deal-with-dominion-energy-to-develop-a-small-nuclear-reactor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">develop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As SMRs potentially become viable, Marsden’s summit attendees will discuss other possible power-producing solutions, including </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/solar-developers-seeking-changes-to-local-siting-process-again/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar energy development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some participants have previously advocated for altering the local approval process for solar projects by giving state officials the authority to override local denials, by creating a regional siting board or developing a state-level task force to support localities and regions by offering an opinion on technical guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do not want to diminish local opinion, and we do not want to fail in the task of accelerating permanent approvals,” said Jay Ford, Virginia Policy Manager at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a group that wants to see less emissions trickle down into the Bay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s no doubt about it that if we&#8217;re going to hit our targets, we&#8217;ve got to accelerate utility scale solar being built out, but we have to do it in a way that doesn&#8217;t cause blowback and grind the whole thing to a halt,” Ford said in an interview after presenting the opinion idea to the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation on Thursday. “We&#8217;re trying to strike that balance right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major concern of localities and the farming community faced with Chesapeake Bay cleanup requirements and challenging economics: the loss of farmland to solar. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36197" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/06/virginia-plan-projects-universal-broadband-access-by-2028/img_7178/" rel="attachment wp-att-36197"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36197" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_7178-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A Southside Virginia farm. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Greg Habeeb, a lobbyist on behalf of the Solar Energy Industries Association, Advanced Energy United and several solar developers shared numbers, told legislators at the CEUR meeting that only about 2,400, or 3%, of the 97,000 acres of prime farmland lost annually on average has been due to solar energy development, which is in line with numbers from the Department of Environmental Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Renewable energy is not the problem,” Habeeb said. “Other land use decisions are the problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s the concern over the loss of </span><a href="https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/murp_capstone/41/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forestland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said Kyle Shreeve, a lobbyist speaking on behalf of the Virginia Forestry Association, during the CEUR meeting, and “removing local land use authority makes conservation efforts much more difficult.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think the regional planning outline, as Mr. Ford has presented, definitely has potential and could be a potential vehicle to work through some of these issues,” Shreeve said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other topics of discussion at the summit — such as increasing energy efficiency to build homes and businesses that require less energy, increasing distributed generation on the ground and more comprehensive planning  for transmission lines to deliver power across broader regions — have been proposed by environmental and energy groups.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Natural gas</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of natural gas isn’t on the summit’s agenda, but it is, but often brought up in discussions of the VCEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the projected electricity demand, Dominion wants to build a natural gas plant and is planning for more, alongside a suite of renewable energy projects, to provide dispatchable reliable power to maintain the grid when solar and wind can’t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental and ratepayer groups see that as running counter to VCEA, since natural gas facilities are required to come offline under the law unless there’s a concern over grid reliability. If that concern is present, Dominion and Appalachian Power can appeal to the State Corporation Commission regulators to keep a carbon-emitting source, like its planned natural gas plant, online.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I see no reason for us to give up on that very important state mandated goal,” said Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, one of the lead sponsors of the VCEA. “We can, and as far as I’m concerned, will meet that goal. I have confidence in Virginia and Virginians. When we set a goal we meet our goal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although natural gas is not listed as a discussion topic for the summit, Glenn Davis, a former Republican legislator and now director of Virginia Energy appointed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said in an interview a key consideration is “getting rid of the banning of natural gas as we look forward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The specific policies will be coming out over the next 45 days or so from the administration,” said Davis.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has acknowledged the challenge of being able to provide power through solar, given recent analysis that gave it a lower effective load carrying capacity, meaning solar produces less power than previously thought. The utility is relying on the provision in the VCEA that allows for carbon emitting sources to stay online if need be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re quite confident that we will make that case, but it will be up to the State Corporation Commission to decide that,“ Dominion Energy chair, president and CEO Bob Blue said in a recent interview with reporters about its long-term plan, called an integrated resource plan, which increases natural gas usage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a company that complies with the law. We are doing that in this integrated resource plan. We’re going to do that moving forward,” Blue said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power, in a statement, said it “will continue to work with regulators, developers, localities and other interested parties to meet the Virginia Clean Economy Act requirements.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are committed to meeting those requirements without compromising the reliability, affordability, or security of the electric power system,” said spokesperson George Porter.</span></p>

(Image courtesy of Chris Finley/BAE Systems)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/one-dead-five-va-communities-under-voluntary-evacuation-order-from-tropical-depression-helene/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Sept. 27, Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc on the Southwest Virginia region, including flooding the Radford Army Ammunition Plant and causing the release of chemicals in the New River, according to the plant and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a spokesperson for the Radford Army Ammunition Plant, the facility “experienced significant flooding due to Hurricane Helene,” when the nearby New River crested at 31 feet the day after the storm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Due to areas of the plant being submerged, we’ve now identified the potential release of calcium sulfate and petroleum into the waterway and disclosed such instances to DEQ,” said Laura McLaughlin, a spokesperson for BAE Systems, the company that operates the plant, in an Oct. 26 email to the Mercury. “However, at this time, we do not believe there is a risk to public health or wildlife.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a pollution </span><a href="https://portal.deq.virginia.gov/prep/prepReport/315991" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed with the DEQ, as of Monday, the “total confirmed release estimate” of dibutyl phthalate —a liquid plasticizer that is also found in nail polish, hair spray and raincoats — “is now 225 gallons,” stored in tote containers at the plant that were carried away by the river.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flooding event came as the plant seeks a </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1073679164283740/?ref=newsfeed" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">variance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to accept and recycle acid waste, in lieu of acid RAAP already buys and uses. The move has prompted environmental groups to say the plant isn’t being fully transparent with the community and skirting stringent regulations, and is at risk for future flooding events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they provided more information, we would be able to understand it on a deeper level,” said Alyssa Carpenter, with the Citizens for Arsenal Accountability, which wants the request denied, or the process restarted with more information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But that doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s going to alleviate our concerns, because it&#8217;s hazardous waste,” said Carpenter, who had her thyroid removed after years of living near the plants and is “still seeing doctors.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The plant</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Radford Army Ammunition Plant, or RAAP, has been in Radford, a half hour from Roanoke, since 1940, manufacturing propellants for the U.S. Army munitions and rockets under a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the years, the plant has come under scrutiny for its discarding of waste through open burning, which releases  pollutants in the air. Two years ago, the Citizens for Arsenal Accountability produced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/11/citizen-group-pushes-for-halt-to-open-burning-at-radford-army-ammunition-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlining the concern.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The flooding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flooding led to the release of potentially up to 127,500 pounds of calcium </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0095.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sulfate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wastewater and up to 700 gallons of diesel, said Justine Barati, chief of public and congressional affairs at Joint Munitions Command. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of DPB came from four containers found in the area after 13, each holding 275 gallons for a total storage of 3,575 gallons of DPB, were “lifted up and carried away” from the plant, Barati explained. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no concern that those chemicals (Calcium Sulfate, petroleum, DBP) released by RAAP are in any Virginia residents&#8217; drinking water,” Franklin said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Preparation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the flooding, the plant moved 14 tractor trailers of material to higher ground, Barati said, and prioritized work, which meant, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the potential impact to employee safety and the environment was greatly reduced.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The containers’ movement “was unexpected, but so was the size of the flood,” Barati said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the flooding, the plant began coordinating with DEQ, the National Response Center, the Department of the Army and local first responders, Barati said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Oct. 26 email from McLaughlin, the BAE Systems spokeswoman, she said, “We are happy to report that all of our employees are safely back at work on site.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Variance request</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As RAAP continues to operate now after the flooding, the plant is seeking a variance to the Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title9/agency20/chapter60/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazardous Waste Management Regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to accept and recycle acid waste, while still following the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-resource-conservation-and-recovery-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resource Conservation and Recovery Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and complying with their air permit, according to DEQ. The plant is asking permission to receive up to 18 million pounds of nitric acid and 9 million pounds of sulfuric acid annually, said Julie Raimondi, a DEQ spokeswoman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is for 100% of the accepted product to be reused, resulting in a “net environmental benefit,” Raimondi said, by requiring less raw material and eliminating hazardous waste. Barati added the plant would “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not be taking on more acid than we otherwise do,” has “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significant and strict controls in place.&#8221; The plant hasn’t heard from DEQ they’re lacking any information, Barati said, and is working on &#8220;modernization projects&#8221; for future flooding, but those &#8220;need to be presented to Army leadership, Department of Defense leadership, and Members of Congress for approval before being announced to the public.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The acid we would accept through this variance request would be in place of acid we would buy through other suppliers, not in addition,” Barati said. “This is an opportunity to re-use a product that is otherwise going to be wasted in a process that we are already currently performing here on the plant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Thien Chau, a senior associate attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental advocacy law group working with Citizens for Arsenal Accountability, said there’s a lack of information in the request for the community to review, including a “consideration of potential cumulative risks from other nearby potential stressors,” as required by the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title9/agency20/chapter60/section1390/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the controls that would be put in place, Chau said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Communities just shouldn&#8217;t be poisoned at all, let alone at the hands of their own government,” Chau said. “The problem we have here is that DEQ wants to grant the arsenal this variance without themselves having the information they need to determine if it&#8217;s going to be protective of human health and the environment, as it&#8217;s DEQ&#8217;s obligation to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RAAP made their variance request before the flooding happened, which “sort of changes the situation based on what risks that poses to us as a community,” Carpenter said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A public comment period will be open until Nov. 25. A community </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1073679164283740/?ref=newsfeed" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the variance request was scheduled for 6:30 p.m. at the Christiansburg Public Library Thursday night. </span></p>

(Courtesy of Vindman for Congress)</p><p>Nearly 24 hours after polls closed on Election Day, the Associated Press on Wednesday evening declared Democrat Eugene Vindman the winner over Republican Derrick Anderson in Virginia&#8217;s hard-fought 7th Congressional District race.</p>
<p>Vindman and Anderson earned about 51% and 49% of the vote, respectively. The race had remained<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/06/virginias-7th-congressional-district-race-remains-too-close-to-call/"> too close to call Tuesday</a> after polls closed at 7 p.m. and for a majority of Wednesday.</p>
<p>“In my 25 years of military service, and when we were jumping out of airplanes, it didn’t matter to me the color creed, background, race, or party affiliation of the person next to me,” said Vindman in a statement declaring victory Tuesday night, before the official call. “What mattered was getting the mission done. That’s the type of service I am going to take to Washington as the next Congressman from Virginia’s 7th Congressional District.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Anderson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the AP’s declaration. On Thursday, Anderson acknowledged the race&#8217;s outcome in a <a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1854630437630488990" target="_blank">post</a> on X: &#8220;<span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3">Earlier today I called (Vindman) </span>to concede the race. I expect him to do everything in his power in Congress to make life better for the people of this district.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 7th District seat went up for grabs after incumbent Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, announced she would run for governor. In 2021, the year before voters in the 7th elected Spanberger, more of the district voted for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin than his Democratic opponent, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe.</p>
<p>Spanberger, in a statement Tuesday, congratulated Vindman on a “well-earned victory,” adding he will, “bring the values, work ethic, and commitment to public service that the Seventh District deserves.”</p>
<p>Though the men hold similar backgrounds through their military service, the race between Vindman and Anderson largely focused on their policy differences.</p>

<p>Vindman voiced strong support for protecting reproductive health rights, easing Virginians’ economic pain by continuing to lower medication costs, and strengthening the nation’s borders.</p>
<p>Anderson supported reducing taxes and immigration reform in his campaign, and said abortion rights are best left up to states. He mirrored several of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s policy stances.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voters of the 7th Congressional district proved just how tight the contest is, by keeping the race between Eugene Vindman and Derrick Anderson too close to call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 99% of votes had been counted, with Vindman and Anderson earning about 51% and 49% of the vote, respectively, but by 10 a.m. Wednesday,  the Associated Press had still not confirmed a winner. </span></p>
<p>“In my 25 years of military service, and when we were jumping out of airplanes, it didn’t matter to me the color creed, background, race, or party affiliation of the person next to me,&#8221; said Vindman in a statement declaring victory, despite the uncertainty of the outcome. &#8220;What mattered was getting the mission done. That’s the type of service I am going to take to Washington as the next Congressman from Virginia’s 7th Congressional District.”</p>
<p>“We knew this was going to be a tight race, folks,” Anderson said in a video <a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1854006484184551766" target="_blank">posted</a> on his X account at 10:42 p.m., before later <a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1854016079905124787" target="_blank">posting</a> the race was &#8220;too close to call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to keep looking, we&#8217;re going to keep watching,&#8221; Anderson said. &#8220;I just ask y&#8217;all give us a little more time and we&#8217;re going to get through this thing.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seat went up for grabs after incumbent Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, announced she would run for governor.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RICHMOND, Va. — On Tuesday morning, outside the Virginia Commonwealth University polling location on the second floor of the Student Commons, several students shared their same-day voter registration experiences and the top policy issues driving their choice between presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Reproductive rights, housing and economic policy were among the young voters’ chief concerns.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Many students use same-day voter registration and provisional ballots</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TriVonda Mines, the chief officer of elections at the VCU Student Commons polling location, the largest precinct in the area, saw a steady flow of voters since the 6 a.m. start, but noted it had not been as busy as previous presidential elections. She expects around 1,800 to 2,100 votes Tuesday, she said, and anticipates at least 300 of those to be provisional ballots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A problem with provisional ballots on college campuses is that students often mix up their residency and home address. Students in residence halls must put their residence address, not their home address, in order to have their vote count in the district, according to Mines. The Commons polling location included a separate area designated for provisional ballots, a ballot used when a voter cannot confirm proper identification or forgot to register in advance.</span></p>

(Katie Farthing/Capital News Service)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jyson Willow, a senior interdisciplinary studies student at VCU, voted using a provisional ballot because he forgot about the registration deadline. Willow moved to the Richmond area over a year ago and still doesn’t have a Virginia license, so he was unable to register online beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it was stressful, just because of the amount of people that were having to do it today,” Willow said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willow said he was glad voting via provisional ballot was easy because choosing a presidential candidate is stressful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s almost like picking the lesser of two evils, because I don’t necessarily align perfectly with one party,” Willow said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caitlin Przywara, a senior information systems student at VCU, also voted using a provisional ballot because she did not originally plan to vote and thought she had missed her chance to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It actually went by pretty fast,” Przywara said. “We didn’t know if we could register, we thought it was too late.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After casting their provisional ballot, voters have until Friday, Nov. 8 at 10 a.m. to provide valid identification, after which the local electoral board decides which provisional ballots will be counted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truesdale, the chief election officer at the George Washington Carver Elementary School, anticipated a majority of provisional ballots. The elementary school is a polling location for two upperclassmen residence halls at VCU. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute of Contemporary Art is a polling location for one VCU residence hall and Chief Officer of Elections Brooks Braun noted a steady flow of voters and anticipated around 60 provisional ballots by the time polls close. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Student voters focused on reproductive health care, housing, economic policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the college students interviewed shared that they voted for Harris, because her policy positions most closely resemble their own.s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with being an advocate for women’s rights, Yurida Martinez, a freshman, said the Harris housing policy plan to provide a $25,000 downpayment for first-time homebuyers appealed to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanessa Lemus, a graduate student, agreed and added, “I really like the credit for first-time homebuyers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m already 26 years old, so (homeownership) is something I want to do in the future, in a couple of years,” Lemus said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemus, who identifies as queer, said Trump’s proposed policy that would expand corporate tax cuts would only help “if you’re making six figures or more.” That, and Trump’s rhetoric disparaging immigrants and others, dissuaded her from voting for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Throughout his presidency, the last time he was president, and throughout the campaign, he really just kind of used harmful rhetoric toward different marginalized groups,” Lemus said. “Not only that, but (Trump) has allowed for people that are voting for him to feel like it’s ok to do as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Przywara did not vote in the 2020 election, but chose to this year because of her dislike for Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve already seen what Trump has done,” Przywara said. “It’s gonna be different, if she (Harris) does become President.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sparse support for Trump Tuesday, Lemus said, is on trend for a liberal campus in an urban center of the state that reliably votes Democratic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a very liberal campus, a very eccentric, collective campus where you have a lot of different types of students coming from different backgrounds, different places,” Lemus said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Advocates say same-day voting tears down barriers for student voters</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same-day registration across Virginia’s college campuses “has been huge,” said Will Winters, state director for NextGen America, a non-partisan advocacy group focused on youth voting. The Virginia legislature passing its same-day registration law in 2020, which took effect in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/13/same-day-voter-registration-is-coming-to-virginia-heres-how-itll-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has “torn down a lot of barriers to voting,” for students, he said. That expanded access leads candidates to engage with young voters more, Winters said, and makes it easier for all citizens to participate in the democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot of people that don’t think about elections ‘til the last second. We see all these ads and we look at polls, but there’s a lot of people in this country that are paying attention to other things,” Winters said in a phone interview from the campus of University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. “If somebody’s moved to a different apartment, maybe they’ve changed cities for a job, same-day registration helps just make that really easy and available for those people to still have a say in our democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winters declined to share how many people NextGen America has registered, but said Millenial and Gen Z voters are going to have a </span><a href="https://www.whro.org/elections/2024-11-03/what-virginias-college-voters-care-most-about-in-presidential-election" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“huge voice”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year. This year’s turnout, he said, is stemming from the high-profile national election, and comes after the group’s work with young voters in 2023 ahead of Virginia’s pivotal General Assembly election where all 140 seats were on the ballot. The group did outreach in Blacksburg, home to Virginia Tech, and the Hampton Roads area, which hosts several universities including Norfolk State and Christopher Newport universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just seems, generally, students are engaged,” Winters said.</span></p>

(izanbar/Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the congressional delegation from Virginia would like to see the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act, or Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, reauthorized when it ends in less than two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BIL has fueled internet access </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-nets-almost-1-5-billion-in-federal-broadband-funds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expansion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and funded several transportation and environmental projects in Virginia, including financially supporting the Long Bridge Project&#8217;s expansion and cleanup efforts at abandoned mine lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law expires on Sept. 30, 2026, leaving a reshaped Congress and new presidential administration to consider its reauthorization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the BIL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was signed into law on Nov. 15, 2021, authorizing $1.2 trillion for transportation and infrastructure spending with $550 billion targeted for “new” investments and programs over six years, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have just entered the fourth fiscal year out of a five-year package, so it&#8217;s not too soon to be talking about what comes next,” said Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg to the media during the Oct. 15 groundbreaking of the Long Bridge Project in Arlington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;ve had in this bipartisan infrastructure package is a level of investment that we&#8217;ve not had in my lifetime, clearly very much needed, especially when you talk about a 100 year-old asset like Long Bridge and thousands of cases like that around the country,” he added. “So we need to, I think, take all of the successes and learn from the experiences of the last few years, and it will very much be one of the biggest things on Congress’ plate in just about a year from now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the groundbreaking ceremony, lawmakers laid out how the act has helped and advocated for the law to be reauthorized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, said the Long Bridge expansion was an example of how the law continues to impact Virginians and “makes good on the promise of investing in our communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, said reauthorizing the law would help address some unmet needs for rail, highways and airports in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we just keep all the folks who voted for it last time and add in all the members of Congress who didn&#8217;t vote for it, but have shown up in ribbon cuttings across the country during the last five years, we&#8217;ll have an 85% passage,” Warner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is also a catch-up for crumbling infrastructure that was allowed to languish and be neglected for a long time,” said Congressman Gerry Connolly, D-Fairfax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lawmakers have had a change of heart concerning BIL. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, had voted against the policy, initially </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402544" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">how much of it was new spending or just reauthorizations of approved funding. Yet, he touted his role in securing a $1.6 million federal grant benefitting the Piedmont Planning District’s Commission’s Route 122 Regional Corridor Plan, which was funded under the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith explained the contradiction by saying “&#8230;once it’s passed into law, I would be failing to do my job if I didn’t then advocate for those federal monies to come to the 9th District,” in a September interview with the Mercury about his </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/27/in-the-fightin-ninth-baker-seeks-to-end-griffiths-13-year-tenure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for re-election in the Southwest Virginia-based district.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Transportation </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and industry leaders in transportation are excited about the future of public transit after millions in BIL federal funding have been dedicated to projects across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danny Plaugher, executive director for Virginians for High-Speed Rail, said the federal government’s $16 billion investment nationwide for rail is making a “huge difference,” eclipsing an earlier record of $2 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, Virginia celebrated the groundbreaking of the Long Bridge expansion project after the commonwealth was awarded $729 million. Once completed, the bridge that connects Washington D.C. and Virginia, will allow for more freight and passenger rail service separation. </span></p>

(Washington D.C. Department of Transportation/ Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current two-track system, widely considered a choke point, has negatively impacted travel times. The plans include expanding to a four-track corridor and constructing approximately 1.8 miles of improvements to rail and pedestrian bridges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaugher said the two largest federal investments for rail before the Act were $74 million in 2009 and $100 million for the Franconia-Springfield Bypass last year. The bypass is an elevated rail bridge south of the Franconia-Springfield station that separates passenger trains from the existing freight tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, across rail and transit services, Plaugher said Virginia has aggressively sought grants for bridge repairs, rail improvement, and safety projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both the railway and transit side have been very aggressive in pursuing opportunities for those competitive grants, and we have also been very successful,” Plaugher said. “And so I think we should be proud of our elected and appointed leaders for ensuring that Virginia gets its fair share, and that good things are happening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to USDOT, Virginia is expected to receive $1.2 billion under the law to improve its public transportation options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investments for Virginia include approximately $386 million for infrastructure development for airports, about $106 million per year over five years to support the expansion of an electric vehicle charging network in the commonwealth, and along with grant opportunities, earn a portion of $2.5 billion.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy &amp; environment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation had a significant impact on environmental issues as well, and is assisting the commonwealth in tackling outdated pipes, supporting electric grid programs and cleaning up abandoned mine lands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the release of incremental amounts of funding for Virginia to upgrade water and gas infrastructure, the BIL provided over $50 million in October to replace those lines in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-protects-communities-lead-drinking-water-announces-more-35" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $35.1 million is headed to Virginia to replace lead drinking water pipes, in line with an administrative rule to identify and replace those lines across the country within 10 years. The announcement comes after the EPA awarded $94 million to Virginia in </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-94-million-virginia-drinking-water-wastewater" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to upgrade drinking water, and wastewater and stormwater infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About $15.7 million out of the U.S Department of Transportation&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration, or PHMSA, is going toward </span><a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/2024-10/FY%202024%20NGDISM%20Grants%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">replacing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 13.25 miles of aging gas mains with polyethylene and cathodically protected steel coated lines in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although environmentalists are critical of maintaining fossil fuel infrastructure, PHMSA said the funding will reduce 22.26 metric tons of methane, the most potent climate change causing greenhouse gas, annually by eliminating leaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers, the energy intensive warehouses storing internet processors, are proliferating in Virginia, prompting electricity generation sources to be built, including  natural gas-run facilities. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Energy had received about $3 million to $4 million annually since 1981 to clean up mine lands, but the BIL increased the coffers by $23 million over the next 15 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AML program exists to clean up mine lands coal companies left unreclaimed, or remediated, before the 1977 Surface Mine Reclamation Act, which now requires sites to be reclaimed, meaning returned to their natural states or revamped for future economic opportunities. Dangers, such as a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/01/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-aiding-virginia-energys-abandoned-mine-cleanup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">landslide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Dickenson County, can result from improper irrigation at AMLs if reclamation doesn&#8217;t happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increased funding is </span><a href="https://www.energy.virginia.gov/public/documents/newsroom/2024/Press_Release_DOI%20Announces%20$22%20MIll%20for%20VA%20AML%20BIL%20funding%2020240325.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow Virginia Energy to reclaim 70% of its inventory of abandoned mines it has found since 1981. That’ll lead to the creation of more than 1,000 jobs, the agency said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Congress considers reauthorizing the law, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, predicted his colleagues could debate turning the act into a longer term investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Six years is going to prove to the American public, and I hope to Congress, of course it&#8217;s worthwhile,” Kaine said. “So my prediction is when we have the reauthorization vote, it&#8217;s going to be by a bigger margin than the first one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Friends of the Chesterfield, a group formed to push back against the plant, held their own &#8220;People&#8217;s Hearing&#8221;  in lieu of a public hearing they’ve requested but that the County Board of Supervisors hasn&#8217;t held.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maria Alvarado, a representative of the Central American Solidarity Association, or CASA, a group advocating on behalf of Black, Latino, Afro-descendent, indigenous, and immigrant communities, called the planned plant “a ticking time bomb” threatening residents’ health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Every breath we take is at risk. It is not just about today, it is about long term health and survival of our community,” Alvarado said in Spanish, a translator rendering her words in English to the crowd. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sustained opposition  </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s hearing was the latest pushback against the 1,000 megawatt natural gas plant that Dominion proposed in 2023. The utility has said the plant will provide power when solar and wind can&#8217;t amid increasing electricity demands from data center development, electrification of vehicles and Virginians’ everyday use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, environmental and community groups, including the local Sunrise Movement, protested outside Dominion&#8217;s Thomas F. Farrell II building in downtown Richmond before dropping off a letter for Dominion Chair, President and CEO Bob Blue asking for alternative energy sources.</span></p>

Farrell II building in downtown Richmond. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the inception of initial plans to build the plant at the James River Industrial Park on Battery Brooke Parkway, community and environmental groups have lambasted the project, saying  it runs counter to the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law that requires the state&#8217;s largest utilities to transition to zero-carbon emitting energy sources by mid-century, unless there is a concern over the ability to meet electricity needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 15 state legislators issued a statement in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/15/democratic-legislators-oppose-dominions-proposed-chesterfield-natural-gas-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the plant in May, four delegates attended the People’s Hearing Tuesday night, including Del. Rodney Willet, R-Henrico, Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond, Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, Del. Debra D. Gardner, D-Chesterfield. A staff member of Del. Dolores McQuinn, D-Richmond, was also present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard tonight people would be directly affected by it and that&#8217;s just unacceptable,&#8221; said Willet alongside Cousins in an interview. &#8220;We passed the Clean Economy Act for a reason, to pursue those clean energy alternatives, and this is flying in the face of that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is proposed to be built in  a community consisting largely of minority and low-income residents, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental justice screening and mapping </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ejscreen" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tool.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I am a resident of the city of Richmond, but I&#8217;m here, and I will be here to help that fight. At some point they will not get those permits,&#8221; said Richard Walker Tuesday, while referencing past court decisions that have overturned air permits for other controversial energy projects, including one for an Atlantic Coast Pipeline </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/01/07/federal-court-overturns-union-hill-compressor-station-permit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compressor station</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Buckingham County. &#8220;We went to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals and that three judge panel told them, &#8216;You do not have sufficient evidence for us to agree to grant you this permit.’ That needs to happen here.&#8221;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40607" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/20241029_192319/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40607" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192319-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attendees at the Friends of Chesterfield People&#8217;s Hearing Tuesday night. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The critics have asked the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors to hold a public hearing to solicit community input for local approvals, a requirement for Dominion in order to receive its air permit from the Department of Environmental Quality and final certificate of public convenience and necessity from the State Corporation Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because a former coal plant site on Coxendale Road that is now the proposed location is already zoned for an electricity generation plant, Chesterfield officials have indicated to DEQ local requirements have been satisfied and no further public action is needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts to reach Chesterfield County officials were unsuccessful, but Tuesday night, county Supervisor Jessica Schneider sent a statement to the Friends of Chesterfield, saying she was &#8220;sorry I am in the minority and could not convince my fellow supervisors to do the right thing and hold a public hearing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I continue to stand with you in opposition to the gas plant, because not only does it go against the Virginia Clean Economy Act, but more importantly, it poses severe health risks to the Black and Brown and economically disadvantaged communities that are nearby and have been subjected to over 60 years of coal pollution and air pollution from the coal plant,” Schneider’s statement read. “It is a clear case of environmental injustice.&#8221; </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dominion’s response</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, in response to community concern, the utility switched the location of the proposal to its former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station where the existing infrastructure may be used to reduce construction costs. The utility signaled Tuesday that the planned plant will remain part of its future energy mix, which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more solar, wind, battery storage and nuclear sources than its previous plan, though the percentage of zero-carbon sources has decreased from 95% to 80% of the plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are all-in on renewables, building the largest offshore wind project in the U.S. and operating the nation&#8217;s second-largest solar fleet,&#8221; said Jeremy Slayton, a Dominion spokesperson. &#8220;Renewables alone cannot reliably keep our customers&#8217; power on around the clock. The Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center will allow us to continue to transition to renewables without ever sacrificing reliability.&#8221; </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40608" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/20241029_192616/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40608" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241029_192616-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map showing the impact of pollution from Dominion&#8217;s proposed natural gas plant. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a </span><a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Report_DominionsProposedCERCFacilityAEC23Jul2024-2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the Southern Environmental Law Center, created in partnership with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applied Economics Clinic and touted at Tuesday’s event</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, suggests that clean energy could do the trick, instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Not only would the 1,000 megawatt need be met with resources that do not add harmful air pollutants, these alternatives would cost less,” SELC staff attorney Rachel James told the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion previously said it expects DEQ to unveil a draft air permit by the end of the year. Critics of the plant say they&#8217;re preparing for Dominion to submit its application for a certificate of convenience and necessity to the State Corporation Commission early next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is still expected to come online in 2029, though an update to Dominion&#8217;s long term planning document, called the Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, shows 944 megawatts of electricity from natural gas first being produced in 2030. That represents the first full year of service, Slayton said. </span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story was updated to correct a transcription error on the size of Dominion&#8217;s solar fleet, and to note that Del. Candi Mundon King did not attend the People&#8217;s Hearing as previously reported. </em></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A coalition that represents solar developers in Virginia plans to ask the legislature to change how solar projects are approved at the local level, arguing that municipal bans are hurting efforts to meet the requirements of the state&#8217;s 2020 Clean Economy Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past 18 months, 33 large utility-scale solar projects — representing  3,236 megawatts of power — have been </span><a href="https://marec.us/news-va-siting-reform/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rejected</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">across the state, according to the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition, or MAREC, which represents 47 renewable energy developers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a big chunk of capacity in the short term,” said Evan Vaughan, executive director of MAREC Action, who called the current environment challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MAREC says 34 counties have restrictive ordinances and 16 have limitations that amount to a ban on utility-scale projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data offers a snapshot of the struggles solar developers have faced in recent years as Virginia’s clean energy goals and growing energy needs have met local resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are opposed to removing the authority of local government in siting,” said Jim Riddell, with the Virginia Cattleman’s Association. “We believe decisions are best made at the local level where the people live and work and farm, grow their food.”</span></p>
<p><b>Constructs of the Clean Economy Act</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020 and under trifecta control of the state government in Virginia, Democrats passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which seeks to decarbonize the state’s electric grid by mid-century. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law requires Virginia’s two largest utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, to transition to carbon-free electricity in part by owning 16,100 megawatts and 600 megawatts of solar electricity, respectively, by 2035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VCEA also requires Dominion and Appalachian Power to maintain renewable portfolio standards, which are met by buying renewable energy credits created when a solar panel generates electricity. The credits can come from utility-owned generation sources or third-party sources, and starting in 2025, have to come from Virginia-based solar facilities.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2035 target and need for Virginia-based RECs to maintain the renewal standards past that target, some solar projects have been approved. One of the latest examples is Chesapeake in </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2024/09/17/chesapeake-approves-41-acre-solar-project-farmers-say-it-will-provide-security/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, giving the OK for a 5-megawatt facility on 41 acres for a shared solar program, which lets residents subscribe to the electricity produced by a more centralized set of panels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But other projects have run into opposition from those trying to preserve the state’s remaining farmland. Virginia’s farmland has </span><a href="https://articles.vafb.com/decline-in-farmland-worrying-farmers-agricultural-organizations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 500,000 acres over the last five years. For instance, </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/community/orangenews/the-sun-has-set-on-solar-development-in-orange-county/article_8625ded8-664f-11ef-a390-6b9fff43d167.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently denied an 80-megawatt project proposed for 1,000 acres, the second project it had rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Farming] has been the history and legacy of this county,” said Orange County Supervisor Crystal Hale at the board’s Aug. 27 meeting, according to the Daily Progress. “If we start taking out 1,000 acres out at a time, we’re taking out that history and legacy for the few that think that their property rights are more important than the rest of this county.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, as of mid-October, the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia&#8217;s utilities, and the Department of Environmental Quality, which approves smaller solar projects, had approved 9,500 megawatts of solar, with 4,500 getting built, said Aaron Berryhill, solar program manager at the Virginia Energy department during a Virginia Clean Energy Summit panel recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD682/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">built so far</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dominion owns about 2,000 megawatts and gets 290 megawatts from third-party developers that sell the electricity to the utility through power purchase agreements, or PPAs, Berryhill told the Mercury. Appalachian Power owns a 5 megawatt facility and gets 55 megawatts through PPAs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot of really exciting progress that’s already occurred, a lot of lessons learned and a lot of really good examples out there that I think are a really good foundation for this conversation,” Berryhill said during the panel.</span></p>
<p><b>A changing landscape</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy officials have emphasized that they are ready to work with localities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not going to tell a locality what to do, that’s not our job…we have to work within those things,” Ed Baine, president of Dominion Energy Virginia, said in a media roundtable with reporters recently. “We don’t try to dictate what we believe should be in their ordinances county by county, but we absolutely engage and try to educate on what is reasonable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as the delays exist, energy demand is projected to more than double by 2048 in Dominion Energy territory, due to data center proliferation, and electrification of vehicles, and everyday life. That demand is prompting utilities to propose natural gas plants and small modular nuclear plans alongside renewable sources to provide electricity more reliability around the clock. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As those facilities take time to build, solar panels can be paired with battery storage devices that could provide dispatchable power on an instant&#8217;s notice similar to a natural gas plant, Vaughan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think we can be part of the solution,” he added.</span></p>
<p><b>Legislative proposals</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the most recent legislative session, MAREC lobbied for a bill that would give the State Corporation Commission authority to approve a solar project if a locality denied it. Another bill would have prevented a locality from banning solar projects so long as the total area of land under a solar panel remained under  4%. Both bills failed to advance over concerns of limiting local authority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The Virginia Association of Counties) supports preserving and maintaining current land use authority in making decisions at the local level with input from a county’s respective constituency,” said Joe Lerch, director of local government policy for VaCo. “We do not support state preemption of this authority.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, MAREC is considering a bill that would create a solar siting board pairing local officials with state-level officials more familiar with solar projects in order to understand more holistically the benefits of a project, ways to mitigate any negatives and still meet clean energy goals. There could also be the creation of a standard set of best practices to follow in order to calm localities concerns, and provide certainty for future developers to know what to expect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaughan said localities need to maintain input, “but there needs to be a balance again.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Farm Bureau, which has pushed back against solar development in the state in order to preserve farm and forested land, is opposed to taking away local authority. The Farm Bureau’s opposition includes the argument that farmers need to meet water quality standards, such as Chesapeake Bay cleanup goals, which benefit from tree canopy and forested buffers to collect pollutants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the full picture of the local concerns should be taken into consideration when discussing a statistic,” said Martha Moore, vice president of governmental relations for the Virginia Farm Bureau. “There are many reasons why a locality might turn down a project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riddell, with the Virginia Cattlemen&#8217;s Association, added concern stems from an instance in Essex County in 2018 when a solar developer was fined for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/04/18/youngkin-administration-sets-stricter-runoff-rules-for-solar-farms/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sediment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> control violations. Earlier this </span><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/business/solar-farm-developer-cited-for-western-virginia-environmental-violations/article_827cdf88-17b8-11ef-9c41-1322027bcd68.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, another solar developer was fined for similar reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We depend on solar energy for our grass and our food crops and to provide whole food to Virginia. Solar energy is important to us,” said Riddell. “There is major concern over the loss of ag and forestry land.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The topic is one of many to be discussed at a summit Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, is hosting </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/005ceb5f201/c06272f5-4fac-4747-8e77-8e1ed319f5e4.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nov. 18</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Richmond on ways to maintain the goals of the Virginia Clean Economy Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not touching the act</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Marsden, in a phone interview. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The act itself is fine. What are the circumstances around it that have changed in four years and how do we adjust to that demand?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After  giving Dominion Energy the green light to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/24/as-offshore-wind-installation-rises-dominion-showcases-environmental-economic-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">construct</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project in one WEA 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, and in August awarding the utility a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/14/dominion-wins-second-offshore-wind-lease-area-with-lone-bid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> WEA directly east of CVOW, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bureau of Ocean Energy Management</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is accepting comments ahead of drafting the new WEAs in what is called the Central Atlantic 2 Call Area, a span of about 13.4 million acres off the coasts of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40581" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1586px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/central-atlantic-2-call-area-map/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40581" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map.jpg" alt="" width="1586" height="1054" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map.jpg 1586w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map-300x199.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map-768x510.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Central-Atlantic-2-Call-Area-map-1536x1021.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1586px) 100vw, 1586px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Central Atlantic 2 Call Area map. (Courtesy of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with progressing toward the federal government Biden’s goals, Dominion’s two offshore wind sites, and a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/08/dominion-to-purchase-second-offshore-wind-lease-area-off-coast-of-north-carolina/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">third </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">site 36 miles off the coast of North Carolina the utility recently finalized acquisition of, are critical to the utility’s compliance with the Virginia Clean Economy Act. The 2020 law seeks to decarbonize the state’s electric grid, which is facing challenges amid </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> demand nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Shaun Gehan, counsel for Omega Protein, wrote in the company’s request that extending the 6-mile buffer currently proposed for any future WEAs off the coast of Virginia is “vitally important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only are the waters around the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay the area where most of the conflicts with the menhaden fishery would be most acute, it is also an economically vital shipping lane, important area of military operations and traffic, and a high traffic area for recreational vessels,” Gehan wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omega Protein, the lone menhaden reduction fishery in the Chesapeake Bay, is a staple in fishery management in Virginia, with lawmakers, regulators and recreational striped bass fishers clashing over how to oversee the company’s operations. Critics have said Omega has a negative impact on the fish, while the company has called for sound science to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/recreational-fishers-call-on-legislators-for-action-on-menhaden-management/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prove</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> those claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reedville-based company focuses their catches of the tiny-nutrient rich menhaden fish in the calmer waters of the Bay to reduce them to fishmeal and oil. The company says it catches 93,000 metric tons, or 70%, of its menhaden annually in an area extending along the coast from North Carolina to Long Island in New York within the </span><a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/eez.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exclusive Economic Zone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while a “majority of the harvest occurs in the waters off of Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company deploys two vessels about 40 feet long and 13 feet wide that will circle schools of menhaden with a 1,100-foot long purse seine net in between them to scoop the fish up, Gehan explained. The operation involves spotter planes flying as low as 500 feet above sea level, and the boats potentially floating within a 2-3 mile distance of their net sets across a 30 minute to 2 hour duration in order to make their catches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems amply apparent that a fifteen-mile buffer would still provide ample areas for wind energy development,” Gehan wrote.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37277" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/20230717_1051402/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37277" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20230717_1051402-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1756" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20230717_1051402-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20230717_1051402-300x206.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20230717_1051402-1024x702.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20230717_1051402-768x527.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20230717_1051402-1536x1054.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/20230717_1051402-2048x1405.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A boat with fishermen next to a Dominion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind turbine in July. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other fisheries have raised concerns over potential conflicts in the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/06/23/as-feds-eye-more-wind-leases-off-virginia-fishing-industries-fear-losses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">past</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, recreational fishers have touted the potential for new fishing opportunities around wind turbines that can simulate diverse coral reefs and attract different species. The Nature Conservancy is partnering with Dominion and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/18/scientists-to-study-how-offshore-wind-construction-off-virginia-beach-impacts-fish/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> any marine life benefits or harms to guide future offshore wind policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Assn is in favor of this 15 mile buffer if it means that Omega will be fishing more often in the EEZ rather than the waters of the Chesapeake Bay where there have been conflicts with recreational fishers and associated small businesses for many years,” Steve Atkinson, chairman of the VSSA, told the Virginia Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But compared to recreational fishers, the larger vessels of Omega Protein need more space to operate, explained company spokesperson Ben Landry said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Traditional, very well established (fishing grounds) are at stake here,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">explained “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not anti-wind energy or renewables.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulations guiding hunting, one of Virginia’s oldest traditions, will remain unchanged after the Board of Wildlife Resources voted 6-3 against two proposals to update the state’s right to retrieve law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The right to retrieve law lets deer and bear hunters go onto other people’s property to get their dogs, which hunters use to scare up game. The Supreme Court of Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/11/right-to-retrieve-legal-challenge-dismissed-as-state-considers-new-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upheld rulings pointing to right to retrieve as an exception to trespass criminal law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property owners, increasingly </span><a href="https://www.coopercenter.org/research/amid-slow-population-growth-virginias-demographic-landscape-being-transformed#:~:text=Yet%2C%20examining%20the%202023%20population,the%20highest%20share%20since%201975." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moving</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to rural areas, have argued the law allows their private land to be turned into public property for hunters. The hunters contend that they want to continue their tradition as they have for decades, lawfully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the tension, the Department of Wildlife Resources issued reports and convened workgroups over the past several years that presented seven </span><a href="https://dwr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/media/10242024-Board-Meeting-Materials-02.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the two the board rejected Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the rejected proposals would have required deer and bear hunters to put GPS collars on the hounds they use. The other rejected proposal would’ve required hunters to make “reasonable efforts” to not let their dogs roam onto other property once property owners notified them they weren’t welcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other five proposals included raising awareness about ways to avoid conflicts between the two groups, as well as pursuing funding for more conservation police officers to respond to issues. The other proposals were not regulatory and have already been acted upon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Board Member Jim Edmunds, a former legislator, attempted to have the GPS collar proposal advance, board members ultimately voted against it and the other regulatory change. DWR recommended the rejections, saying the group didn’t have the power to make such changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The right to retrieve is statutory. That’s why you see that discussed at the General Assembly, how trespass itself is statutory,” said DWR Executive Director Ryan Brown. “It’s not something that this board would have the authority to take up.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decisions came after several property rights advocates said the current law violates their constitutional rights, disturbs their peace and safety and compromises their ability to maintain their livestock. The advocates also said the expenses of putting barriers on their property to bar roaming dogs outweighed the costs of hunters using GPS collars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t care if others hunt with dogs, we don’t want to stop that. We want to stop the constant intrusions onto our properties,” said Property Rights Coalition of Virginia representative Jim Medeiros, who was one of the property owners who sued the state over the right to retrieve law, but lost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This board has been specifically and exclusively given the authority to regulate (hound hunting) by the General Assembly,” Medeiros added. “Like it or not, you own this problem.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40537" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/25/virginia-board-votes-to-reject-changes-to-hound-hunting-regulations/img_4599/" rel="attachment wp-att-40537"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40537" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4599-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4599-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4599-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4599-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4599-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4599-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4599-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Hunter Thrasher, president of the Virginia Bear Hunters Association, speaks to the Board of Wildlife Resources. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several hunters, donning blaze orange hunting caps, also spoke at the meeting, citing the cost of the collars as a barrier to young hunters participating and the seemingly low rate of trespass convictions resulting from conflict — 60 out 60,000 complaints that did not warrant changes (though property rights advocates called out difficulties in proving trespassing).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will stand up for our rights, also for our traditions, as Virginians,” said Kirby Burch, chief executive officer of the Virginia Hunting Dog Alliance, after saying the solution is to “show respect for one another.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will continue to hunt with hounds for another generation, if you will work with me to make those promises I just gave come to pass,” Burch said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has a process underway to solicit suggestions for next year’s deer and bear season regulations, but the rejection means the battle over the law could end up being fought in next year’s General Assembly session, which starts in January.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States Department of Transportation announced Friday that it’s sending </span><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-sends-virginia-10-million-emergency-relief-funding-roads" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$10 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Virginia Department of Transportation to “restore and reopen” a one-mile stretch of Route 58 in Washington County that was washed out when Hurricane Helene wreaked havoc in the Southwest Virginia region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hurricane Helene’s devastation affected communities in multiple states, including Virginia, and the Biden-Harris Administration is here to support all of them as they recover and rebuild,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, in a statement on the funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Route 58 spans the entire state all the way from Virginia Beach through Southside and into Tennessee, where it becomes State Route 383. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The washed-out portion runs between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the intersection of Route 91 at Damascus and Feather Camp Road in the Konnarock area</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has prompted a 30-mile detour until the road is reopened. The mountainous region has limited thoroughfares connecting the more populated regions, making Route 58 an important alternative to hilly, curvy backroads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Estimates of when the road will be functional were not included in the release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A total of 484 primary and secondary roads and 118 bridges were closed following the storm. Now, only two primary and 16 secondary roads, and 10 bridges, remained closed, Virginia Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings said in an update to legislators at a Senate Finance Committee last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement of the funding comes after Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Oct. 17 </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/october/name-1035403-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  the Office of Hurricane Helene Rebuilding and Recovery to track the state’s restoration efforts. The storm  is now credited with killing three Southwest Virginians, after one person who was injured in North Carolina during the weather event and died after returning to his home in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings also relayed in his update to legislators that  200 people in hard-to-reach areas were still without power and that nearly all schools had reopened by Oct. 7, with Grayson County Public Schools re-opening soon after.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Oct. 7, five disaster recovery centers have been opened in the state in Damascus, Independence, Tazewell, Dublin and Marion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Oct. 8, damage in the region had led the state to lose about $731.4 million in income tax, $8.9 billion in taxable sales, and 249,330 jobs, Cummings shared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement about the creation of the office, a Youngkin news release said the move “does not redirect the administration of resources from any agency, but formalizes the coordination and oversight of resources and activities out of the Governor’s office.” Cummings added the office could be made up of one or two people, and would free up the Virginia Department of Emergency Management to continue to respond to other events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know this is a long road, but with the incredible grit and resilience of the people and communities affected, in collaboration with local, state and federal partners, Southwest Virginia will rebuild stronger than ever,” Youngkin said in his statement.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Slaven runs a sheep farm in Augusta County, where her family has been across different operations for seven generations, now with her nieces pitching in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Slaven was grateful because of her “off farm job” to generate income after drought conditions, presenting back to back years of challenges ahead of this year’s harvest season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What if I lost my job?” said Slaven, who works with Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative. “The only reason I have this place right now is because I have an off-the-farm income.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Record drought hit Virginia this past summer, impacting profits in the largest economic sector in the state, even though programs are available at the federal level to offset losses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, agriculture contributes about $82.3 billion annually to the </span><a href="https://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/markets-and-finance-agriculture-facts-and-figures.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">economy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with more than 381,800 jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But temperatures reaching 99 degrees twice at the end of June in the Lynchburg area, with no rain and strong winds, pinched farmers’ pockets putting an emphasis on assistance programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a lot of claims,” said Danielle Bappert, regional crop agent for Virginia Farm Bureau Crop Insurance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Yeah, it’s definitely tough this year.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The drought </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality manages dry spells through the Drought Monitoring Task Force, a collection of other state agencies, which issued advisories that got put in place, expanded, lifted and put in place again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 24, the task force placed a warning, which indicated that “a significant drought is imminent,” impacting 12 counties, mainly in Northern Virginia and the Northern Shenandoah Valley. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a month later, the warning expanded to 60 counties.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40470" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:285px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40470" rel="attachment wp-att-40470"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40470 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/unnamed.gif" alt="" width="285" height="199" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map of drought advisories in Virginia. (Courtesy of Department of Environmental Quality)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conditions persisted until tropical Storm </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/akq/Aug082024_Debby" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debby</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hit the area in early August with about 7-10 inches over a few days. The task force then lifted 76 of the drought warnings, and watches, which is a less severe advisory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then in September, more severe warnings were issued  for the northern Shenandoah Valley. Following Hurricane Helene, which hit the region at the end of September, the task force moved the warnings to less severe watches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to what is being seen on a planetary level, these trends were hamstrung by dry conditions at the start, said Weeden Cloe, manager of the office of water supply at the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were hoping that there would be a very wet winter, with significant recharge for the groundwater, but it wasn’t really enough to bring groundwater levels to a point where they were able to be normal for this year,” said Cloe. “They were almost operating right off the bat in a deficit. This year, they dropped down very fast. In the Shenandoah Valley, they really haven’t popped back up until now.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dry conditions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drought this year hurt sheep farmers, and the corn and bean commodities Virginia is known for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaven, on her 68 acres, has about 55 ewes, or female sheep, for breeding that she fully rotates around her pastures every four to six weeks so they don’t nibble too far down on the grass where parasites are, and so the grass can recover.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40463" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40463" rel="attachment wp-att-40463"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40463 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4275-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Morgan Slaven&#8217;s farm in Augusta County. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Slaven managed her father’s cattle and split the profits, which are supposed to be about 60 cents per pound the gain. The rate is supposed to be 2 pounds every day, but hers only gained about 15 pounds over 90 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, she went into a partnership with another farmer to take 40% of a hay crop to ensure feeding.  But she skipped the first, early season harvesting with hopes to take the second and third cuts. The drought caused those to never come, and she had to spend between $150 and $200 a week on feed at the store to make up for food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It feels like why am I doing this, because the mortgage payment is still the same,” Slaven said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effects of the dry spells can be felt with commodities, according to the United States Department of Agriculture National Ag Statistics, which said in </span><a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Virginia/Publications/Current_News_Release/2024/OctCrop24_VA.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">October</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that corn yields were estimated to be 36.1 million bushels, down 38% from the 2023 level. Soybeans are forecast to be up 22% from last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas beans “idle” throughout the season, Robert Harper, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">grain marketing specialist at the Virginia Farm Bureau,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said that corn is “like a running back in the NFL, it’s explosive, it&#8217;s strong, and quick and fast.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40468" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40468" rel="attachment wp-att-40468"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40468" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4334-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A corn field in Augusta County. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June, the lack of moisture and the warm night time temperatures not getting below 85 degrees meant the corn never pollinated or “silked” to produce its ear.  When the rain came in July, the crop had already missed its chance to grow an ear, Harper said. Downpours came that did some damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a half a crop at best, and it’s highly damaged,” said Harper. “It’s a year of extremes. It seems like we’re just getting these cyclical weather patterns, and we get stuck in them.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Programs for help</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistance is there for the taking, but some may be reluctant to use it, and it may only allow farmers to break even.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to get help, the USDA issued </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a primary natural disaster designation for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 </span><a href="https://www.vdacs.virginia.gov/press-releases-240730-localities-eligible-usda-emergency-loans.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">counties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows for emergency loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaven tapped into disaster assistance, because she was paying the expenses out of pocket for feed instead of relying on naturally growing grass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People have a lot of pride, they don’t want to take donations, but it’s there, because your tax dollars are paying for it,” Slaven said. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40467" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=40467" rel="attachment wp-att-40467"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40467 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_4323-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Bales of hay in Augusta County. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also farmers insurance, which is similar to a health policy by having farmers pay into it then get compensated by the government, Bappert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A “vast majority,” of clients will be filing a claim this year, Bappert said, adding that insurance and meeting environmental standards is a prerequisite to become eligible for Emergency Relief Program payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, a farmer who faced similar feed shortages for his livestock, which forced him to buy 100 bales at $50 a piece in July, said the insurance can help producers break even.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you do that correctly, you don’t lose money,” Webert said. “You don’t make money, but you don’t lose money.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of Dominion Energy)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy&#8217;s 1.6 MW Black Bear Solar project in Buckingham County is now partnered with Mountain House Apiaries, using Italian honey bees to maintain the land around the solar arrays while benefiting the local agricultural community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project falls under the category of agrivoltaics — another way to label pairing solar panels with agricultural uses — and is an effort by Dominion to show and see how solar can live in harmony with the land and surrounding agriculture industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people are very, very passionate about making sure the area stays agricultural,” said Adam Fillius, electrical distribution program manager at Dominion Energy, while out on a tour of the facility. “If you can provide them with clean energy and still be able to stay agricultural. That&#8217;s a win for everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The honey bee, which almost became the state’s official pollinator species by way of legislation earlier this year, is lost at a 35% rate each year, but has spiked up to a 48% loss in one year.  Honey bees are needed for about one-third of all food </span><a href="https://honeybee.sweetvirginia.org/#:~:text=But%20honey%20bees%20are%20declining,%2C%20cold%20winters%2C%20and%20pesticides.&amp;text=Virginian%20beekeepers%20and%20farmers%20suffer%20from%20low%20honey%20bee%20populations%20too." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">production</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s plenty of feral bees out there, ones that live in the tree,” said Chuck Burden, beekeeper at Mountain House Apiaries. “The honey bees are endangered.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Interconnecting with honey</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $7.5 million solar project, which can produce enough electricity to power 400 homes, came online in 2023 after the State Corporation Commission approved it as one of the first projects proposed under the VCEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through a mutual contact, Fillius got connected with Burden, who reviewed some online </span><a href="https://va.beecheck.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if there were other bee farms within a five-mile radius, since bees travel within this range, that might create competition for food. He also checked to see what farms are in the area that might use herbicides, pesticides or insecticides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buckingham County, located in the middle of the state, has 375 farms totaling about 80,900 acres with an average of about 216 acres per operation, according to the United States Department of </span><a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2022/Online_Resources/County_Profiles/Virginia/cp51029.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agriculture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but Burden said he didn’t find any conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Part of my thinking is the solar farms don’t do herbicide spraying or insecticide spraying, so the earth that they&#8217;re sitting on, regardless of what it was used for prior to, is allowed to heal and get back to its natural state,” he said. Burden also saw added appeal from the security fence and trees surrounding the facility to protect the bees from bears.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has a requirement to have a percentage of their seed mix be pollinator friendly, which helps the bees, Burden said. That resulted in a traditional turf mix planted under the panels surrounded by native pollinator plants: white clover, little bluestem, black-eyed susan, eastern columbine, lance leaf coreopsis and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Keeping all the clover and the other pollinators that we have mixed in with this grass that’s growing here, it’s a big benefit,” said Steve Voreh, c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ompliance program manager in the renewable energy department </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with Dominion. “You can see here there’s almost no erosion at all, just a nice big green field with clover and other pollinators.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Busy bees</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since August, the about 14-acre site Dominion Energy leases &#8211; has been home to about 45,000 bees in each of the about four hives made with wood and nailed together at the corner joints, for a total of about 180,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burden bears the costs of the bees, with room to add another four hives and possibly up to 24 across the whole site. He’ll check on them by testing the pollen for chemicals and weighing them to make sure they get enough food. He’ll harvest about 20 pounds of honey, with about 60 to 80 pounds left so the bees can make it through the winter. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40447" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/18/dominion-energy-pairs-solar-with-honey-bees-to-preserve-agricultural-land/9-19-24_blu06439/" rel="attachment wp-att-40447"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40447 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/9-19-24_BLU06439-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/9-19-24_BLU06439-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/9-19-24_BLU06439-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/9-19-24_BLU06439-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/9-19-24_BLU06439-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/9-19-24_BLU06439-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/9-19-24_BLU06439-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Italian Honey Bees at Dominion Energy&#8217;s Black Bear Solar project in Buckingham County. (Courtesy of Dominion Energy)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hives join the roughly 200 that Burden has at 10 locations across the state to sell product at his shop on State Route 151 in Nelson County, turn it into mead or let his daughter consume it to avoid her needing daily allergy shots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is probably the allergy capital of the world,” Burden said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The goal</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tension between solar developers and the farming community is centered around the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law that seeks to transition Dominion to renewable generation sources that don’t emit climate changing emissions by 2045. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers want to build, but farmers are concerned about land loss and disturbances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of honey bees is an extension of other agrivoltaics efforts that use sheep to rotationally graze about 40 acres of land every few days, and potentially planting crops on the middle of panels after more research is done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dominion is very focused on looking at agrivoltaics right now with its solar farms,” said Tim Eberly, a Dominion spokesperson. “We’re exploring other sites where we could put bee hives.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40449" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/18/dominion-energy-pairs-solar-with-honey-bees-to-preserve-agricultural-land/20241002_120752/" rel="attachment wp-att-40449"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40449 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241002_120752-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Adam Fillius, electrical distribution program manager at Dominion Energy, stands next to the Italian honey bees and solar panels at the Black Bear Solar facility in Buckingham County. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martha Moore, senior vice president of governmental relations with the Virginia Farm Bureau who has pushed for legislation to preserve farmland, said the concept of agrivoltaics is “interesting,” but the jury is still out as Virginia Tech conducts </span><a href="https://ralphphall.com/tag/agrivoltaics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the viability of the concept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re certainly open to the discussion,” said Moore, while also wanting some more details:  “What does that entail? How is it economically viable for farmers?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for Burden, the project with Dominion is a “very promising” part of the transition to a natural environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The other thing that&#8217;s promising is, what better opportunity do you have to be right in the middle of all the farmers to help educate them to strike a balance?” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its second headquarters in Arlington, Amazon also announced an agreement with Energy Northwest to invest in building a small modular reactor in the state of Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a ton that we need to do between here and there, and there&#8217;s a lot of work that needs to go into this, but this is a really important milestone that we&#8217;re celebrating today,” Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services, said at the announcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small modular reactor, or SMR, is a newer, smaller form of nuclear technology that doesn’t emit carbon that fuels climate change. Part of SMR’s appeal is that parts can be manufactured off site and put together on site with smaller footprints, but isn’t yet commercially viable outside of Russia and China. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcements show a commitment by one of the worlds’ largest tech companies to produce a zero-carbon emitting energy source instead of relying on  natural gas to supply power for data centers, the energy intensive warehouses that store computers’ processing equipment, internet network servers and data drives.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 70% of the world’s data centers are concentrated in Northern Virginia. Amazon Web Services has some in </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/amazon-acquires-three-data-centers-in-sterling-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is home to an area dubbed Data Center Alley. </span><a href="https://www.vedp.org/industry/data-centers" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as a whole is home to about 150 hyperscale data centers, those that can support artificial intelligence and have increased computing and energy needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers have sparked public </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about land clearing, water usage and noise, but also the opportunity to pad local and state coffers with tax revenue. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/15/data-center-gas-emissions-tech" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have also been reported to be increasing emissions worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMRs could change that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal was by 2040 to get to a carbon-zero world,” Garman said. “We didn&#8217;t know how to do it. We didn&#8217;t necessarily know the path to get there. We knew it was important, and an important goal for us to set. Today is an enormous milestone along that path.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re very happy to partner with AWS,” said Ed Baine, president of Dominion Energy Virginia, adding, the agreement in the form of an MOU is “a way to help mitigate risks for customers while still advancing the technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMRs can produce about 300 megawatts of electricity, enough to </span><a href="https://www.gevernova.com/content/dam/gepower-nuclear/global/en_US/documents/product-fact-sheets/SMR%20BWRX300%20Infographic.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">power</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 300,000 homes, compared to a traditional reactor that produces about 1,000 megawatts, or 1 gigawatt. In its latest long term planning </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dominion expects to connect a total of 16 new data center campuses, totalling an energy need of about 1 gigawatt by the end of 2024, and those projections are expected to </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24052024/virginia-data-center-market-electricity-demand/#:~:text=Even%20with%20those%20commitments%2C%20the,Web%20Services%2C%20which%20Virginia%20Gov." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon’s announcement comes after Dominion Energy unveiled over the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/11/dominion-seeking-small-nuclear-reactor-proposals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a request for proposals to design and determine the feasibility of an SMR at the North Anna Power Station. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s too early to say if that RFP would culminate in the Amazon-funded SMR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal, state and local officials were on hand for the Amazon announcement, including U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, U.S. Democratic Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For The Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, on Tuesday filed an <a class="c-link" href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/-/media/pdfs/global/company/IRP/2024-IRP-w_o-Appendices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.dominionenergy.com/-/media/pdfs/global/company/IRP/2024-IRP-w_o-Appendices.pdf" data-sk="tooltip_parent">update</a> to its long-term electricity generation plan showing the majority of energy it expects to produce will come from renewable sources.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s revamped, non-binding Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) looks 15 years into the future to detail how power will be provided and calls for an “all-of-the-above” approach that includes more reliance on natural gas. The utility’s previous plan projection said about 95% of electricity generation would be pulled from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/12/dominion-regulator-recommends-rejection-of-utilitys-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renewable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sources. Tuesday’s updated plan calls for  about 80% of generation to be spurred by renewables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are experiencing the largest growth in power demand since the years following World War II,&#8221; said Ed Baine, president of Dominion Energy Virginia. &#8220;No single energy source, grid solution or energy efficiency program will reliably serve the growing needs of our customers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although subject to change as technology and demands evolve, the IRP is a glimpse into Dominion’s generation project proposals, which are paid for by ratepayers. This year’s update is a fine-tune adjustment to the plan unveiled </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/03/dominion-projects-new-gas-plants-advanced-nuclear-will-be-needed-to-meet-soaring-demand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">year, which is when the public learned that the utility was reviving plans for natural gas plants, one of which was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/27/dominion-still-facing-opposition-to-natural-gas-plant-proposal-after-location-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Chesterfield County to meet growing energy needs, heightened by Dominion’s concern over renewable energy’s ability to produce enough power.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ueCn7uFQtW"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/27/dominion-still-facing-opposition-to-natural-gas-plant-proposal-after-location-change/">Dominion still facing opposition to natural gas plant proposal after location change</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Dominion still facing opposition to natural gas plant proposal after location change&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/27/dominion-still-facing-opposition-to-natural-gas-plant-proposal-after-location-change/embed/#?secret=wTwIxdp45n#?secret=ueCn7uFQtW" data-secret="ueCn7uFQtW" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental and ratepayer groups decried last year’s plan and said it would contribute to the emission of greenhouse gasses that scientists say are exacerbating climate changes’ increasing storm intensity and frequencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics also said the utility’s IRP conflicted with the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which passed in 2020 with the goal of decarbonizing Dominion’s grid by 2045 by transitioning to renewable generation sources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law allows for a carbon-emitting, fossil fuel facility to remain online past 2045 if  grid reliability or the ability to provide enough power would be risked without it. Detractors countered by saying those risks are not a guaranteed reality and the plan would leave ratepayers on the hook for a polluting facility that will need to be shut down in years to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dominion’s latest energy plan blatantly disregards the financial well-being and health of Virginia families,” said Kate Asquith, deputy director of energy and operations at Clean Virginia, a group founded by millionaire Michael Bills to counter Dominion’s influence in the state legislature. “By continuing to invest in gas-burning facilities, Dominion is not just raising bills—it&#8217;s locking Virginians into a future of higher costs and greater pollution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IRP update this year considers four different plans based on different regulation requirements. The most realistic plan, which incorporates rules under the VCEA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could increase a current monthly bill of $142.77 to $214.24 by the end of 2039 for a typical residential customer using 1,000 kilowatts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased grid demand is the key driver of the updated forecast, with 5.5% annually now expected, compared to the 5.1% annual use projection Dominion relied on last year.  The new forecast also projects about 45 gigawatts of electricity that will be needed for use during the summer in 2039, an additional 6 gigawatts of power compared to what was expected last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility is also pushing to own more generation sources to avoid purchasing power during peak demand moments in the summer and winter when cooling and heating units are cranking and the electricity cost </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/07/costs-for-electricity-during-extreme-weather-rising-dominion-says-nothing-to-worry-about-yet/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">skyrockets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Dominion’s plan also related an increased concern over the ability for solar, wind and battery storage sources to produce as much power as possible during cloudier, darker and colder months, known as an effective load carrying capability, or ELCC.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zQbPASQFXC"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/07/costs-for-electricity-during-extreme-weather-rising-dominion-says-nothing-to-worry-about-yet/">Costs for electricity during extreme weather rising; Dominion says nothing to worry about — yet</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Costs for electricity during extreme weather rising; Dominion says nothing to worry about — yet&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/07/costs-for-electricity-during-extreme-weather-rising-dominion-says-nothing-to-worry-about-yet/embed/#?secret=rlc78LwMyl#?secret=zQbPASQFXC" data-secret="zQbPASQFXC" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Data Center Coalition, a group advocating on behalf of the data center industry that is proliferating in Northern Virginia, has said they are committed to addressing the concern over renewables, even as fossil fuel generation sources that have been providing baseload power begin retiring under new state policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The data center industry is leaning in as a collaborative partner with utilities, grid operators, policymakers, regulators, and other stakeholders at this transformative moment to advance and accelerate grid modernization and energy infrastructure to support Virginia&#8217;s — and the nation’s — economic growth and competitiveness,” said Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost 6 gigawatts, up from about 3 gigawatts, of new natural gas fired generation is included in the plan, the equivalent of five more of the 1 gigawatt plants Dominion has proposed in Chesterfield. Tuesday’s IRP didn’t suggest locations for new facilities beyond the use of brownfield sites, which are already-disturbed lands that require remediation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan also explores adding combined cycle steam turbines to the generation mix, which could create electricity from the gas turbines to reduce emissions while also operating “more often to serve customers’ everyday loads.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuclear is another part of the proposed generation plan, with the development of five small modular reactors slated to start in 2035. The update mentioned SMR development advancements as examples of the technology&#8217;s progression, including the design approval of NuScale Power, which was canceled amid ballooning costs, and the approval of </span><a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Wyoming-TerraPower-groundbreaking" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TerraPower’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> construction permit in May. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renewable generation sources included in the plan include: about 3.4 gigawatts of offshore wind the utility is pursuing; about 12 gigawatts of solar; and 4.5 gigawatts of battery storage. Along with the IRP update, Dominion also filed an application for about 1 gigawatts worth of solar projects that the State Corporation Commission will review. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The updated IRP discussed  how energy efficiency can reduce Virginia’s energy needs by 314 megawatts in the summer in 2024 and 553 megawatts by 2029.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is also considering blending hydrogen with natural gas to further reduce emissions, and is performing a company analysis of environmental justice communities in Virginia. So far, it found that 78% of the total geographical area and 89% of the population qualify as EJ communities under the Virginia Environmental Justice Act that passed in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With such a large proportion of the Commonwealth defined through the VEJA…as an EJ Community, avoidance is not possible,” the utility wrote.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Virginia residents’ legal challenge to state code tied to one of Virginia’s oldest traditions, the &#8220;right to retrieve&#8221; hunting law, has been dismissed, as, just ahead of deer hunting season, state officials will soon consider changes to the measure that allows hunters to go onto private property to get their dogs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Medeiros, of Dinwiddie County, and Mauricio Tover and Robert Pierce, who own property through Blue Wing LLC, of Halifax County, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/04/14/lawsuit-challenges-virginia-right-to-retrieve-law-for-hunting-dogs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources in April 2022 in Henrico County Circuit Court over a challenge to the law, stating that it amounted to the government turning their private property into a public use, which is known as a “taking.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking requires that the government compensate the property owners under the </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/b-139543-o.m.#:~:text=The%20Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the,made%20of%20the%20amount%20due." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifth Amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Just Compensation Clause and </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article1/section11/#:~:text=No%20private%20property%20shall%20be,achieve%20the%20stated%20public%20use." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Article I, § 11</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Virginia Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An appeals court rejected a challenge to the lower court&#8217;s decision. The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed that decision in September. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is the ‘right to retrieve’ law?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s right to retrieve law was created in 1936 to allow fox and raccoon hunters to go onto other people&#8217;s property without permission in order to retrieve their hunting dogs. Now, deer and bear hunters use the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hunters will let the dogs run around property they’re allowed to be on to scare up animals to harvest. But, sometimes, the hunted animals will run onto another property and the dogs will chase them there too, meaning the hunters will need to go retrieve them if they don’t return, even without the property owner’s permission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue of roaming hunting dogs has escalated largely in the eastern and Middle Peninsula regions in the state. Three hunting dogs were </span><a href="https://6rdh5iebb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001Daf1qJAQfWpHi-2MeqYurIMLZ-Q1W_QrW5eti1Ne7D1fZ1pIWU1d1E3Ud0NeU5QSTxQD1b0k2ASHjLQKGXYYp2yh4WSAL9oDOEECaqckLb71UuY8LqQEFKKbBTr_LgFNGQxOs3rnh9Rpa5KxOofQ0GUQ0kTh_82sT110MUpZqXNvFadpuRL4GSERVqccvXg8kfOm04ifk9P9g8DC9WjpHTMUu1q7J_2lABqtYs8WuwDd2aVF2aDWTVmuLa0-505oDg6AgD7ulUW8iqeMFGuLWMvJKCZPs9aQz5sAnVH6svXEQynQivycDg==&amp;c=L-noH9Tmpgzwx2NtXZHA0oU0uzvwzS05uRJ3rZgNi9dYJwZDjhMpow==&amp;ch=HshoJDPV4W8xM4zeej1cbxgAqRI-gtHQ5DFCnMEw4XNjXZ5-jqExTw==" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in King and Queen County in January, and a hunting dog was killed by a Caroline County couple in 2019. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hound hunters’ style is in contrast to still hunters, who sit in tree stands, quietly waiting for deer to cross their path before taking them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using dogs for hunting is now  part of the hunting industry that is estimated to contribute over $877 million annually to the state’s economy, but it dates back to the early colonial period, with hunters mounted on horses following foxes and raccoons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“George Washington and Thomas Jefferson were both avid foxhunters,” wrote Virginia Assistant Solicitor General Jordan Minot, who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Medeiros-Appellee-Brief_AG.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argued </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">against the challenge on behalf of DWR. “George Washington also had a specialized breed of raccoon dogs, gifts from the Marquis de Lafayette.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What was the basis of the lawsuit?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Medeiros, one of the appellants, said hunting dogs roaming onto his property caused a nuisance and loss of “time, money and even animals,” as the dogs “ripped” his free-range hens to pieces. Tover, similarly, said the dogs could spook horses being ridden at his stable, throwing and trampling riders. Pierce said his property is rented out to hikers, who could get caught in crossfire from the hunters. They said those risks justified compensation from the state.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney for the appellants, Daniel Woislaw, of the Pacific Legal Foundation, argued in Henrico County, the appeals court and the Supreme Court of Virginia that the law clearly states its intent is to grant “access to private properties for the public use of hunting with dogs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woislaw arguments relied on a case he previously argued and won in 2021, Cedar Point Nursery v. Hassid, which found that a California regulation allowing union organizers&#8217; access to private property constituted a taking, requiring compensation to property owners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Minot, for the state, argued that nothing in the law prohibits land owners from building fences or barriers to prevent dogs and hunters from entering their property during hunts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also under the law, there’s an ability for civil remedies, such as property owners suing for damages to land or livestock, and prohibitions on hunters carrying weapons while retrieving their dogs. Hunters must also identify themselves or face a penalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law is meant to create an exception under trespass penalties, Minot argued, adding, “the statute ‘takes’ no property rights from them.&#8221;   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woislaw argued that the law is not written in the same way other legal exceptions for criminal penalties are, but the Henrico County Circuit Court dismissed the case, citing that the law was only that, “an exception to criminal trespass,” and the “plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July 2023, the court of appeals decided not to take up a challenge over the lower court&#8217;s decision because there wasn’t a transcript of the oral arguments in the case. Without testimony or new evidence, attorneys agreed to not request a court recorder during the oral argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woislaw argued to the Supreme Court in </span><a href="https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2024.04.03-Medeiros-v-DWR-PLF-Opening-Brief.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">February</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that a transcript wasn’t necessary, and the circuit court’s order was “a complete and sufficient record for review.” But the Supreme Court of Virginia wrote in its Sept. 26 </span><a href="https://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/scv/orders_unpublished/230691.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the Court is of the opinion that there is no reversible error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals,” ending the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woislaw, in a statement to the Mercury, said he was “disappointed” in the supreme court ruling but that the issue likely isn’t over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jim Medeiros and other property owners across the Commonwealth whose lands have been flooded by hunters and hounds each hunting season deserve a firmer and more broad-reaching precedent,” Woislaw said. “Virginia&#8217;s rural property owners are not ones to sit on their rights and it is very likely this question will be back before Virginia&#8217;s highest court before long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, in a statement about the Supreme Court of Virginia’s decision, stated the law has existed “without incident,” for over 100 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia hunters treat their dogs as family, and there are fewer traditions more prized by rural Virginians than our hunting dogs,” Miyars said. “More than half of hunters in Virginia use hunting dogs, and fewer than 60 out of 6,000 hunting complaints involved trespass violations involving hunting dogs.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New regulations?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court ruling comes as the Board of Wildlife Resources is considering changes to the right to retrieve regulations at its meeting on Oct. 24. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following failed legislative attempts to change the law, months of work by a stakeholder advisory </span><a href="https://dwr.virginia.gov/hunters-landowners-sac/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led to two recommendations  made earlier this year. One would require hound hunters to use global positioning system </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewStage.cfm?stageid=10290" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">collars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on their dogs to better track where they are. The other would require hound hunters to make “</span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewStage.cfm?stageid=10291" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reasonable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” attempts to prevent dogs from entering a property after “after receiving notification that the hunter&#8217;s hunting dogs are not desired on the landowner’s property.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38211" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_1527/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38211" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1527-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1527-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1527-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1527-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1527-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1527-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_1527-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attendees at a Board of Wildlife Resources meeting March 20. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a meeting in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/26/board-of-wildlife-resources-considering-changes-to-right-to-retrieve-laws/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, property owners generally supported the measures as a way to control roaming dogs, but they also had concerns over a potential increase in conflicts from notifying hunters that their dogs aren’t welcome. The hunters saw the proposals as barriers to the tradition they’ve long loved and said the collars could be cost-prohibitive. One audience member had to be escorted out after a heated exchange with Board of Wildlife Resource member Woody Woodall.</span></p>

<p>The board ultimately voted to move forward with the recommendations, which have received 3,471 comments through the DWR website, mail, email and Town Hall website, the latter of which getting about 300 <a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/comments.cfm?stageid=10290" target="_blank">comments </a>on the GPS collars recommendation, mostly in opposition, and 1,220 comments on the <a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/comments.cfm?stageid=10291" target="_blank">notification</a> requirements, also mostly in opposition.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Board will consider these proposals at its October meeting on 10/24” said Shelby Crouch, a spokesperson for DWR, the state agency that oversees Virginia&#8217;s hunting regulations. “The exact effective date on any new regulation approved by the Board is at the Board’s discretion and in accordance with state code.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deer hunting season runs from November into early January.</span></p>

(Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the tried and true Old Farmer’s </span><a href="https://www.almanac.com/winter-extended-forecast-farmers-almanac" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almanac</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is calling for warmer temps and less snow this winter season, cold weather is on the way. The state and utilities throughout it are now accepting applications to help pay for residents’ heating bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Social Services offers the energy assistance </span><a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/benefit/ea/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes fuel assistance to offset heating bills from several utilities including Dominion Energy, Appalachian Power Company, Virginia Natural Gas and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department also offers crisis assistance, which can cover equipment upgrade costs as well as heating bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications for fuel assistance are being accepted until the second Friday in November, the 15th. The application window for crisis assistance equipment upgrades is Nov. 1 through March 15. Virginians can apply for crisis assistance to pay for bills between the “first workday in January through March 15.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be eligible for assistance, residents’ income must not exceed 150% of the federal poverty </span><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">level</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which for a family of four is $31,200. To determine eligibility and submit applications, residents can visit the state’s website, </span><a href="https://commonhelp.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CommonHelp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and visit local department of social service </span><a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/localagency/index.cgi" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/05/application-windows-for-heating-and-cooling-assistance-could-expand-under-virginia-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this past session from Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, allowed VDSS to expand the application window, since customers in need may not know and ask for it until the middle of the winter season. But, the bill was contingent on additional funding, which hasn’t been provided yet, meaning the application period may actually not be expanded until 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people can’t </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/12/utility-benefit-assistance-program-isnt-reaching-enough-virginians-state-report-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">afford</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pay all of their bills,” said Dana Wiggins, director of consumer advocacy at the Virginia Poverty Law Center, adding residents should still apply now for the energy assistance program in case they need help. “They’re making really hard choices.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More directly associated with utilities, Dominion Energy offers the EnergyShare </span><a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/billing/billing-options/energyshare" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, historically funded at $13 million by shareholders. Recipients can get $600 in assistance without income restrictions and the application period is Oct. 1 and May 31. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility, and Appalachian Power Company, also have a </span><a href="https://dss.virginia.gov/benefit/PIPP/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percentage of Income Payment Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which caps monthly electric heating bills to 10% of the monthly income of a customer making less than 150% of the federal poverty level. After 12 consecutive months of on-time payments, any balances are eliminated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Natural Gas, which serves customers in the Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula and the Norfolk region, also has an EnergyShare </span><a href="https://www.virginianaturalgas.com/residential/billing-and-payment-options/energy-assistance-programs.html#:~:text=web%20de%20ClearPoint.-,Virginia%20Natural%20Gas%20EnergyShare%20Program,customers%2C%20including%20seniors%20and%20veterans." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Salvation Army.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We recognize that colder temperatures lead to increased energy consumption, which can strain household budgets,&#8221; said Shannon Pierce, President of Virginia Natural Gas, in a statement. &#8220;VNG is dedicated to informing our customers about the resources available to them during the winter heating season.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another practice to lower bills is through increasing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/12/national-group-finds-low-income-residents-in-richmond-are-severely-energy-burdened/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy efficiency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the idea of weatherizing, or sealing up and insulating homes, as well upgrading equipment to use less energy, said Chelsea Harnish, executive director of the Virginia Energy Efficiency Council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LIHEAP funding for </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/wx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weatherization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is available through the Department of Housing and Community Development. Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, which provides the power for electric cooperatives, also offers energy assistance to those customers, Harnish said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can give a man a fish or teach a man how to fish,” said Harnish. “The point is, with heating assistance you’re not really solving the problem, whereas if you&#8217;re providing weatherization assistance and making their home energy efficient, that will help reduce their energy and they will not continue to rely on assistance.”</span></p>

(Photos courtesy of candidates' campaigns)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The election in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District is shaping up to be a tight contest, with two political newcomers vying for the support of swayable voters in one of the state’s most competitive districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Eugene Vindman is taking on Republican Derrick Anderson in a race to succeed U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, who announced last year that she is not seeking reelection in favor of a 2025 gubernatorial bid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district, anchored in Prince William County and stretching west to Madison County and south to Caroline County, has a history of narrow victories in past elections. With this being Vindman’s inaugural run for office and Anderson’s second foray into the 7th District race, both are working hard to connect with undecided voters who may swing the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to their shared ambition to represent the district in the U.S. Congress, both candidates bring a strong record of military service to the table — a key theme in their respective campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and attorney, has emphasized his commitment to defending democracy and advocating for national security. Anderson, also a veteran, served as a Green Beret in the Army Special Forces and has focused his campaign on conservative values, including strengthening national defense and supporting law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was a troop leader paratrooper in the 82nd, and when we jumped out of airplanes, it didn&#8217;t matter who was to the left or right of us, who was Democrat, Republican or independent, or whether you’re Black, Hispanic, what part of the country you came from,” Vindman told The Mercury in a recent interview. “We’re focused on the mission, and that’s my mindset in everything that I do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson did not respond to repeated interview requests for this article. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican has aligned himself with former President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again agenda and has expressed his support for at least some proposals in the conservative policy roadmap known as Project 2025, which outlines plans to reshape government and policy under a future Republican administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy policy has also emerged as a significant point of debate between the two candidates, with each offering contrasting visions for the future of Virginia’s energy sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, both have taken clear stances on abortion and immigration. Vindman has emphasized the need to protect reproductive rights and seek comprehensive immigration reform, while Anderson has focused on more restrictive immigration policies and has voiced support for overturning federal protections for abortion.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Candidates’ backgrounds </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman’s family immigrated to the United States from Ukraine in 1979 when he was 3. He joined the Army’s 82nd Airborne division as a paratrooper before rising to lieutenant colonel and Judge Advocate General,,the highest-ranking uniformed lawyer in the military. He later joined the White House’s National Security Team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman’s twin brother, Alex Vindman, became nationally known as a whistleblower who leaked details about a phone conversation betweenTrump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine during his presidency, which led to Trump’s impeachment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman was </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/07/politics/alex-vindman-donald-trump-impeachment/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fired</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Trump in 2020. He was investigating war crimes in Ukraine when Spanberger announced her gubernatorial bid last year. Vindman dominated the Democratic nomination contest, garnering more than 50% of the vote in a seven-way </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/18/subramanyam-vindman-win-democratic-primaries-to-succeed-wexton-spanberger/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought to myself, I really care about which direction this country is going in,” Vindman explained as his primary reason for running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, who traces his beginnings to working at his mother’s restaurant, served in the Middle East in Afghanistan, Bahrain, Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to work at the White House’s Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Trump administration and became a lawyer, before witnessing the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which he said was “botched.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was upset with the lack of accountability for this administration,” Anderson said during an Oct. 2 candidates </span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538743-1/virginia-7th-congressional-district-debate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Vindman at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">District profile</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger has represented the 7th District since 2019, after ousting U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, D-Henrico, by 50.3%-48.4%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent Cook Report </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/house-overview/house-rating-changes-close-races-nj-07-and-va-07-shift-toward" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has moved the district from “lean Democrat” to “toss up.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By June, Vindman had raised $7.4 million — over five times as much as Anderson, who raised $1.4 million. The Democratic National Committee recently backed Vindman’s effort with another $50,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The national support for candidates in the 7th District underscores the race’s significance in the broader political landscape. With Republicans holding a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives — 220 to 211 over Democrats — the outcome of this race could have far-reaching implications. Control of Congress will be pivotal in advancing or obstructing the agenda of the next president, whether it’s Trump or Harris.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The economy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A September Pew Research </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that the economy is the top issue on voters&#8217; minds this election season, and both candidates offer contrasting approaches to addressing economic concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has expressed worries about Trump’s policies and the potential impact of Project 2025 on the district’s workforce, which includes nearly </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47716" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60,000 federal employees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In contrast, Anderson has focused his campaign on energy policy, emphasizing the need for a strong energy sector to bolster the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s own policy plan, Agenda 47, would remove about 100,000 of those jobs. George Mason University professor Terry Clower </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/trump-government-cuts-could-cost-house-republicans-majority-.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the eliminated positions would equal a $27-28 billion loss from Virginia’s economy annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, like Trump, publicly denies supporting Project 2025, which calls for major overhauls of the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Folks, I did not know what Project 2025 was until this individual kept talking about it over and over again. But I can tell you that it’s not my plan,” Anderson </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtWw7ZqEkTI" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a recent candidate’s forum at a Manassas middle school, referring to his opponent   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has said he opposes Project 2025 because he doesn’t want to see it replace about 50,0000 “Schedule F” non-partisan federal employees with loyalists to whichever political party is in power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eliminating those jobs would literally devastate the economy in this area. It’s profoundly unfair, and it’s also damaging to national security,” Vindman said. “These are people that have spent decades in government, understanding threats, understanding Russia, China, or law enforcement, and (Project 2025 calls for) replacing them with partisan political hacks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help people’s pocketbooks, Vindman suggested building off the work of Democratic President Joe Biden to cap medication prices, including insulin, by placing limits on a broader range of medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Anderson, who said he understands that “there is climate change,” underscored that businesses have named electricity bills as their top expense, and that the economy could get back on track by prioritizing domestic production of energy. Anderson falsely claimed about 35 minutes into the UMW </span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538743-1/virginia-7th-congressional-district-debate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debate</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that the country is a “net importer rather than a net exporter of oil.” According to the Energy Information Agency, a federal government tracker of energy trends, the U.S. in 2023 imported about 8.51 million barrels per day of oil from 86 countries, </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=727&amp;t=6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to exporting about 10.15 million barrels per day of oil.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion rights are another major issue for voters nationwide, and the candidates in the 7th District reflect opposing views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has called for restoring Roe v. Wade, advocating for federal protections for abortion rights. Anderson, on the other hand, has stated that while he does not support a national ban on abortion, he believes the decision should be left to individual states, allowing them to determine their own abortion laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are two fundamental questions in this race: Will you restore women’s right to reproductive health care, as it was under Roe v. Wade?” Vindman asked. “And will you stand against a national abortion ban? I will restore Roe v. Wade, and I will stand against the national abortion ban.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, in the UMW debate, denied supporting a federal abortion ban, or taking away reproductive rights to in vitro fertilization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson also said he would support over the counter contraceptives, but in a previous </span><a href="https://starexponent.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/article_a5197e3e-7609-11ef-8e03-2bb78dfa980f.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forum </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for both the 7th and 10th congressional districts, he stopped short of saying if he would support a woman’s right to choose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I support the states to be able to make those decisions that best fits those states,” Anderson said at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson has falsely stated that former Gov. Ralph Northam supported infanticide, which is illegal in all 50 states. Northam was talking about </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">palliative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> care for babies born with complications during a 2019 interview that has been widely misquoted in every election cycle since.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On immigration, both candidates acknowledge issues at the U.S. southern border, but their approaches differ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has proposed reviving the Border Act of 2024, a federal measure aiming to address border security and immigration reform that nearly passed before </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/border-immigration-senate-vote-924f48912eecf1dc544dc648d757c3fe" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being blocked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by congressional Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Anderson has emphasized the need for strong immigration and foreign policies to enhance community safety, but he has not offered a specific plan or proposal to address the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with several other measures, the Senate proposal would have given the Department of Homeland Security emergency authority to shut down the border if daily migrant encounters reached 4,000 over a one-week span. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those crossings rose to over 5,000 on average per day in a given week, DHS would be required to close the border to migrants crossing through ports of entry. Some migrants could stay if they proved they were escaping torture or prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman said he would have supported the bill, which “would have been the toughest bill in decades, and we&#8217;re badly in need of comprehensive immigration reform.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks in the Patrick Henry Building Tuesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery efforts in Southwest Virginia following Hurricane Helene remain a priority for Gov. Glenn Youngkin as government resources continue to aid states affected by the storm’s devastation, including North Carolina, and soon Florida, where an extremely dangerous category 5 hurricane is predicted to make landfall Wednesday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking to reporters in Richmond on Tuesday, Youngkin highlighted the progress made in restoring services in Virginia’s hardest-hit areas, especially in the mountainous regions in the western part of the commonwealth. He noted that power had been restored to all but less than 200 customers in remote areas, with full service expected soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, all cell phone towers in the region have been repaired, ensuring communication abilities are back online.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boil water advisories for drinking water are down from 35 systems to 19 in the areas hardest hit by Helene, as water can still be used for other purposes. Test kits for well users are available at a disaster recovery </span><a href="https://www.vaemergency.gov/recover/hurricane-helene" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including one at the Damascus Shopping Mall in Washington County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two primary roads and 16 secondary roads remain impassable, Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are concerned about debris and chemicals in Claytor Lake in Pulaski County, and South Holston Lake in Washington County, as the bodies of water are used for hydroelectric power generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe this will be a 10 to 12-day period of just assessing and getting cleanup personnel on site,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical crews remain in the area, but Virginia does “not have a shortage,” of fluid </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-10-07/intravenous-fluids-shortage-baxter-international-marion-north-carolina" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supplies, Youngkin said. Health systems, however, are still determining if elective procedures can be delayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission is helping with job losses, Youngkin added, and the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is working with the </span><a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/10/04/usda-offers-resources-adds-flexibilities-disaster-assistance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States Department of Agriculture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assist with the potential “hundreds of millions of dollars of lost income from our agricultural community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual assistance has been </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/10/05/list-of-localities-declared-under-a-major-disaster-grows-to-nine-in-southwest-virginia/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the counties of Montgomery and Pulaski, as public assistance for local governments, has been expanded to Lee County. Most of those who have sought assistance have primarily used the </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FEMA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app, Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And less than two weeks after Helene hit the United States Southeast, claiming the lives of two in Virginia and over 227 people around the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-death-toll-asheville-north-carolina-34d1226bb31f79dfb2ff6827e40587fc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">region</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hurricane Milton is forecast to slam into the western coast of Florida.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milton is expected to head across the state into the Atlantic Ocean without an impact to Virginia, unless there’s an unexpected turn, which Youngkin said on Tuesday gave him confidence to deploy search and rescue and emergency management teams to support North Carolina. a He also sent the Helicopter Aquatic Rescue Team, a partnership with Virginia National Guard and Chesterfield County firefighter and EMS crews, to Florida in preparation for Milton’s arrival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked by the Virginia Mercury about protections for Southwest Virginia in the event of future flood events since the hurricane </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/24/health-department-urges-preparedness-ahead-of-peak-storm-season/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">season</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lasts until Nov. 30, Youngkin said that “protections are hard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As much as we’d like to build a giant wall, in addition to the wall we should build at the southern border, we have to be prepared,” Youngkin said, renewing his request from last week to not get “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/04/youngkin-shares-update-on-helene-damage-in-virginia-urges-to-not-be-distracted-by-climate-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">distracted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” by discussions about climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have great capabilities in order to make sure that loss of life is protected against, but, on top of that, we also know that our response capabilities are extraordinary as well,” Youngkin said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the demand for electrification grows, companies and specialists in Virginia are helping to develop the workforce necessary to build and maintain electric vehicles, connect consumers to electric transportation, and uncover resources to power low-emission vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, to attract and retain employees and build, sell, and maintain electric and low-emission vehicles, leaders in the respective industries said the commonwealth needs to provide incentives and support efforts to continue building an efficient charging infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders in the trade industry said one of the biggest misperceptions is that people can’t be successful unless they go to college. Experts said it&#8217;s one of the driving forces behind the shortages of electricians, mechanics and technicians. Trade workers are needed in the electric vehicle industry, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don Hall, president and CEO of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association, said Virginia can help by continuing its commitment to career and technical education (CTE) training as well as working with the federal government to develop an accessible and convenient charging infrastructure and create ways to invest and incentivize EV purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are many things the state can do, but both parties have been lacking in that arena,” said Hall. “Yet one party over the other says, ‘this is where we need to be’ [and] ‘we need to be selling more of them.’ Okay, I agree, but help us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear how state efforts on workforce development are focused on electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked why Gov. Glenn Youngkin nixed a proposed battery manufacturing plant slated for Virginia’s Southside, press secretary Martinez said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the governor “decided not to finance technology affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party using Virginia taxpayer money,” and pointed to other clean energy jobs the state is </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pursuing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/11/virginia-americas-top-state-for-business-nations-best-schools-solid-infrastructure.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">named</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the top state to do business in 2024 by CNBC. But the governor admitted that the commonwealth still has work to do in the area of workforce development, after CNBC ranked the state ninth on that measure, largely because of the shortage of educators moving to the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin told CNBC that the workforce grew by 240,000 since he took office in 2022, but that growth hasn’t included electric vehicle makers at a rate other Southeastern states are experiencing. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Building electric vehicles</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia businesses and higher education institutions are becoming involved with testing and developing semiconductor chips and building electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Virginia </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-micron-semiconductor-chips-lynchburg-batteries/article_973cc5fa-fda5-11ee-99bd-076706ef8fb7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on an incentive package with manufacturers to develop batteries and semiconductor chips used to support vehicles, after the country experienced a shortage in chip manufacturing. Micron, one of those manufacturers, designs the advanced fabrication for many of its chips in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delbert Parks, vice president and site executive at Micron Technology, said the chips are the backbone of the EVs. The chips also drive advancements in power electronics and electrification efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said developing a “robust and diverse talent pipeline” is essential for driving innovation in the semiconductor industry and supporting EV trends; some of that talent could come from . community colleges and universities. Students and university researchers can design and manufacture cutting-edge solutions, meet growing production demands, improve energy efficiency and maintain global competitiveness in the semiconductor industry and the EV revolution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micron has partnered with several Virginia colleges including Virginia Tech and Norfolk State University to grow the workforce and provide experiential learning opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The semiconductor industry is facing a global talent gap requiring industry, academic and government partnership to ensure we create pathways for students, K-PhD, to enter into our industry,&#8221; Parks said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of a grant from the National Science Foundation, the Bradley Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Virginia Tech has been working to advance semiconductor research and education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department also hosts workshops and summer camps to encourage high school students to pursue careers in semiconductor-related fields, and has been putting more emphasis on offering semiconductor chip courses in light of the nation’s shortage of chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo Trucks North America is one of the vehicle manufacturers in Virginia promoting the sale of heavy electric trucks, including tractor trailers.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40032" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-40032" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/NRV-Site-Aerial-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Volvo Group North America New River Valley Plant located in Dublin, VA. (Courtesy of Volvo Group North America)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling itself the largest manufacturing employer in Southwest, Virginia, the company employs about 36,000 people at its plant in the New River Valley and says its been committed “from the beginning” to building an educated workforce for those selling and working on the trucks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the dealer certification process, all employees receive safety and basic EV training and a minimum of two technicians per location must be certified,” said Bobby Compton, product marketing manager at Volvo Trucks North America. “Traditionally, these technicians have experience working on traditional (internal combustion engine) powertrains and are adding the skill set for zero-emissions-vehicles.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has benefited from the Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which equates to a $40,000 tax credit for buying an electric battery truck. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IRA, President Joe Biden’s landmark law regarded as the largest investment in climate policy in the country&#8217;s history, has offered tax credits to incentivize the creation of electric manufacturing facilities throughout the country. The Southeast has taken advantage of those offerings, giving the region the name “battery belt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The policy has been using funding from the IRA and 48C tax credits to spur EV component development. This is </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/podcasts/the-daily/biden-electric-vehicles.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create domestic manufacturing and make EV purchase tax rebates, which require components to be made in the U.S.A., more accessible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Virginia has not been part of that movement, although it has come close. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state almost became home to a battery plant in Danville, but the Richmond Times-Dispatch </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/ford-disputes-reporting-on-pittsylvania-county-pick-for-battery-project/article_3fce0f3e-9697-11ed-9b9d-d309e4bf363a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in January 2023 Youngkin pulled the plug because of a concern over connections to China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“His concerns were validated when Ford scaled </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/ford-pausing-construction-of-battery-plant-that-had-been-considered-in-virginia/article_480a2dae-5bf4-11ee-9ec7-ffe193373d83.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Michigan battery plant plans, resulting in fewer jobs than anticipated, and the Defense Authorization Act </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/us-will-ban-pentagon-procuring-batteries-from-china-s-catl-byd" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Pentagon from purchasing batteries based on (Chinese-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited technology),” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in Dec. 2023, Microporous, a Tennessee-based company that manufactures lead-acid battery separators, was the recipient of a $100 million grant from the federal government through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to potentially invest over $1 billion and create 282 jobs to build a lithium-ion battery plant in Virginia’s Pittsylvania County. But no final decision has been made and the company is considering building the plant in other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brad Reed, vice president of corporate development at Microporous, said the U.S. Department of Energy and the Virginia Economic Development Partnership are working to finalize a grant agreement and incentives package before year’s end.  Among the other states, Virginia was the “best for support offered in the area of workforce recruitment and development,” Reed said, but offered lower financial services compared to North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No final decisions or public announcements will be made until these are finalized and approved,” Reed said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in April, Applied Materials, the second company alongside Micron to receive a state incentive package, received $100 million in federal funding to open a battery plant in Lynchburg. The public </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/04/22/5-ways-the-battery-plant-planned-for-lynchburg-is-significant/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this move as a way for Virginia to enter the battery belt industry. But in August, </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/02/battery-plant-backed-by-100-million-federal-grant-no-longer-planned-for-lynchburg/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> broke that the company had scrapped its plans without a clear answer as to why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked what other EV component manufacturing plants the state was pursuing, Martinez, with the governor’s office, said “the administration is actively working on several economic development opportunities,” and pointed to successful 48C tax credit awardings, used to spur domestic clean energy development, luring in other engineering-related manufacturing operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those included a $681 million investment from GreenLink LS in </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/july/name-1030531-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make a submarine transmission cable for offshore wind projects, and an over $400 million investment by Topsoe, a carbon emission </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/may/name-1026403-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> company, in Chesterfield County. Those investments received $235 million in the 48C tax credits, “the third most of any state in the nation,” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The administration has and will continue to leverage available federal dollars to unleash economic growth in Virginia,” Martinez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Atlas Public Policy </span><a href="https://www.cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/Transportation-Electrification-in-the-Southeast-2023-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the end of last year that Florida, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia, had announced the addition of 65,242 manufacturing jobs and $60 billion in investment by building out the battery belt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noting that announcements of the jobs may not always come to fruition, the report stated, “One factor in the growth of EV jobs in the Southeast is the significant economic incentive packages offered by state and local governments.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Maintaining EVs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While EVs require less maintenance, Matt Shepanek, vice president for credential testing programs with the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE), said it&#8217;s a “misconception” that there won’t be any jobs available for technicians in the EV industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With EVs, you don&#8217;t have some of the maintenance items, like there&#8217;s no oil and power steering fluid and things like that, but there&#8217;s still plenty of things that technicians need to do, as far as diagnostics and just overall vehicle care.” Shepnaek said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, ASE created a free </span><a href="https://ase.com/ev" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV safety standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> document, which the institute and members in the vehicle industry developed. The institute also started providing testing programs to help technicians and salespeople become certified to work and provide information to consumers about electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shepanek said well over 5,000 people have participated in both testing programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, car manufacturers have also trained technicians to work on their vehicles at service stations and shops and taught salespeople to understand vehicle details important to consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dan Banister, chair of the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association and owner of Banister Automotive, said car manufacturers such as Nissan and Ford have provided extensive training for his technicians at five dealerships, four of which are in Virginia and the other in Maryland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the age of electrification, Banister said the role of technicians has changed, with some experts primarily using tools such as wrenches and now computers. He credits secondary schools and community colleges, including those in Chesapeake, for creating opportunities for students and the automotive industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need people out there willing to get their certifications (and) to help with all the skills we&#8217;re lacking right now,” Banister said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banister said it’s important to have certified employees available to meet the demands of all their customers including those with EVs. On average, he said technicians work on four to five EVs a month with warranty work or tire replacements.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a real need for electricians trained to install chargers and charging stations around the commonwealth, with electric vehicle owners and future consumers increasingly searching for access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Skelly, business manager with IBEW Local 666, which represents and trains electricians, said the organization is helping new and experienced electricians prepare for the wave of charger installations. Those installations require electricians to be familiar with electrical load calculations and code requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the manufacturing jobs that are coming countrywide from the IRA and other laws that have come out recently &#8230; there&#8217;s just an extreme demand for electricians right now,&#8221; Skelly said. Class sizes have increased from 20 to 25 students per class in the last few years. The number of classes  per semester has increased from two to three this fall, with 75 new apprentices starting. The program has 300 apprentices total. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://evitp.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Training Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the primary program for electricians to complete to install chargers, requires applicants to have 8,000 documented hours of fieldwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re neck deep in making sure we&#8217;re prepared for the work,&#8221; Skelly said, adding that their training can vary from residential to commercial and industrial levels. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jobs: Uncovering resources</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Energy Agency found that 1.46 carbon dioxide equivalents, the same amount produced by 164 gallons of gasoline, are emitted when mining for lithium carbonate, a component of lithium-ion batteries that power a majority of electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are no major mining operations in the commonwealth, mineral mining is one practice in Virginia that could yield some success in collecting non-fuel minerals. However, there are environmental concerns about digging for resources, and processing minerals can add more emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the IEA found that making an electric vehicle emits less climate-changing emissions than gas-power internal combustion engine cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Total lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of EVs are around half those of internal combustion engine cars on average, with the potential for a further 25% reduction with low-carbon electricity,” the IEA </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/sustainable-and-responsible-development-of-minerals" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trip Pollard, with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said that’s the evidence to support electric vehicles instead of ones that guzzle gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Overall, when you look at the environmental toll, you know the entire process of a gas-powered vehicle and an electric vehicle,” Pollard said. “Hands down, you&#8217;re better off with electric vehicles, which is why we support that transition.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40119" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-40119" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  EVgo chargers deployed by the Department of Environmental Quality at a gas station in Richmond.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. has a ban on </span><a href="https://www.state.gov/conflict-minerals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conflict minerals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which come from countries known to have human rights violations. Cobalt, a mineral explored as a more efficient power source for batteries, can come from the Democratic Republic of Congo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, introduced a bill this past session to prevent public bodies, including state and local governments, from procuring an electric vehicle unless the manufacturer swears child labor wasn’t involved in the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At an August meeting when discussing his bill, Stanley said finding “clean energy sources … is a policy decision that the commonwealth has made and rightly so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Stanley continued, “I still believe that we can make a general inquiry and determine what nation states, what countries are mining this cobalt rationally, reasonably and without harm to their children or to their citizenry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scapegoating electric vehicles in that pursuit isn’t fair, Pollard said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we&#8217;re really concerned about this issue, which is a serious issue, it should apply to all products, don&#8217;t single out EVs,” Pollard said. “I think there are concerns that need to be addressed, and, absolutely, (the SELC is) involved in a couple of projects that are mining projects in the south. They&#8217;re pushing for more steps to be taken to minimize any adverse environmental impacts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has nearly all of the 50 critical minerals in the state in trace elements, including Cobalt, which has a “moderate potential” for economic development, and lithium, which has an “unknown potential.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sixteen of the elements have high potential for development,” said Tarah Kesteron, a spokeswoman for Virginia Energy. “These include the 14 rare earth elements (REEs), titanium, and zirconium.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company that mines for titanium and zirconium is Atlantic Strategic Metals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement on the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/12/petersburg-based-company-to-reactivate-mining-operations-in-dinwiddie-sussex/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reactivation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the mine in Dinwiddie and Sussex counties, Christopher Wyatt, the CEO said that Virginia had “a knowledgeable and talented workforce.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More broadly, Virginia is exploring ways to procure rare earth elements from waste </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/SD3/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/08/four-takeaways-from-southwest-virginias-critical-mineral-investigation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">innovative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ways to find critical minerals in the earth or mined coal, through an initiative with Virginia Tech called Evolve Central Appalachia, or CAPP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work around minerals is part of the transition that the Natural Resources Defense Council said can be more affordable than spending  $1,117 a year to fuel a gas-powered vehicle, compared to $485 a year to fuel an electric one, the group found, citing a University of Michigan </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/electric-vs-gas-cars-it-cheaper-drive-ev" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The cost saving also comes with benefits for humans and the planet they call home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At 20 pounds of co2 for every </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/greenhouse-gas-emissions-typical-passenger-vehicle#:~:text=How%20can%20burning%20one%20gallon,the%20carbon%20and%20hydrogen%20separate." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gallon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s burned, this is a phenomenal number of carbon dioxide molecules that are released in gasoline,” said Harned. “I think that the social cost of carbon, the impacts around people&#8217;s lives, the refugee movements, the economic harms from the additional storms, the heat events and the loss of life, that will over time reduce our consumption.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of Christian Martinez, Office of Governor Glenn Youngkin)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restoration efforts in Southwest Virginia continue after Hurricane Helene’s deadly impact, as Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin asserted that blaming the intense storm and the future unpredictability of weather on climate change was a distraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While giving an update on damage assessments from the storm that made landfall in Florida last week and dumped several inches of rain, with two confirmed tornados, in the mountainous regions of Virginia, Youngkin urged people to call 1-800-621-3362, go to FEMA.gov or use a FEMA app download to seek help and start documenting the application process for federal recovery funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, there are regional centers that are being established by FEMA and (partner)with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management in the area,” Youngkin said, adding people are going door-to-door to help people fill out forms as part of the Major Disaster Declaration the state </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/post-helene-virginia-granted-major-disaster-declaration-access-to-federal-funding-for-recovery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a really important process,” Youngkin said. “Many people don’t know how to fill out these forms. Getting them the help that they need is critically important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the update from federal, state and local officials at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management Emergency Operations Center in North Chesterfield Friday morning, VDEM spokesman John Elmore reported that 519 homes had been counted as damaged so far, with 44 destroyed, and 475 damaged or affected. The total number of impacted businesses, ranging from small ones to large manufacturers, had climbed to 83. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These counts, which don’t include damages to local government buildings, are expected to go up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two people died in the immediate wake of the storm, and Youngkin said that everybody has been accounted for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 13,700 people are still without power in the region, Youngkin said, after about 96% of outages had been restored. Crews are using helicopters to deliver telephone poles to the hard to reach areas that remain. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the 287 cell-phone service towers that were knocked out, 14 still needed to be fixed, the governor added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, 28 water systems are under a boil advisory, and Youngkin urged everyone in the region to flush systems and seek replacement pumps, particularly for well users that comprise a vast majority of residents in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools in “many counties” remained closed Friday, while others were having delays, Youngkin said. Waivers have been requested by the federal government so meal services for disadvantaged families could be extended to all school children. About 40,000 meals had been given out, in addition to grassroots efforts, as a medical reserve corps of professionals from other regions in the states have trekked to the impacted area to help with medication, oxygen tanks and wheelchairs that “have been just washed away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two primary roads remain impassible, and 52 secondary rods are closed, and U.S. Route 58 has about a 1.5 mile stretch that is “absolutely impossible,” Youngkin added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is going to be a long restoration rebuild process, but I am confident that if we can just keep focus, and not allow the standard ‘it’s been two weeks now and we’re moving on to the next issue’ to settle in, because I will not allow that to happen,” Youngkin said, adding that Southwest Virginia will rebuild “stronger than it was before.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to the staff at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While taking questions from reporters, Youngkin declined to share his thoughts about climate change’s influence when a Virginia Mercury reporter asked about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody get distracted by that question,” said Youngkin, who in 2022 acknowledged climate change was a “</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-virginia-utilities-nuclear-power-generation-df7fa2571b5d875ac1fe9af1e0b52c35" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” in an interview about his energy plan, which called for a re-evaluation of the state’s Virginia Clean Economy Act. The landmark 2020 VCEA seeks to decarbonize the grid by mid-century to halt human-caused </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/12/as-smoke-from-canada-enters-virginia-research-links-climate-change-with-more-frequent-wildfires/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are right now in a moment of providing people a pathway back to hope,” Youngkin continued, before talking about the gratitude he received for his visits, including an afternoon visit by U.S. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, the Republican vice presidential nominee, on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yesterday, when Senator Vance was there and everyone was saying ‘thank you for coming,’ this is a region of Virginia and America that has historically been forgotten,” Youngkin said. “I just have no time for folks who are trying to politicize this moment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FEMA administrator Deanne Criswell said on the CBS news program </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/deanne-criswell-fema-administrator-face-the-nation-transcript-09-29-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Face the Nation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Sunday that  “In the past, when we would look at damage from hurricanes, it was primarily wind damage, with some water damage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But now we’re seeing so much more water damage, and I think that is a result of the warm waters, which is a result of climate change,” Criswell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After FEMA had denied relief requests from residents in the region in 2022 and 2021, the state dipped into $830 million in revenues from a carbon-market that requires electricity producers to purchase allowances for carbon emissions as another attempt to halt climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state directed $29 million of the funds, which were initially intended to increase flood protections and make homes energy efficient, to provide relief to residents. Youngkin pulled Virginia out of the market — the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — calling it a “hidden tax,” since utilities can recover the costs of allowances from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/regulators-approve-request-from-dominion-to-drop-rggi-fee-on-customer-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ratepayers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators used a budget amendment to appropriate any unused funds, which amounted to about $40 million at the start of the year, according to a </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-10-03/youngkin-virginia-legislators-mull-legislative-steps-in-helene-recovery" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Radio IQ. A special session would be needed to pass a similar budget amendment or legislation to support the region ahead of the regular session scheduled to start in January.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve got to assess what we need,” Youngkin said when asked if he would call one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Democratic President Joe Biden’s approval of the declaration, which the state sought  in the days following the storm. The aid, which can come in the form of grants, low-interest loans and other programs, will allow residents to seek individual assistance money to repair damages to homes and property. Local governments may apply  for public assistance to reimburse some of their costs incurred while responding to the storm. First responders and the National Guard performed over 70 swift water rescues statewide to save residents from rising floodwaters. Two people died as a result of the storm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The major disaster declaration is a crucial step to help the region recover, following the emergency disaster declaration Biden approved Sunday evening to help with the immediate response and rescue efforts. Wednesday’s declaration allows people in the following jurisdictions who were affected by Helene beginning Wednesday, Sept. 25, the day before the storm made landfall, to apply for funding:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 1 p.m. Wednesday, Appalachian Power Company said about 36,300 customers remain without power in Virginia, after the utility saw a peak of 282,000 customers without power in Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, FEMA officials began </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/09/30/fema-aid-to-southwest-virginia-to-be-determined-in-the-wake-of-hurricane-helene/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">assessing </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">how much might be requested from the federal government, according to Cardinal News. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of U.S. Senators, including Virginia’s Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, wrote to Senate leadership on Oct. 1 that early estimates of damage and economic loss will reach over “tens of billions of dollars.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who called the storm the most significant disaster in the state since 2011, said Wednesday he was thankful the state received the major disaster declaration and expressed gratitude to Warner, Kaine and U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, the representative for the 9th Congressional District spanning much of the affected region, who all signed on to a letter seeking the previous emergency declaration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This will allow us to get resources to our impacted communities and Virginians as fast as possible,” Youngkin said. “We will continue to work to add jurisdictions as additional assessments occur in impacted areas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has also praised the cooperation from FEMA’s cooperation, including during preparation for the storm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some community advocates question whether or not the FEMA funds will actually reach people in Virginia’s impacted communities, because the money may </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-mulls-calling-congress-back-to-pass-disaster-funds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been provided in the temporary budget deal, called a “continuing resolution,” that Biden signed on Sept. 26 to keep the federal government running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A FEMA spokesperson said the resolution provided “sufficient funding for disaster relief fund needs.” But Appalachian Voices, a nonprofit grassroots organization working in Virginia’s mountainous communities, said FEMA had already exhausted its disaster relief funds prior to Helene and isn’t scheduled to reconvene until Nov. 12.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we’ve learned anything in the almost 20 years since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, we know that robust federal funding is critical to our success right now,” said Chelsea Barnes, director of government affairs and strategy at Appalachian Voices. “Appalachians are resilient, and we will rebuild. But we need Congress to return to Washington and pass disaster funding now.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The senators’ Oct. 1 letter urged Congress to act to “meet the unmet needs in our states and address the scope and scale of destruction experienced by our constituents,” and suggested this may “require Congress to come back in October to ensure we have enough time to enact legislation before the end of this calendar year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> storms that hit Southwest Virginia, the towns of Hurley and Whitewood saw about four to six inches of rain over an up to roughly nine-hour period in 2021 and in 2022, respectively. Buchanan County, where the two towns are located, asked FEMA for $1.57 million in individual assistance for the Hurley flood and $1.9 million in individual assistance for the Whitewood flood, money that would help residents impacted by the disasters, but was denied its requests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The locality did receive $2.6 million in public assistance FEMA funding to help the local government recover from the Hurley flood, and FEMA awarded $3.8 million in the same type of aid to Buchanan and nearby Tazewell County for the Whitewood flood recovery efforts. FEMA also provided the state funding to buy and tear down nearly three dozen structures in Buchanan to prevent future flooding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FEMA spokesperson said Wednesday residents could find more details on if they would qualify for aid on the agency’s </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual Assistance </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The limited individual FEMA funding for Hurley and Whitewood flood victims prompted the Virginia legislature to pull $11 million and $18 million respectively, from revenues from the regional carbon market known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for relief efforts. The state also said at the time it would explore creating a state program to fill in gaps with FEMA funding through legislation in the 2025 session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Virginia Department of Emergency Management State Coordinator Shawn Talmadge said “We’re not really sure right now” if any proposals will be put forward in January when the 2025 session begins.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More severe weather ahead?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although earlier this week state and federal officials were urging caution for another storm forming off the Gulf Coast that could hit the region, Ben Gruver, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service’s </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/rnk/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blacksburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> office, said a high pressure system is forecast to bring “tranquil” dry weather through next week. The storm south of the Gulf has a 40% chance of forming at this point, Gruver added, and if it does develop, it would likely be after the next seven days and it’s uncertain if it would impact Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where it goes beyond that is anybody’s guess at this point,” Gruver said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the growing number of electric vehicles is expected to cause the demand on Virginia’s electric grid to surge, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company are actively preparing for the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, conservation groups are monitoring the impact on the environment and Virginians, ensuring that the transition is as sustainable as possible and of less concern than data centers that are prompting continued fossil fuel use as a dispatchable power source.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transition to electric vehicles is intended to remove tailpipe greenhouse gasses that make up one third of the emissions in the state and nationwide, contributing to climate change-fueled increasing storm intensities and frequencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is also navigating the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law that seeks to transition Dominion and Appalachian Power to zero-carbon generation sources by 2050 to reduce emissions from the power sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy, the state’s largest utility with 2.6 million customers serving large swaths of Northern Virginia, the Richmond region and Hampton Roads, is pursuing a suite of zero-carbon generation sources like solar, offshore wind and nuclear in order to meet its projected demand on the grid, or “load growth,” which includes more electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the utility is also proposing a carbon-emitting natural gas plant, largely needed for data center growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to think about meeting load 24/7, so you&#8217;re going to see a mix of both renewable and dispatchable resources to meet that growth,” said Nathan Frost, general manager of new business and customer solutions at Dominion. “I feel, again, very confident that we can meet the load associated with EVs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trip Pollard, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, cautioned that some “concerns are definitely legitimate” when it comes to whether clean cars contribute to skyrocketing energy needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But a lot of the rhetoric has been very overblown, especially by the fossil fuel industry and politicians who derive a lot of donations from the fossil fuel industry,” Pollard added. “There&#8217;s far, far greater impact from things like data centers, which are still provided taxpayer subsidies.”</span></p>
<p><b>How does the grid work? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though people don’t see them when they plug a toaster into a power outlet or flip on a power switch, utility companies are always managing the power grid, an interconnected network, to provide electricity to customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the country, the power grid has come under strain to meet all the electricity demands to power data centers that support entertainment devices, kitchen appliances and even electric and low-emission vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grid’s work begins with electricity being created by a generation source, such as a solar panel or natural gas plant. Then, power is sent through transmission lines that are carried by the tall steel towers seen along highways and through countrysides. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those transmission lines connect to substations, where higher voltage electricity is converted to lower power so it can be delivered across distribution lines, the wooden poles along roadways. Distribution lines then connect to transformers to send electricity to homes, businesses, electric vehicle chargers and more. The whole system is evolving to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for power. </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have the grid transformation plan that&#8217;s been underway going back to 2019,” Frost said. “That is again another comprehensive approach to making sure that we&#8217;ve got an electric distribution grid that can meet the needs of tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Theresa Hamilton Hall, spokeswoman for Appalachian Power, a utility company that provides services in Southwest Virginia, said the company is also working to address customers’ new needs, including “enabling EV charging at home, while they shop, or are on a road trip.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Appalachian Power typically extends a secondary service from the company’s primary system by setting an appropriately sized transformer and service conductors (wire) that will handle the maximum demand of the charging station(s),” Hall said.</span></p>
<p><b>Can the grid support the increase?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power and Dominion are confident the power grid will be able to support the increase in demand for electricity. However, there is still uncertainty about when that increase will begin, and exactly how much EVs will contribute to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were 91,000 all-electric cars registered in Virginia as of June 30, but Dominion has projected an adoption of over 220,000 passenger electric vehicles by 2027, and the peak need from electric vehicles by 2038 is 1,600 megawatts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is what we do all day, every day,” Frost said. “Whether it&#8217;s connecting a home or business or an EV charger, we take all of it very seriously.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hall, with Appalachian Power, said the utility is anticipating modest growth related to electric vehicle adoption across the company’s three-state service territory, growth that is accounted for in Appalachian Power’s load forecasting models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Using information gleaned from the amount of electric load carried on the company’s circuits and stations, and other internal data, this model allows the company to identify areas of future load growth on the system that may require improvements to the distribution system infrastructure,” Hall said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SELC hired consultants to do an analysis and concluded that the Clean Car Standards are only projected to increase the demand about 4% by 2040.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40258" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/virginias-electric-vehicle-transition-depends-on-the-power-grid-how-is-it-faring/20240710_1840122/" rel="attachment wp-att-40258"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40258" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="2214" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-300x259.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-1024x885.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-768x664.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-1536x1328.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20240710_1840122-2048x1771.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A Rappahannock Electric Cooperative substation with distribution lines next to it. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the smaller municipal electric grids in Virginia, including the Harrisonburg Electric Commission, and Electric Cooperatives that serve rural areas, it’s the transmission and distribution lines that need thoughtful planning, some utilities say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I look at my [utility] peers and, we&#8217;re all in this and scratching our heads, trying to say, how do we do this in a more efficient way to be able to address the growth that we&#8217;re seeing?” said Peter Muhoro, chief strategy, technology &amp; innovation officer at Rappahannock Electric Cooperative, serving the Central Piedmont region. One solution the company is exploring is pairing a battery with a charger so higher voltage power can be stored and distributed more easily on site, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, which supplies the power to the cooperatives, relies on a planning tool developed by University of California at Davis to stay aware of EV adoption for forecasting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ODEC and (the Virginia, Maryland and Delaware Association of Electric Cooperatives) have a collaborative working group with VDOT, Virginia Energy and Virginia Clean Cities, which meets quarterly so the state agencies are aware of what cooperatives are doing in preparation for EV adoption in their services territories,” said Kirby Jordan, a spokesperson for ODEC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian O’Dell, general manager at Harrisonburg Electric Commission, added that when the chargers are built close to each other, strain on specific points in the grid  need attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know that we&#8217;re heavily into forecasting, because that seems to be a little bit of a moving target, but it does require us to keep tabs on our distribution system, making sure things are balanced and not overloaded,” O’Dell said.</span></p>
<p><b>Impact on Virginians </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the electricity demand increases, questions around the cost for ratepayers are driving public concerns.</span></p>
<p>Garrett Gee, a senior attorney at SELC, said his group petitioned the Virginia State Corporation Commission to have the utilities do more comprehensive planning.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans for electrification of vehicles were filed in May 2023, but updates are now due February 2025, after environmental groups asked for a better public picture of what the utilities are expecting in terms of medium- and long-term energy demand, and the plans the utilities have to mitigate some of that demand with part of the investments that will be required and paid for by ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes deliberate work, I think, from policymakers, as EV adoption increases to make sure that stays the case,” Gee said. “It doesn&#8217;t just happen, but it&#8217;s something that we can do, and we need to do.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2025 session beginning in January, representatives from the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit organization advocating for electric vehicles, said they would like to see legislative support for utilities to be able to pre-plan for medium- and heavy-duty growth and rural EV deployment expanded across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As this becomes the norm, and people want the choice for how they propel their vehicle and fuel it every day, we don&#8217;t want people in the rural regions of the state to be left behind,” said Jordan Neerhoff, senior policy analyst with the Electrification Coalition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb107" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, in the 2024 session would have provided funding to offset some of the non-utility costs for installing chargers in rural areas. It ultimately failed in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is going to be a problem in our rural areas,” said Cheri Conca, transportation and smart growth program manager for the Virginia Chapter of the Sierra Club.</span></p>
<p><b>Ratepayer opportunities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utility providers are offering ratepayers and electric vehicle owners incentives to install chargers at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of several <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/save-energy/electric-vehicles" target="_blank">programs</a> available to EV drivers, Dominion offers $40 a year to residents who participate in a demand response program to reduce charging at peak system load and encourage charging during off-peak hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also have time of use rates, which are time varying rates that incentivize customers to charge off peak or overnight to the extent they want to,” Frost said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power’s Virginia residential customers similarly can </span><a href="https://apcova.clearesult.com/shop-rebates/electric-vehicles" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a $100 rebate towards the purchase of an Energy Star rated Level-2 EV charger, and also use a similar time of use schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Customers who charge off-peak save money, and programs like this help us keep the grid working for everyone,” Hall said. “As demand grows and we make improvements to the electric grid, we are also using those opportunities to make the grid more reliable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gee said SELC has pushed both Dominion and Appalachian Power to adopt electricity rates to encourage people to charge their cars at night, when there is more renewable energy available or when there is less overall demand for power. He said the idea aims to balance the energy use and ensure that the grid benefits from a more steady and efficient use of electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of places now, like California, are seeing that it makes a lot of sense for fleets to charge in the middle of the day,” Gee said. “That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s really important to do this planning at the state level.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Monday gave the update on deaths from the storm that hit several states in the Southeast, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia. Over 100 are dead, the Associated Press </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-asheville-f02869c7d01e68f2d7f0553abb82252f" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are bringing resources to bear in an unprecedented way for Southwest Virginia,” Youngkin said. “I heard over, and over and over again: ‘I’ve lived here for 70, 80 years, I’ve never seen anything like this.’ That has been clear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin gave his update at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management Emergency Operations Center Monday afternoon, a day after President Joe Biden approved an Emergency Disaster Declaration to unlock assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency to aid responses in the counties of Grayson, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington, Wise, and Wythe, as well as the city of Galax. Another thirteen counties and five cities are expected to be added, Youngkin said.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks with Virginia Department of Emergency Management staff. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Weather Service, the city of Galax saw a </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/akq/rainfall-monitoring" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dumping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of about 8.6 inches of rain over a 72 hour period. The town of Damascus, with a population of about 788 people in Washington County, saw </span><a href="https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/?m=real&amp;r=va" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">19.5 feet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of flooding in the southern end of the New River Valley, which experienced high waters as far north as Radford University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They put out guidance that this would be a horrific season, with almost 30 storms, yet, here we are, we’re only on Helene,” said Shawn Talmadge, state coordinator at VDEM, referencing how storms are named in alphabetical order. “But this storm itself is unique. It rapidly intensifies, made landfall very quickly as a [Category 4] and then started interacting with this unusual environment, just huge amounts and volumes of rain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 70 swift water rescue operations have occurred, with Virginia National Guard members rappelling from helicopters and pulling people from cars, Youngkin said. Helicopter crews out of Abingdon helped rescue about 50 people from the roof of a hospital in Tennessee by building a makeshift platform to land on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a life-changing storm for many people and communities,&#8221; said Tom Cormons, executive director of Appalachian Voices, an environmental non-profit with grassroots efforts throughout Appalachia. “Recovery is going to be a long, difficult process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the peak of the storm, about 282,000 Appalachian Power customers in the region were without power. That number was down to 83,000 as of 1 p.m. Monday, the </span><a href="https://www.aepnationalcustomers.com/outages/storms/details?stormUpdateID=205&amp;id=48" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said in a news release. The CEOs of Appalachian Power Company and its parent company American Electric Power visited the region, Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An issue responders are still dealing with is the lack of cell-phone service. The state has deployed mobile towers to provide service in the meantime, Youngkin said. If possible,residents are urged to call 211 or visit vaemergency.gov for ways to get help. Impacted residents may also stop by shelters where they can shower and get meals, which have been handed out by incarcerated members under coordination with the Department of Corrections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know a lot of people want to stay where they are, but sometimes it&#8217;s just not safe,” said Youngkin.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40236" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1200px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/30/hurricane-helene-deaths-in-virginia-up-to-2-future-rain-prompts-more-concern/unnamed-2-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-40236"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40236" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="797" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2.jpg 1200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/unnamed-2-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Gov. Glenn Youngkin and First Lady Suzanne S. Youngkin assesses storm damage caused by Hurricane Helene in Grayson County.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Forestry had cleared 817 miles of roadways by Sunday afternoon, but road closures have added 30 minute- to hour long-detours in the region that already had minimal thoroughfares to go around mountainous terrain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regions further east and north in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia also saw road closures, including five in Albemarle County where one road was </span><a href="https://www.vdot.virginia.gov/news-events/news/culpeper-district/helene-may-have-left-va-but-effects-remain-behind.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">washed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out and will need to be rebuilt. In Madison County, route 670, or Old Blue Ridge Turnpike, was washed out, as Route 637, or Mutton Hollow Road, in Greene County was closed due to high water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with farmers having hay crops and berry farms ruined, and residents needing oxygen tanks and medication, Youngkin said dams, including the Appalachian Power Company hydroelectric power dam, were a concern going into the storm. But as the water receded, so did officials’ caution. The concern now is areas like Claytor Lake in the New River Valley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re worried about what&#8217;s in the water behind the dam,” said Youngkin. “The combination of both our surface rescue teams and hazmat teams are working to get as much stuff out of the water as we can. Propane tanks, in the water, we got to get them out. There’s floating cars, there’s all kinds of stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Youngkin added, the state would be submitting its request for a Major Disaster Declaration, which will release federal funds to provide post-disaster relief for families in the form of individual assistance as well as reimbursing localities for their costs through public assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, nor Timothy S. Pheil, federal FEMA federal coordinating officer, knew exactly how much the state was going to request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s going to be big, we’re going (through) all the thresholds. I can’t begin to estimate,” Youngkin said. “Aggregating the personal loss, business losses … we had local law enforcement offices that were flooded. All of that has got to be assessed. It’s a lot.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Potentially complicating the post-disaster relief, though, is that FEMA funds were left out of a congressional budget compromise reached a couple weeks ago, amid partisan disagreement, to keep the federal government running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is my understanding that Congress would have to return in order to approve supplemental disaster funds,” said Emily Steinhilber, director of climate resilient coasts and watersheds for Virginia at the Environmental Defense Fund. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service in Blacksburg is forecasting scattered showers and a possible thunderstorm through Tuesday night at the Brookneal/Campbell County Airport, which is about 30 minutes south of Lynchburg. Another </span><a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forming off the Gulf Coast is prompting fresh concerns, Youngkin said, as it could hit the region already inundated with water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Particularly, the New River Valley is still angry,” Youngkin said. “The river is angry and full, and more rain is only going to make that worse. The whole stretch up the New River Valley has real risk associated with it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary-Carson Stiff, executive director of the nonprofit Wetlands Watch, said it&#8217;s the hurricanes that heat up in the Gulf’s increasingly warmer waters that are dumping “unimaginable amounts of rain in rivers and creeks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia&#8217;s communities are already experiencing roughly 20% more rainfall since 2006, so when you add more rain from a big storm into our already full water bodies and stressed infrastructure, the outcome is disastrous,” Stiff said. </span></p>

(Map courtesy of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One person is reported dead in Virginia and five localities in the southwest region of the state are under a voluntary evacuation order as a result of Tropical Depression Helene, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a Facebook live </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=842692187932999" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around 4 p.m. Friday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one fatality in Craig County stemmed from a tree falling and a building collapse, Youngkin said, adding that “We lift up the family of this victim in our prayers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augusta, Wythe, Pulaski, and Giles Counties are under the voluntary evacuation order, along with the city of Salem. Residents there aren’t required to leave their homes, but the order strongly suggests that it would be safest to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While these are voluntary evacuation orders for particular communities, please adhere to them for your safety. Your life is too important,” the governor said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helene formed south of Florida and made landfall as a hurricane in that state late Thursday with maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour, according to the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-florida-georgia-carolina-e5769b56dea81e40fae2161ad1b4e75d" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet, the impacts could be felt in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service Blacksburg Office forecasted Friday morning that rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour were likely. According to the </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/akq/rainfall-monitoring" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NWS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 12.2 inches of rain had accumulated in the Grayson Highlands area in Southside Virginia near the North Carolina border as of 4 p.m. Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said that while rain “may have subsided in certain parts of Virginia,” a tornado was reported just north of Danville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A vast section of the state is still under a tornado watch, and that extends all the way to Virginia Beach” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 50 swift water crews had already been deployed with helicopter air support, “although the high winds have limited their ability to access some of the more challenged spots,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helicopters were able to help efforts in Washington County, particularly the city of Damascus, where “we have seen substantial flooding,” Younkgin said. Flooding has also occurred along the New River, particularly at Radford University, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I urge everyone to please stay informed, use good judgments and get to high ground,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 241,000 people have lost power throughout Southwest Virginia, Youngkin added. The state has been in contact with the electric cooperatives that primarily serve rural regions in Southwest Virginia, and Appalachian Power Company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s going to take some time,” Youngkin said, on restoring power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia State Police helicopter unit was sent to help with the 50 people stranded on the roof of Unicoi County Hospital in </span><a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2024/09/27/tennessee-flood-people-stranded-roof-ballad-health-hospital-erwin-unicoi-county/75414357007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennessee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Youngkin said. At least 40 people in four states had died from the storm by Friday evening, according to the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-florida-georgia-carolina-e5769b56dea81e40fae2161ad1b4e75d" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Chesterfield County police dispatch relayed break-in attempt before fatal shooting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Court records obtained by </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/new-audio-charles-byers-shooting-sept-24-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WTVR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed information dispatchers gave Chesterfield police officers before they fatally shot Charles Byers on July 8, 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the news station, police responded after a resident on Wycliff Court reported Byers breaking through a window to enter a home where he told the resident he thought he was at his family’s house and asked for water. Another resident reported Byers tried to enter his home and appeared to be “messed up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dispatcher relayed the breaking and entering attempt through the window to the officers. The officer, who fatally shot Byers as he was walking away from them with a hatchet in his hand, had asked about any crimes committed so far and if he made entry into anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks like he vandalized one residence. Other than that, I’m not seeing anything,” the dispatcher responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byers’ family is suing Chesterfield County over the death, arguing the crimes committed by him didn’t warrant the use of deadly force. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">County attorneys are seeking a dismissal, saying Byers had “squared up” with the officer and the reported crimes would lead a reasonable responding officer to believe a “potentially dangerous crime” was in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney for Byers’ family contended the officer was only aware of a misdemeanor, and that Byers never made a threatening motion with the hatchet toward the officers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A judge is considering whether the case has merit to continue. The Byers family is also suing HCA’s Chippenham Hospital and the city of Richmond for jointly and improperly removing Byers from a mental health facility, despite a court order directing him to be there.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond finance department doesn’t tell business owners about money they’re owed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of continuing coverage of several issues with the city of Richmond, the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/richmond-business-tax-finance-department-overpayment-refund-credit/article_f9d4edae-79e3-11ef-86d4-53caef1a3217.html?utm_source=richmond.com&amp;utm_campaign=breaking-news&amp;utm_medium=cio&amp;lctg=a2f10705c6e001b7f40a&amp;tn_email_eh1=875e038257cbb4f38a7302384230aa63140080cba4da0031789a69022d8423c6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported the finance department wasn’t notifying business owners that had overpaid on their tax bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asia Spratley, a former program and operations manager in the finance department, told an employee in an August 2022 email, “please do not include credit balanced,” when the employee asked how to determine the number of taxpayer accounts no longer had a balance due, according to the email obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of his report, journalist Samuel Parker detailed how Jason Roop, who owns the public and relations marketing firm Springstory, and Jeff Marks, who ran Promotional Considerations, received notices of unpaid taxes and the city’s intent to sue, respectively. It took a visit to city hall for Roop and Marks to learn of their accidental overpayments, and credits owed to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spratley told the RTD credit balances were omitted from reports because they were intended to determine who had outstanding balances. Overpayments were the responsibility of the “revenue side” of the department, added Spratley, who resigned in August after a dispute with management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margaret Ekam, a city spokeswoman, said Spratley’s instructions followed the “normal process” to write payment letters. Ekam also said most tax compliance and audit employees are no longer working with the finance department, which is “streamlining several processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city council passed an ordinance in March requiring notification of credits to taxpayers, but those records aren’t tracked, Ekam said. An inspector general said a city attorney told him to end an investigation into the finance department’s handling of tax overpayments because it was outside of his responsibilities. Ekam denied that, saying an investigation had cleared the city of wrongdoing, but didn’t state what agency carried out the investigation.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fairfax County teacher sues for lack of records </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Fairfax County school teacher and former state Senate candidate filed a lawsuit against the district employing her alleging a failure to hand over all of the documents she requested through a Freedom of Information Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie Perry, who teaches history at Centreville High School, filed the records request after she thought her job was under attack following a post on X involving alleged transgender autistic kids, the </span><a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/09/20/virginia-school-district-refuses-give-public-records-teacher-sabotaged-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily Signal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Perry posted about a trend she saw in her classrooms of autistic kids identifying as transgender, adding, “The far-left uses the literal mentality of children with Autism to abuse them in this manner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is why children with Autism need greater protection.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the post, Vanessa Hall, who was not co-director of Fairfax County’s LGBT Pride club at the time but now is, sent an email to the high school principal voicing concern over the post, according to records received through a request from a Daily Wire reporter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, these tweets below show that she is using students for her political gain,” Hall said in her complaint, adding she’s refrained from reporting Perry’s other “homophobic, transphobic and deeply hurtful” posts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She has crossed a serious ethical line if she is willing to release personal information about her students to the public on social media in direct violation of school policy and parental rights,” Hall said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Perry received a memo telling her that her posts, “should not impair your capacity” to be respectful of students and parents and the ability to do her job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any action that brings the school system into disrepute may be just cause for dismissal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry filed a FOIA request on May 29 for emails from Assistant Principal Penny Gros, who received a complaint about Perry and would seek guidance on how to handle it before the memo went out, mentioning her name. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gros received the complaint, the Daily Signal reported, from the principal at Perry’s high school initially who received it from a donor to the campaign of then school board member and now Sen. Stella Pekarsky, the Democrat who beat Perry to represent Fairfax County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perry only received one document in response to her FOIA, despite the Daily Wire receiving 14 documents for a similar request.</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story has been corrected to state Vanessa Hall was not co-director of Fairfax County’s LGBT Pride club when she emailed the high school principal.</em></p>

(Photo courtesy of Kenny Fletcher/Chesapeake Bay Foundation)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a reversal from a decision earlier this year, the Virginia Marine Resource Commission voted 4-1 Tuesday to have a public hearing on keeping the winter dredge crabbing season closed, but extend the pot catching season, two measures both the industry and one conservation group did not oppose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMRC board members A.J. Erskine, Will Bransom, Jeanette Edwards and Thomas Preston voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://www.mrc.virginia.gov/commission_briefing_packets/2024/2024-09-24-Briefing-Packet.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Spencer Headly voted against, with three other board members absent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMRC will come back in October to make a final decision on the proposals, after initially voting in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/26/virginia-votes-to-reopen-winter-crab-dredge-season/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to repeal the regulation that prohibited the winter dredge crabbing season. Crabbers sought the repeal to create a winter market to sell their catches at higher values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals acted on Tuesday were recommendations by the VMRC Crab Management Advisory Committee, or CMAC, which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/03/virginia-crab-management-committee-requests-opening-winter-season-for-dredging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommended to VMRC the reopening of the winter dredge season. But since the June decision, CMAC met twice with a discussion facilitator to examine data on the number of crabs in the Chesapeake Bay, and what the impact of a winter dredge crabbing season would be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change from the June decision, CMAC members told their VMRC colleagues this week, was a realization of a “conservation equivalency,” that having the winter season would force crabbers to catch less during the rest of the year in order to stay below conservation caps put in place across the Chesapeake Bay when crabs reached disastrously low levels in the early 2000s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of these crabbers are like, ‘hold on, I don’t want to give up my slice with my size of the pie to accommodate a fishery that I might or may or may not participate in,’” Ed Tankard said during Tuesday’s meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winter crab dredging is the act of using metal chains to catch crabs buried in the bottom of the seafloor to haul them in. A winter dredge survey is conducted to count the numbers of females that bury into the mud during the colder months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concern with a winter dredge catching season is that 90% of the catches are females, which are sought after to spawn new juvenile crabs. One issue with the species, Romuald Lipcius, a professor at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences, told VRMC, is that juvenile crabs aren’t living long enough, possibly because of predation from catfish or red drum, or eggs getting impacted when they end up on shorelines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia had a winter dredging season, but closed it in 2008 after the number of female crabs in the Bay plummeted from over 200 million in 1991 to about 50 million in 2002.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get those numbers back up, the three regulatory bodies within it, including VMRC, the Potomac River Fisheries Commission and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, all took a 34% cut in crab harvest. VRMC closed the winter dredge season to account for half of that reduction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The species since has only been allowed to be caught through traps, or “pots”, between March 17 and Nov. 30, except for a few years in which the season was extended by a couple weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of crabs in the Bay has spiked back up and down to about 250 million in 2017, but has been on a downward trend to just under 150 million this year with no need for additional conservation measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote in June had put the VMRC in a bit of a pickle, because it repealed the regulation putting in place the prohibition on winter crab dredging from Dec. 1 to March 31. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Virginia currently has no rules on winter catch limits, and the number of participants after the regular season ends on Dec. 16, following a previously approved extension. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a winter dredge crabbing season would require determining catch limits and participants in order to establish the conservation equivalency, as well as changes to license regulations, all of which may not have been created until Dec. 3. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising for a public hearing to keep the season closed this year came with an additional motion to have CMAC continue exploring the regulatory framework for future years, in order to allow a stock assessment expected to be finished in 2026 to not be altered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assessment was in 2011, even though others typically happen every three to five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More time allows staff to also figure out how to more easily open or close the winter season with that framework and understand what the full ramifications would be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One potential impact could be limiting the type of </span><a href="https://www.mrc.virginia.gov/Notices/2024/2024-09-24-VIMS-PC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equipment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be used in certain areas, and a brief ban on sponge crabs, which CMAC member Mark Sanford said wouldn’t impact him, but Nathan Reynolds said it would impact 90% of the crabbers on the Eastern Shore. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not trying to pin one thing against another person,” Reynolds added. “As we work to try to build that framework for the dredge fishery, we can extend the season.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">latter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">would allow crabbers to continue fishing beyond an extension already to work through Dec. 31 and begin again March 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar extension happened in 2016 to 2017, and represented roughly 1% of the annual catch. Warming water could mean the crabs have not been buried into the sea floor during those extension periods, said Pat Geer, VMRC’s chief of fisheries management. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Moore, of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an environmental group, said he understood the proposals had been recommended by the CMAC, but, “It’s not one of my favorites about this,  because I think you all set very good seasons based on the information I had available back in June.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMRC also faces opposition to winter crab dredging from other groups, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Chesapeake Bay Office Sustainable Fisheries Goal Implementation team,  and six online comments</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">— but none in support of opening the winter dredge season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crabbers way down the Bay have a much longer harvesting season than those who crab in the upper part of the bay, because of water temperature,” the Virginia Twin Rivers Waterman’s Association, which crabs at the end of the Rappahannock River and Potomac River, wrote in a letter to VMRC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to shorten the harvest season so crabs can recover some before they are potted heavy again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Be prepared,” said Bob Mauskapf, VDH director of the office of emergency preparedness, “for anything that you can think of that you would be without.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Health is part of the state’s Virginia Emergency Support Team, or VEST, responsible for monitoring health impacts from mold showing up in flooded homes, the transfer of diseases through mosquitoes that congregate near collections of water and resulting hospital surges, and more. The Virginia Department of Emergency Management spearheads the team, which includes several other state agencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, North America switched from its dryer El Niño season into a wetter La Niña one, which happens every two to seven years. The change prompted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to predict there could be an increase in damaging named storms this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millions of people were left without power in Texas this summer and at least three died after encountering Hurricane Beryl, the second, and perhaps most devasting, storm of this season. So far this year, Virginia has only issued a state of </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/august/name-1031553-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emergency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Tropical Storm Debby, the fourth storm of the season. Debby didn’t hit Virginia as hard as North Carolina, but preliminary findings confirmed </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/lwx/DebbyTornadoes" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tornado</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> touchdowns in Glendie and Willisville, where winds were estimated to have reached 90 and 100 miles per hour, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Debby) was a grazing blow to us,” said Mauskapf, adding the storm season that runs until Nov. 30 “has not come to fruition.” But Virginia’s “highest incidence of Tropical Storm Activity in the area is usually October and early November. We&#8217;re entering into, if you will, the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/weather/richmond-tropical-storm-gaston-shockoe-bottom-flooding/article_9462326e-64a4-11ef-8adf-db796acbf85c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">height</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Atlantic basin hurricane season,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Virginia braced for increased rain from </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/ilm/2024PTC8#:~:text=Potential%20Tropical%20Cyclone%20Eight%20was,from%20the%20warm%20ocean%20surface." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tropical Cyclone 8</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a storm that typically moves in a circular pattern, unlike a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/weather/richmond-tropical-storm-gaston-shockoe-bottom-flooding/article_9462326e-64a4-11ef-8adf-db796acbf85c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">derecho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that runs in a straight line across a region, Mauskapf explained. Rain left the state sooner than expected, but water levels on the James River at Sewell Point in the Norfolk area reached as high as 4.87 feet, over a foot above ground level, on the eve of Sept. 17. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winds as strong as 15 miles per hour from the northeast prevented water from receding, and so it lingered in that area. Weekend rain led to water levels in that same area rising over 5 feet Sunday night into Monday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prepare for the next bout of severe weather, the VDH is urging people to charge phones, keep backup power on hand, fill up gas tanks, safely store perishable food and, have a first aid kit. Sheltering options are available through one of VDH’s 35 local departments across the state and, in the event of emergencies, additional safe spaces are coordinated with universities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Corporation Commission, which oversees that state’s insurance, is also urging residents to maintain updated policies, which can include “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/virginia-officials-tout-preparedness-as-hurricane-season-begins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">essential</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” flood insurance to repair damage to homes as government assistance can lag and the threat of flooding is expected to continue. It’s a familiar danger in Virginia, in the short and long term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located on the East Coast, Norfolk experiences the fastest rate of sea level rise in the country at 5.38 millimeters a year, which  prompted the locality to propose a $2.6 million flood </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/26/norfolk-hits-obstacles-implementing-storm-risk-protection/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> project. The state’s Coastal Resilience Master </span><a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/crmp/document/VirginiaCoastalResilienceMasterPlan-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, due for an update at the end of this year, states “the number of residents living in homes exposed to major coastal flooding is projected to grow from approximately 360,000 to 943,000, an increase of 160%.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Southwest Virginia, the towns of Hurley and Whitewood  were pummeled with four to six inches of rain in 2021 and 2022, respectively, leading state emergency officials to explore ways of filling in gaps for post-storm </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Scientists have said what happened in those smaller localities is a result of climate change: intenser, more frequent storms. Officials are now challenged with how to deploy resources in the face of increasingly violent weather.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t deal in climate change or forecasting. We do deal in the results of climate change,” said Mauskapf.  “So we prepare our plans and our messaging, for these types of more frequent storms, higher temperatures, lower temperatures, whatever we may see. It&#8217;s the same threat.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Searching for a new vehicle can be challenging, but not as complex as it is to develop the infrastructure needed to power electric and low-emission vehicles at rest stops, gas stations, homes, workplaces and public areas in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build its EV infrastructure, the state leaned on the federal government’s nationwide plan to install charging stations across major corridors around the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, those areas are found along Interstates 81, 295 and 495, to name a few. The commonwealth has received $61 million, with a future allocation of $45 million, from the federal government’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to build out charging stations along interstate highways, with one planned at least every 50 miles, and within one mile of federally identified designated alternative fuel corridors (AFCs). So far, the process has progressed slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whenever you put a large amount of new money into a system, meaning deploying EV infrastructure where none previously existed, the startup is going to be very difficult. New processes and procedures need to be established to ensure taxpayer dollars are used appropriately and we minimize the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse,” said Del. David Reid, D-Loudoun, who is a strong supporter of electric vehicles and owns one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, homeowners, businesses, and residential and commercial developers could tap into another infrastructure layer soon — or even now, if they have access to a 240-volt outlet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state could incentivize Virginians to install chargers at shopping malls, homes and corporate offices through future legislation. Previous efforts have failed due to the lack of support or funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid said the state needs to build out the charging infrastructure along major highways, but there’s also the potential for existing wiring to support a Level 2 EV charger, which is typical for home, the workplace and public areas such as gas stations.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Divesting from gas stations for charging stations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s gas stations and convenience stores are aware of the transition to electric vehicles, but are generally prioritizing their available fossil fuel at the moment. Some, though, are seeing a new business opportunity with government funding to provide EV charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 30, the Department of Motor Vehicles said there were about 6.9 million vehicles registered in Virginia, with about 311,000 being electric, plug-in hybrid or traditional hybrid. That means at least 6.6 million cars need a gas station to fuel up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike O’Connor, president and CEO of the Virginia Petroleum and Convenience Marketers Association, acknowledged the transition to more electric vehicles is “going to happen regardless of what pressures are brought to bear because there are people that are interested in these vehicles.” O’Connor’s group represents owners or suppliers for the 3,385 gas stations and convenience stores across Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But given some challenges with adopting electric vehicles, including their difficulty performing in cold weather, O’Connor said for his group, the percentage of new cars sales being electric vehicles likely won’t increase beyond the current 7% rate as fast as previously thought. So they’re not focusing on EV drivers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If I&#8217;m one of these businesses, I&#8217;m doing a long term projection, and you say it&#8217;s going to increase by 100% in 10 years — which I think is optimistic given what&#8217;s going on — you&#8217;re going to go from 7% to 14%,” O’Connor said. “You&#8217;re still going to have 14% EVs and 86% internal combustion engines. If I’m making my efforts in planning, I&#8217;m focused on the 86% in those locations where I&#8217;m operating presently.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40119" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/deq-charger/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40119" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/deq-charger-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  EVgo chargers deployed by the Department of Environmental Quality at a gas station in Richmond. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That hold-out philosophy is present in the Shenandoah Valley, where Holtzman Oil is one of the largest suppliers of gas and is keeping with its model based on conversation with retailers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Our gut feeling is that fossil fuel has a long and bright future ahead of us,” said Todd Holtzman, general manager of the company&#8217;s propane division and a Republican member of the town of Mount Jackson’s council. “[Chargers] are very, very expensive and I think it&#8217;s a possibility when the public wants them. Where you see ‘em, I think they’re heavily subsidized and they’re not heavily used.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual gas station owners decide if and when to install EV chargers, O’Connor said, similar to the choice between selling “Coke versus Pepsi.” A separate group of gas stations and convenience stores, ranging from national chains to mom and pop stores that are a part of the Charge Ahead Partnership, ranging from national chains to mom and pop stores, take a fuel-agnostic stance, said Ryan McKinnon, a spokesman for the group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If customers want charging, they want to provide it,” McKinnon stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Level 3 fast chargers costing about $100,000 to install — the type which take about 15 to 20 minutes to charge a battery up to 85% for up to a 300 mile duration, typically — McKinnon said gas stations owners want certainty their investment will provide a return and not be overlooked by a charger built down the street. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That certainty, McKinnon said, can come from giving private companies a right of first refusal to prevent utilities from building, owning and profiting chargers paid for through ratepayer funds within a 12-mile radius of an existing publicly used one, which is what a 2024 </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb118" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, sought to achieve. Dominion Energy, which McKinnon said has been cooperative with building charging infrastructure, argued against the bill, saying it would have hampered their ability to provide more charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a pretty big business opportunity,” McKinnon said, adding gas stations can be well lit, attended by people and are close to highways. “We’re uniquely positioned.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The government’s role</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it can be considered as a subsidy, the government is providing incentives to overcome the funding concerns with building EV chargers, particularly at gas stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, a settlement with Volkswagen for cheating emission tests led to $14 million for charger development, primarily at gas stations in Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads area. More recently, the Virginia Department of Transportation began doling out National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funds from the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Belt, decarbonization program manager with the Virginia Department of Transportation, said the applicants include traditional gas stations and travel centers. The list of applicants also include third party operators running the stations, and those from the tourism industry operating dining establishments, grocery stores and shopping centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve seen pretty good, and I would say better than expected, response from applicants across the state,” said Chris Berg, director of sustainability at VDOT. “I think we had some concern around ‘are there some areas of the state that have lower EV penetration?’ where we may see less interest. But in our first round we saw multiple applications at all of our target areas.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38259" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1148px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/02/vdot-announces-sites-for-electric-vehicle-charging-stations/nevi-sites/" rel="attachment wp-att-38259"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38259" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites.png" alt="" width="1148" height="649" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites.png 1148w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites-300x170.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites-1024x579.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/NEVI-sites-768x434.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1148px) 100vw, 1148px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map of the sites chosen to receive federal funding for electric vehicle charging stations.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan told the Mercury in a phone interview he’s used a charging station much like what the NEVI program is working on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m in Western New York state right now. I drove up here in my EV,” Sullivan said “My wife and I stopped at a Sheetz in Bedford, Pennsylvania; took 20 minutes to charge our car while we were inside, using the restroom and buying some food for the road. And then we were on our way, not unlike an internal combustion engine vehicle stopping for a gas fill up.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">EV traveling in Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry leaders say charging stations along Virginia’s interstates are moving along, but have some challenges amid concerns over car batteries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, VDOT said after it received funding for the </span><a href="https://publicinput.com/Customer/File/Full/b483a081-9d89-4e33-874b-19ae8529c991" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NEVI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, it would be working through 2026 to expand the network to over 1,000 charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berg said it&#8217;s the largest investment in the commonwealth’s history. However, VDOT is uncertain when deployment could be completed, due to factors such as whether the program will be reauthorized and what the demand will be in a couple of years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply chain delays could also impact when award recipients complete the installation of charging stations, as could applicants’ need to ensure they understand the federal requirements and obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program does not cover infrastructure installation in areas beyond Virginia&#8217;s interstates, like the commonwealth’s rural regions. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, some communities are applying for the </span><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/charging-and-fueling-infrastructure-grant-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charging and Fuel Infrastructure Discretionary Grant Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to address those areas. The application process, which closed last month, offers a $2.5 million cut for groups such as local governments and planning organizations in urban and rural communities. The funding will help to deploy EV charging and other alternative vehicle-fueling infrastructure projects in publicly accessible locations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The idea behind the CFI funding is to essentially fill in gaps left by the NEVI program,” said Anne Blair, vice president of policy for the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit organization advocating for electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While NEVI dictates specific funding every 50 miles, a mile off the interstate, this is designed to really go in areas outside of that, [such as] rural communities (and neighborhoods with)multi-family housing, for instance, that also need assistance in terms of deployment of funding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s stated </span><a href="https://www.mwcog.org/file.aspx?&amp;A=8kzH4dtaFasiXH88W0qktEqlAIWJZ5eDj4%2Bc8Rd2uUI%3D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">goal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the charging network is to create a system that facilitates “convenient, reliable, and equitable access to fast charging stations throughout the commonwealth, while spurring growth in this promising industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan has introduced a bill three years and counting to make sure “all Virginians” can have access to charging, including rural areas that won’t directly benefit from the NEVI program. Sullivan’s bill attempted to offset some infrastructure costs in less populated, lower income areas, which Republican lawmakers have said is lacking while also largely opposing the clean cars policy seeking to increase the state’s adoption of electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those rural areas are where state parks typically are, too, said Sullivan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want all of our Virginia citizens to be able to charge electric vehicles. We want people coming into the states, into our beautiful tourist attractions all over the state. We want those people who own electric vehicles to feel confident that they can charge there as well.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid suggested that state involvement could help alleviate any inequities for people who live in places that don’t have garages or dedicated spaces for charging such as apartments and condominiums. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Operating and improving EV charging in Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some consumers considering the idea of transitioning to electric are looking to businesses, legislators and local and state governments to make finding charging stations easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some parts of Virginia, electric and low emission vehicle owners have already taken steps to install chargers at their homes. In some cases, a homeowner is required to have an electrical permit to install a charger. Experts say most EV charging is done at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.pwcva.gov/department/building-development-division/residential-EV-charging-stations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an electrical permit is required when a circuit or feeder is added or extended to supply the vehicle charging system or if the system is hard wired. A permit is not required if the charging system is cord-and-plug connected to an existing circuit that meets the requirements of the manufacturer’s installation instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV and hybrid owners also use chargers at shopping malls and at workplaces as the more effective charging stations become available.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers attempted to increase the number of charging stations and home chargers during the previous three sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Virginia legislature passed the first EV Rebate Program providing tax incentives for consumers to purchase a new or used electric vehicle. However, the program was never funded by the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reid said the state’s EV Rebate Program lost support because some interpreted it as a means to support the wealthy purchasing expensive EVs; others balked because of the cost to support the program. He said the commonwealth has a “finite amount of money,” and the legislature has to make some “very difficult decisions” about priorities, some of which have been neglected for decades, such as increasing teacher pay, disability waivers and law enforcement pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t fault anyone for that, but it was one of those unfortunate things that we were able to pass the legislation, but we had different priorities when we got to the budget,” Reid said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1312" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to give localities the option to require developers to include charging infrastructure in their proposals failed, which he said was supported by localities in Northern Virginia. A similar bill in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb405" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">would have convened a workgroup to evaluate the technical requirements for building EV charging infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said she supports localities having the flexibility “in certain areas” to require developers to include charging infrastructure in their proposals, especially multi-family dwelling unit construction proposals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to keep up with the times and with the technology and giving localities another tool in the toolbox to make some decisions for themselves, knowing their communities better than anybody else, I think it’s a reasonable thing,” Boysko said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blair from the coalition acknowledged that it’s been “a fairly controversial issue for the building community, because it&#8217;s another thing on their list to include in their standards.” But it&#8217;s “vastly less expensive to do it when you&#8217;re building a new apartment complex than to retrofit a property after it&#8217;s already been built,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without Boysko’s bill passing, the city of Alexandria has been using “Standard Conditions” to encourage developers to agree to include charging infrastructure as they submit building proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virtually all development projects incorporate some degree of EV infrastructure into their project,” said Amy Posner, EV planner for the city of Alexandria. “We typically see at least 2% of the parking spaces on a project will have Level 2 EV chargers. The latest update to the Standard Conditions raised that to 5% of parking spaces to better align with EV adoption rates in Alexandria.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40117" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/in-va-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-development-is-underway-incentives-could-spur-growth/img_4241/" rel="attachment wp-att-40117"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40117" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4241-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  An electric vehicle charger at a Richmond residence. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city also wants to provide the chargers in areas like city parks and libraries, but costs are a challenge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get around that, the city is offering up their locations to developers who would own, operate and profit from charging stations, but “ideally” enter a revenue sharing agreement with the city. Grants that Alexandria receives could also go toward building chargers. It’s similar to a program Virginia Beach is doing, Posner said, “to really accelerate the public charging that we know we need to make it easier for folks to make the switch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart Gardner, executive director of </span><a href="https://generation180.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generation 180</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides consumer education on switching to electric, said a way the organization is helping to spur interest is working with businesses in developing charging stations, and encouraging localities to apply for federal grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last January, Henrico County became the recipient of a </span><a href="https://henrico.gov/news/2024/01/henrico-earns-1-4-million-grant-to-create-ev-charging-station-network/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.4 million discretionary grant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the </span><a href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/charging-and-fueling-infrastructure-grant-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charging Fuel Infrastructure Grant Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for developing stations at seven county facilities including at two libraries and a recreational center. The second round of applications closed last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Generation 180 and a coalition of partners reached out to localities across the state to say ‘hey, let&#8217;s not leave money on the table.’ They’re going to award these grants, so let’s make sure that money is in Virginia,” Gardner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Virginians unable to charge at home, businesses like Dominion are making it possible at the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/27/dominions-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-program-has-zero-sign-ups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>The company also <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/save-energy/electric-vehicles/residential-charger-program" target="_blank">announced</a> last Thursday that it would provide a one stop shop for qualifying residents who want to add chargers at home by connecting them with electricians. Participants can pay $1,835.96 upfront for the charger plus required materials, permitting, installation, maintenance and support, or pay $40.27 a month for five years. Low-income participants, including a family of four making less than $88,000 a year, can also participate at no cost. The utility will provide ongoing support, including a five year warranty.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This program eliminates a significant barrier to EV ownership by simplifying the process to purchase and install a home charger,&#8221; said Nathan Frost, General Manager of New Business &amp; Customer Solutions for Dominion Energy. &#8220;We are excited to help empower our customers to reduce their fuel costs and their emissions at the same time.&#8221;</span></p>

(Courtesy of Evan Visconti)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new program that scientists have sought to make Chesapeake Bay clean up more effective is now underway in Virginia, following a budget allocation from the legislature this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known as the Pay-for-Outcomes grant </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/topics-of-interest/nps-pilot-program?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is accepting applications until Feb. 3 for the $20 million that is available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not reimbursing people for efforts, we’re only paying for outcomes,” said Jonathan Rak, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief policy advisor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at DEQ, which administers a wide range of water quality programs. “We’re really excited about that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is part of the Chesapeake Bay Program, a collection of the six states that are home to the waters of the 64,000 mile watershed feeding into The Bay, the nation’s largest estuary, which remains polluted after decades of efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay program has pledged to clean up the Bay by reducing nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment erosion entering waterways, primarily through adoption of storm and wastewater treatment facility upgrades and agricultural best management practices, called Ag BMPs. Those efforts reduce waste or rainwater runoff that carry nutrients into rivers and streams. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Bay Program is behind on meeting deadlines for 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As several organizations, including the Chesapeake Bay Commission, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and state, environmental, local and farming groups discuss what the new goals should be and how to achieve them, the Pay-for-Outcomes program has gained attention as a way to get the most bang for a cleanups’ buck. Maryland adopted a program last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“New financial incentive programs such as pay-for-performance or pay-for-success programs,”  wrote the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee of the Bay program in a Comprehensive Evaluation of System Response 2023 </span><a href="https://www.chesapeake.org/stac/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/CESR-Executive-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “offer opportunities … to encourage adoption of highly effective practices that land managers may not consider under standard cost-share programs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay Program has counted progress toward cleanup goals by relying on modeling from the adoption of the Ag BMPs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has recently pumped record amounts of funding into a cost-share program to help with installing those BMPs, which include streamline fences to keep animals from defecating in waterways, or buffers to catch fertilizer before it trickles into streams and creaks, participation hasn’t been at desired levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Ag BMP modeling is backed by scientific calculations, there isn’t a full verification to guarantee water quality is improving after a practice is installed. The Pay-for-Outcomes program is seen as a way to ensure actual results, while also exploring new technologies that can offer a targeted approach, said Joe Wood, a senior scientist with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an environmental group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of a new technology is a bioreactor, which is essentially a wood chip pile that filters spring water through it. Monitoring water between the spring and the reactor, and then past the reactor, can show how effective the technology is and if certain springs are releasing levels of pollution into waterways at higher rates than others, Wood explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In parts of the Shenandoah Valley, which have higher rates of nitrogen loads from a wide range of sources, including agricultural land that can also release varying amounts of nutrients in different sections, the Pay-for-Outcomes program can incentivize the use of the reactors to hone in on where work is needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That kind of fine scale is really key to making our programs efficient,” said Wood. “If something like 10% of the land accounts for 50% of the loads, and if you go work in the areas that are low loading, you might never really get to address the key places.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Riddell of the Virginia Cattlemen&#8217;s Association, which represents thousands of cattle producers across the commonwealth, said he wasn’t sure what the level of interest in the program among farmers would be, but that it is an “opportunity” to go along with the Ag BMP cost-share program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see this as additional supplemental money that will be directed toward nonpoint pollution,” Riddell said. “It’ll be interesting to see who and what the applicants are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is wide open to municipalities, farmers, environmental groups and for-profit groups within the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which in Virginia includes the James River and areas north of it, for awards of up to $100,000 to $7 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applicants can be groupings of projects, which eases the amount of review work the DEQ must do, Rak said, and most show they achieve pollution reductions beyond what is already required under statute and regulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals will first be reviewed by a technical committee consisting of professors from Virginia Tech and the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences chosen by DEQ Director Mike Rolband, that will determine a “confidence interval” for how likely the project will reach success since some of the proposed methods will be novel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, a selection committee with members of the DEQ and the Department of Conservation and Recreation will choose participants based on a scoring criteria, largely looking at the cost effectiveness of the program. Also, along with the confidence interval, proposals will be selected based on “habitat and resilience benefits, readiness to proceed, local government coordination, the provision of long-term maintenance and applicability to locally impaired waters,” states the budget </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2024/1/HB30/Introduced/MR/365/3h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposed by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applicants will have up to five years to achieve their results, which must be presented through monitoring or known modeling calculations, like for buffers. Then, payment will be delivered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There likely will be projects that fail,” said Rak. “That’s the nature of a pilot program. But we’re going to learn from that.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking to a crowd in Richmond on April 8, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has joined a group of nine other Republican governors who are advocating for “energy choice,” intending to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimize permitting and other regulatory barriers” and “limit expensive energy mandates,” among other goals. Some clean energy advocates said the term is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a euphemism for the continued use of natural gas that pollutes the planet and drives climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Called the Governors’ Coalition for Energy Choice, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu announced the group in a press release </span><a href="https://gov.louisiana.gov/news/4637" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin&#8217;s press secretary, Christian Martinez, said the governor has &#8220;consistently called&#8221; for measures the group wants since releasing his energy plan that seeks &#8220;access to a reliable, affordable, increasingly clean, and growing supply of power.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The governor is encouraged by the broad support of Republican governors across the country leading the way, urging federal leaders to follow suit,&#8221; said Martinez.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coalition includes Govs. Brian Kemp, of Georgia; Bill Lee, of Tennessee; Eric Holcomb, of Indiana; Mark Gordon, of Wyoming; Sarah Huckabee Sanders, of Arkansas; Kristi Noem of South Dakota; and Kevin Stitt, of Oklahoma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid “high costs of energy and accelerating energy cost inflation,” the group highlights a need for energy policy that is “focused on affordability, reliability, and good stewardship” to “foster economic opportunity and improve the lives of their citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has touted similar messaging by advocating for his “All-of-the-Above” energy </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/19/youngkin-speaks-about-energy-plan-ahead-of-update-in-coming-weeks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which calls for continued natural gas usage, a re-evaluation of the Virginia Clean Economy Act — a 2020 landmark law that aims to decarbonize the state’s electric grid by 2050 — and using nuclear energy to provide reliable power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Kemp also joined other Republican leaders in Louisiana in </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/06/03/republican-governors-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to attack President Joe Biden’s climate policies, which are </span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-acts-benefits-and-costs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to prevent 21 billion tons of emissions and $5.6 trillion in environmental damages by investing in renewable energy technologies like solar, battery storage, offshore wind and nuclear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Energy Information Agency, a federal government entity, said in its latest </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the costs for natural gas electricity generation sources entering service in 2027 is expected to be $39.94 per megawatt generated over the span of an hour. For solar, the rate is $33.83 per megawatt hour, $105.38 for offshore wind and $128.55 for battery storage, and $81.71 for nuclear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the need for electricity around the country and in Virginia is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to skyrocket in coming years due to data center development, electrification of vehicles and increased use of technology, calling into question whether renewables can reliably provide enough power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its outlook, the EIA also projected that solar would be able to generate 28% of the energy it is capable of, what is known as a capacity factor, while natural gas has a capacity factor of 87%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But tools are available to alleviate the shortfall of renewable energy’s production by getting it on the grid faster, which will also decrease reliance on fossil fuels that are </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/methane-tracker-2021/methane-and-climate-change" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exacerbating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> climate change, said Walton Shepherd, Virginia policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those tools include the recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rule 1920 to better coordinate transmission planning; technologies available to upgrade existing transmission lines; reforms underway to speed up approvals at PJM Interconnection, the regional grid Virginia is a member of; and savings created through energy efficiency by using less electricity in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All of those solutions are there, readily at hand for Governor Youngkin to help everyone who’s working on this,&#8221; said Shepherd. “For Youngkin to stick his head in the sand and side with fossil fuel interests is something that will raise costs, not lower them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the costs of renewable energy, which comes with the benefit of avoiding health issues, will  only improve, said Tim Cywinski, communications director for the Virginia Chapter of the Sierra Club, by not relying on a volatile market like natural gas does, and by avoiding fossil fuel delivery fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The more we put on the grid the cheaper it will become,” Cywinski said.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recreational fishers in Virginia are asking legislators to take action on managing menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay, as the only reduction fishing company catching the tiny nutrient fish continues to refute allegations it’s harming the species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Sept. 3 </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/menhaden-letter.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Association sent the request to all 100 members of the House of Delegates and 40 members of the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and it can no longer support this level of industrial-scale fishing in its fragile waters,” wrote Steve Atkinson, chairman of the VSSA, after detailing ways management of menhaden has and hasn’t changed in recent years. “Our citizens ask for your support of sensible regulatory/legislative action to better manage this vital public resource.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oversight of the menhaden reduction fishery in Virginia has long been debated through regulation requests and ongoing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/29/virginia-ag-asks-for-dismissal-of-suit-over-menhaden-fishing-in-the-chesapeake-bay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">court</span></a> <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/16/defendants-seek-dismissal-of-lawsuit-alleging-fraudulent-ownership-scheme-of-omega-protein/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that sought to reduce the catch amounts for Reedville-based Omega Protein, the lone reduction fishery in the Bay that reduces menhaden into fishmeal and oil.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VSSA and conservationists say Omega’s catches are hurting the striped-bass population, though the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, the regional fishing management authority, says the species is </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-researchers-find-low-number-of-juvenile-striped-bass-in-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overfished</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but overfishing is not occurring. Overfished is a regulatory term meaning that the number of fish or weight of fish is below a sustainable reference point, while overfishing happens when catching or death rates are below a sustainable reference point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakebaymagazine.com/study-links-menhaden-depletion-to-osprey-chicks-starving-in-nests/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now linking lower populations of menhaden to starving osprey chicksin several areas of the Bay, not just the lower Mobjack Bay region that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/03/local-audubon-society-asks-va-regulators-to-suspend-use-of-fishing-nets-in-bay-over-osprey-worries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research examined. Over the summer, the USGS presented to the ASMFC separate </span><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eesc/science/osprey-pandion-haliaetus-population-and-availability-menhaden-brevoortia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also looking at how catching menhaden, as well as pollution and weather events, could be starving the osprey species amid competition with other birds, including the double crested cormorant and brown pelicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the Virginia legislature transferred regulatory oversight to the Virginia Marine Resources Commission, where the VSSA and conservations thought stricter rules on Omega would be easier to attain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a 2022 petition with 11,000 signatures calling for Omega to move its fishing to the Atlantic Ocean in order to study the impact of the company on the Bay led to the VMRC entering into a non-binding </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/07/virginia-regulators-enter-into-agreement-with-menhaden-fishery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">memorandum of understanding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the company, which agreed to not fish around holidays and weekends. Another </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/24/latest-petition-to-reduce-omega-proteins-menhaden-catch-limit-is-rejected/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for stricter regulations on Omega was denied earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omega, which is limited to a 51,000 metric ton cap on catches in the Bay under ASMFC’s direction, has said that fishing in the Bay is critical when inclement weather makes fishing in the Atlantic Ocean unsafe. There also isn’t any science showing their operations — which employ over 250 people with annual wages totaling $29 million, $26 million of which stays in Northumberland and Lancaster counties — aren’t as impactful on birds in the Bay as “a range of issues” that the USGS presented are, contends the company that operates Omega’s fishing vessels, Ocean Harvesters..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ocean Harvesters believes that any organization can and should participate in the governing process, but the groups’ statements must be grounded in facts and the best available science; not erroneous rhetoric that is meant to misinform like that of VSSA,” said Ocean Harvesters in a statement, adding such rhetoric could “negatively impact the blue-collar, union, and minority workforce of Ocean Harvesters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter from the VSSA references a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/31/house-committee-delays-action-on-study-of-menhaden-in-chesapeake-bay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from this past session carried by Del. Lee Ware, R-Powatan, that would’ve funded the $2.6 million study both the recreational fishers and Omega have called for, but the measure was carried over to next year’s session. The recreational fishers, Omega, academic institutions and conservations crafted the framework of the study, to be conducted by the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts to reach Ware weren’t immediately successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, who is a member of the study’s subcommittee that voted to carry over Ware’s bill and several other funding requests said in a statement, “I and many of my colleagues remain supportive of it and interested in (the menhaden study’s) crucial findings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I look forward to continuing to work on this issue in the coming Session and am hopeful that we can secure the funding and resources,” Carr said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the USGS presentation over the summer, the ASMFC </span><a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/chesapeake-bay-activities/news/atlantic-states-marine-fisheries-commission-asmfc-vote" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a motion from Lynn Fegley, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources director of fishing and boat services, to form a workgroup to consider “precautionary options,” including seasonal closures, for regulations on Omega. Virginia’s representative on the board, Pat Geer, chief of fisheries management at VMRC, attempted to postpone the measure to gather the science first, but his motion failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Fegley’s] motion is leading down a path of the seasonal closure for a fishery based on public opinion,” said Pat Geer, VMRC Chief of Fisheries. “We need the science first. We need to have that information. It is very frustrating for us, and it&#8217;s embarrassing, that we can&#8217;t get the funding to do this, if it&#8217;s that important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ASMFC workgroup is expected to present  proposals in October. Any regulation changes to Omega need </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> happen between October and December, the time period negotiated as part of the oversight transfer to VMRC to allow the company to prepare for the season that begins in May.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s largest producer of natural gas is expanding its regional headquarters in the Southwest region of the state. Natural gas can be derived from coal bed methane, a potent greenhouse gas driving climate change which, in Virginia, is emitted through mining in the state’s coalfields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, CNX Resources held a ribbon cutting to celebrate moving its regional headquarters from Claypool Hill in Tazewell County a few miles north to the Richlands Professional Building in the town of Richlands within the same county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CNX brings to life our vision for an all-American, all-of-the-above approach to fueling Virginia’s unprecedented economic growth and energy needs, leveraging Southwest Virginia’s rich coal mines to produce abundant, affordable, and lower emissions natural gas,” Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said, referencing his energy </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/19/youngkin-speaks-about-energy-plan-ahead-of-update-in-coming-weeks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that calls for continued use of natural gas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move, announced in </span><a href="https://www.vceda.us/cnx-resources-celebrates-groundbreaking-for-new-virginia-headquarters-office/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was made possible with a $900,000 loan from the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Authority, a regional authority the Virginia legislature created in 1988 to diversify the economy in the state’s 13 coal-producing counties in the region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds for the loan come from a severance tax Tazewell county assessed on coal and natural gas companies, explained Youngkin’s press secretary Christian Martinez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loan will go to the Tazewell County Industrial Development Authority, which will use $500,000 to purchase about 121 acres of CNX Resources property near Tazewell High School. The IDA will also give the remaining $400,000 to CNX Resources to pay for upgrades to the Richlands Professional Building, where CNX Resources has entered into a 15-year lease.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expansion will house 75 employees and bring on eight new ones, while also increasing the Richland’s Professional Building square footage by 85%. The loan must be repaid within five years, but the $400,000 is forgivable if CNX Resources employs at least 75 employees full-time  with an average annual salary of $100,000 by the fifth anniversary of the loan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jonathan Belcher, executive director of the VCEDA, said in a statement the authority was “pleased” to work with a “great” company that demonstrates why the region is “such a great place to do business and expand.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNX Resources, headquartered in Pittsburgh with operations also in Ohio, West Virginia and across the counties of Buchanan, Russell and Tazewell in Virginia, produces natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shales of Appalachia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which operates in Virginia as Pocahontas Gas, produced around 52% of all natural gas in the state in 2023, mostly in Buchanan County, Virginia Energy spokeswoman Tarah Kesterson stated. Natural gas across the state that year had an estimated value of $217 million and accounted for 54% of in-state electricity generation, she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The year prior, in 2022, about 83% of that natural gas came from coal beds through the extraction of methane from coal, a process known as coalbed methane, or CBM, according to the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/print.php?sid=VA#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20about%2083%25%20of,nation's%20total%20coalbed%20methane%20production." target="_blank">Energy Information Administration</a>. Those levels accounted for 10% of the county’s coal-bed methane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Methane is 25 times stronger than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere, and can also come in the form of coal mine methane, or CMM, produced by mining operations releasing it as a safety measure to prevent explosions during underground digging for coal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Aiello is a spokesperson for CNX Resources, which was part of a 2023 state workgroup that suggested Virginia could create </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/new-report-says-virginia-could-incentivize-methane-capture-from-coal-mines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incentives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for CMM capture to stimulate economic activity and reduce emissions that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere.  The headquarters’ move “signifies our commitment to the region and aligns with our ongoing efforts to drive economic progress while reducing emissions in the Commonwealth,” Aiello stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the topic of CMM incentives, Aiello said the company was “pleased that efforts at both the state and federal level to encourage the capture and beneficial use of coal mine methane continue to move forward,” adding that such projects are  “an environmental and economic win-win for the region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia received funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency over the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/01/federal-government-awards-150-million-to-reduce-emissions-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summer </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to capture coal mine methane. Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell, introduced a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?251+sum+SB562" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this past session that would have allowed CMM to count as a renewable energy source, but it got carried over to the 2025 session amid concern that it wouldn’t be a clean energy source and could continue incentivizing methane. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The International Panel on Climate Change, which links human created emissions to climate change, said that one ton of methane has a </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/methane-tracker-2021/methane-and-climate-change" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">planet warming potential</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over a 100-year time frame that is equal to 28 to 36 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Scientists have long linked climate change with increased severe weather events but the extent of its impact is unknown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the commonwealth’s transition to electric vehicles, dealerships and private companies have been grappling with meeting sales targets, and the costs to convert fleets and install infrastructure, as one major auto retailer with a plant in Southwest Virginia manufactures the parts necessary for electric heavy trucks to hit the road here and across America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of June 30, the Department of Motor Vehicles reports there were about 6.9 million vehicles registered in Virginia, about 1.7 million cars short of having one for every person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear how many of those cars are registered by private citizens or part of private companies’ fleets, but they contribute 37% of the state’s emissions from the transportation sector, almost double the next leading sources of Virginia’s 122 million metric tons of climate changing pollutants, according to a climate reduction </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/22732/638451476222270000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. The plan lists vehicle electrification as its number one solution to the problem..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reducing those carbon emissions by using more electric vehicles is better for the environment, would provide opportunities and spur new jobs, said Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Loudoun, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that if we don&#8217;t take necessary steps to reduce carbon emissions, and we know that transportation is the largest contributor to that, that we&#8217;re really going to be in very serious trouble,” Boysko said. “We should be thinking forward instead of trying to find ways of getting out of taking action.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration celebrated the </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/august/name-1032230-en.html#:~:text=RICHMOND%2C%20VA%20%E2%80%94%20Governor%20Glenn%20Youngkin,the%20City%20of%20Danville%20and" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expansion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of RBW Sports &amp; Classics to Virginia, placing another electric vehicle manufacturer in the commonwealth next to Volvo, which operates a factory in Dublin. But the governor also pledged to sever Virginia’s tie to California’s electric vehicle standards, and his administration said in a statement that electric vehicles may not be a one-size-fits-all solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Electric vehicles are and will continue to be an attractive option for some drivers and businesses, but they simply won’t work for all Virginians,” said Christian Martinez, a spokesman for the governor. Youngkin’s move to “declare independence from the California Electric vehicle mandate restores Virginians’ freedom to decide which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses and rids the commonwealth from a misguided mandate imposed by unelected bureaucrats.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Clean Cars and legislative efforts</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the controversial “Clean Cars” transition rules broadly require that 100% of new vehicle sales be electric starting in 2035, the regulations are nuanced and allow for hybrid-type vehicles that run on gas, and sales in other states, to be credited toward meeting the targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia had been following the Advanced Clean Car I standards out of California under authority granted in the federal Clean Air Act. Those standards required about 7% of new vehicle sales in 2024 to be electric, before California passed the updated Advanced Clean Car II standards, which imposed the 100% electric sales requirement. The ACC II standards </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">start with 35% of new sales required to be electric or plug-in hybrid beginning in 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new mandate under the ACC II standards is what led </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/youngkin-says-virginia-wont-follow-californias-clean-car-standards-anymore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to say Virginia will revert back to following the less-stringent federal standards next year, with the backing of Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares, who said the 2021 law tying the state’s tailpipe regulation to California’s didn’t mean the state had to follow the updated standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Miyares have advocated for consumer choice, and so has Will Hupman, vice president of American Petroleum Institute that represents the oil and gas industry, in </span><a href="https://www.api.org/-/media/files/news/letters-comments/2024/api_comments_epa_acc_ii_final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> submitted to the U.S. The Environmental Protection Agency, which is still considering </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/26/2023-28301/california-state-motor-vehicle-pollution-control-standards-advanced-clean-cars-ii-regulations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the exemption allowing California to set its own rules under the Clean Air Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 100% (zero emission vehicle)mandate for new vehicles plainly will have a significantly adverse effect on the nationwide market for liquid transportation fuels produced and marketed by API members and ignores other approaches that can result in similar emissions reductions, on a faster timeline, and at a lower cost,” Hupman wrote.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40024" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4135/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40024" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_4135-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A plug-in hybrid vehicle charges in Richmond. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups like the Southern Environmental Law Center, however, point to the standards’ flexibility that allow for compliance, like allowing credits from sales to be transferred among manufacturers. Credits from sales in other states, including manufacturers in California who “continue to over comply” with meeting requirements, according to the state’s online </span><a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/applications/annual-zev-credits-disclosure-dashboard" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dashboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can also count toward sales requirements in Virginia, should the state fall behind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also an option of allowing plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to account for 20% of a requirement. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or PHEVs, run on gas but also can charge their battery with a plug, while a traditional hybrid uses its engine to charge its battery while the car is running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV sales have slowed from their earlier accelerated pace, leading to concerns about meeting future Clean Car requirements.  But the SELC contends adoption of the ACC II standards that include sales requirements will lead manufacturers to send more EVs to the state to continue development of the market. Because the rules offer flexibility in how its requirements are met, the group also said, that concern isn’t warranted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No manufacturer has ever failed to meet the requirements of the Clean Car Standards on the present side of things,” said Carroll Courtenay, a staff attorney with the SELC. “There&#8217;s a lot of play in the joints and a lot of flexibility in terms of how manufacturers kind of plan nationally to meet the standards across the various states where they&#8217;re in place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmaker Boysko acknowledged a concern she’s heard from some Virginians is that the commonwealth hasn’t done enough to spur the adoption of electric vehicles for consumers and create incentives for businesses to build the infrastructure for charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the challenges that I hear from consumers, and I&#8217;m one of those, is that I want to be able to drive wherever I need to go in the commonwealth, and I&#8217;m not confident at this point to be able to do that because we have not done the work that my legislation set out to,(to) make a very clear effort that we are moving an electrified transportation system direction,” said Boysko.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dealers juggle EV demand and regulations</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the updated rules, dealers in Virginia have either embraced the sales targets or been met with sales and supply challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is selling between 4-5 electric vehicles per month, according to Tim Pohanka, Chief Operating Officer for the Pohanka Automotive Group and Legislative Chairman for the Virginia Automobile Dealers Association.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said electric cars made up around 8% of all car sales across the country in 2023, in part due to some states helping consumers pay for cars through subsidies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the DMV, electric, traditional hybrids and plug-in hybrid vehicles made up about 1%, 3% and .001% of registered vehicles in the state as of June 30 this year, respectively. The about 311,199 total registrations of those vehicle types have contributed about $75.5 million toward the controversial </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/investigative/charged-for-efficiency-the-highway-use-fee-debate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highway use fee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drivers must pay to make up for lost gas tax revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as hybrids, another form of low emission vehicles, continue to sell quickly, Pohanka said one of the chief challenges for dealers is some customers’ hesitancy to buy EVs because of factors like the cost, lack of charging infrastructure and anxiety with how far EVs can travel on a charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it&#8217;s safe to say that the dealer body in this country is ready to go on anything that the consumer wants,” Pohanka said. “It really comes down to how that demand gets generated, and right now we just don&#8217;t see any of that demand.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_24934" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2458px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-auto-dealers-say-they-will-support-new-vehicle-emissions-standards/img_5259-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-24934"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-24934 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2.jpg" alt="" width="2458" height="1481" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2.jpg 2458w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-300x181.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-1024x617.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-768x463.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-1536x925.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-2048x1234.jpg 2048w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-696x419.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-1068x643.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-697x420.jpg 697w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/IMG_5259-2-1920x1157.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2458px) 100vw, 2458px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Electric vehicle charging stations. (Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind the scenes, Pohanka said dealers across the country are building the infrastructure for the charging stations, investing in safety equipment for staff, educating consumers and training sales professionals and technicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pohanka said there is a misconception that dealers are against electric vehicles. In reality, he said, dealers are allowing consumers to pick what suits them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When a consumer comes in and they&#8217;ve got questions about any type of drive train, be it (internal combustion engine), be it hybrid, be it electric, we&#8217;re showing all of those technologies to a consumer so they can make the right choice themselves,” he said. “There&#8217;s no pushing one way or pushing another. You really want the customer’s needs to be in charge of their purchase.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the country’s goals to convert gas powered vehicles to electric, or low emission, Pohanka predicts no state will be able to meet the California regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;re not going to be able to go from 8% market share to 25% market share overnight. You&#8217;re going to need considerable help to get to those numbers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is some optimism about future EV sales, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart Gardner, executive director of </span><a href="https://generation180.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generation 180</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides consumer education on switching to electric, is confident vehicles will continue to sell. Generation 180 also found that women are underrepresented when it comes to EV ownership, representing  less than 30% of EV owners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re still seeing people shopping for electric vehicles, and people buying more and more electric vehicles every year in Virginia. So that&#8217;s still happening,” Gardner said. “Even though state media and national media is focusing on ‘oh, the sales are dropping,’ they&#8217;re still beating records, it&#8217;s just not growing as fast as it was and that&#8217;s the natural evolution of anything that sells. As it starts to move more mainstream that kind of adoption curve flattens out.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Converting fleets</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JK Moving Services, which is headquartered in Northern Virginia, has been preparing for the transition  enthusiastically, but still faces challenges like many other businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chuck Kuhn CEO and founder Chuck Kuhn said over the years the company has committed to sustainability. They use waste oil for furnaces and warehouse operations, provide sales members incentives to use electric vehicles and have converted all of its buildings to using motion sensors with LED lighting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JK’s truck drivers also use small, environmentally friendly generators when on the road instead of running diesel trucks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m passionate about protecting the environment, and it&#8217;s truly embraced in all aspects of how we run the business,” said Kuhn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shortage of electric trucks is one of the businesses’ key challenges, Kuhn said, especially after he invested and placed orders for Tesla’s electric vehicles years ago, which he has yet to receive. While he is still committed to converting the company’s fleet to electric, Kuhn admitted he was discouraged after learning that PepsiCo received less than half of the vehicles promised by the manufacturer, according to an April report by </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-semi-trucks-short-supply-pepsico-its-rivals-use-competing-ev-big-rigs-2024-04-19/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said he believed Tesla to be in the best position to bring electric heavy duty trucks to the market. He ordered six local tractors, but has been waiting four years after paying a deposit. The goal is to convert the entire tractor fleet by purchasing 12 units total. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would have thought by now a large portion of our local fleet would have been converted to electric,” Kuhn said. “I had no idea it was going to take this long to get them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelley Francis, co-founder and managing partner of EVNoire, a consulting company that focuses on autonomous mobility solutions, said some of the reasons businesses are converting their fleets to electric vehicles is because of the cost of maintaining a gas powered vehicle. Francis said electric vehicles have limited maintenance costs for tires, windshield wipers and fluids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to JK Moving Services, Francis said their clients are also converting their fleets to meet their sustainability goals such as reducing their carbon footprint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuhn said some other challenges he anticipates once his EV trucks arrive is the need to outsource maintenance support for the trucks until he can train his mechanics, preparing for the lack of infrastructure across the country and limitations on how many miles a truck can travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s easy to sit back and say, ‘no, that won&#8217;t work,’ ‘we can&#8217;t do it,’ and then you don&#8217;t change, and I&#8217;m a firm believer: if you don&#8217;t embrace change, you&#8217;re going to be left behind,” Kuhn said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Heavy truck industry opposes regulations</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some businesses are working to convert its fleet of heavy trucks, others are in opposition to federal rules calling for the transition due to the mandates and costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Trucking Association, which said there were 43,338 heavy and tractor trailer truck </span><a href="https://vatrucking.wildapricot.org/resources/ATRI_FastFacts_2024_VA.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drivers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia in 2022, said there’s been a 98% reduction of nitrous oxide emissions coming from the trucking industry’s tailpipes since 1985.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heavy trucks in Virginia follow rules from the federal government, which finalized an update in March that, similar to the passenger car rules, calls for truck drivers to use cleaner gas engines, traditional and plug-in hybrids, and battery electric and hydrogen fuel cell type vehicles for model years 2027 through 2032. Several groups are challenging the rules, which could delay their implementation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EPA </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-strongest-ever-greenhouse-gas-standards-heavy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the rules will remove one billion tons of climate-changing emissions from the 25% of emissions heavy trucks contribute to the transportation sector’s total emissions. The rules could also save the country $13 billion in avoided health costs, fuel and operation benefits.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40022" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_3983/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-40022" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3983-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="2137" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3983-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3983-300x250.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3983-1024x855.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3983-768x641.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3983-1536x1282.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_3983-2048x1710.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A heavy truck drives on Interstate 64 past the Goochland Safety Rest Area East. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council said the rules didn’t actually go far </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/guillermo-ortiz/epas-latest-heavy-duty-vehicle-rule-does-not-meet-moment" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dale Bennett, president and CEO of the Virginia Trucking Association, said the rules had “picked the technology” by pushing toward electric vehicle adoption, which the industry says will cost </span><a href="https://www.trucking.org/news-insights/ev-mandates-trucking-industry-are-disconnected-reality" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 trillion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in purchases, and require building charging infrastructure and upgrading power supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That price tag will force drivers to either hold on to their trucks or hurry to purchase trucks now, which aren’t up to the EPA’s Clean Car standards, Bennett said. Higher costs will also trickle down to raise the costs of transported goods, and with the lack of heavy truck charging, which works differently than passenger vehicle charging, there’s what’s called “range anxiety” over how long a change will last and concern over an EV trucks’ towing ability, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">here&#8217;s that money going to come from?” said Bennett. “It will require more trucks to haul the same amount of freight we&#8217;re hauling. We’ve got to figure that out. We think there are other technologies and ways to get there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo Group, which runs the 2.3 million-square-foot New River Valley Operations electric heavy trucks manufacturing plant in Dublin, a town within Virginia’s Pulaski County,  sees things differently. The company is “c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ompletely aligned” with the EPA’s desire of “speeding the transition to zero-emission vehicles,” said Volvo Group North America Public Relations Director Janie Coley. They also have other emissions-reducing ideas for the commonwealth and other localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Along with electrification, states can realize significant reductions through greater use of renewable, lower carbon fuels, like HVO (renewable diesel),” Coley said, adding the plant uses HVO to move finished vehicles off the plant’s production line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, there are 560 </span><a href="https://www.volvotrucks.us/trucks/vnr-electric/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volvo VNR Electric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trucks, which make up 44% of the Class 8 battery electric heavy trucks, the heaviest class, in the country, said Bobby Compton, product market manager at Volvo Trucks North America. Those vehicles have driven over 7.8 million miles since being launched in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local carriers, including Camrett Logistics, Watsontown and Online Transportation, are using the model on daily routes in and out of the facility, transporting parts on two shifts while drivers charge them up on their lunch break, Compton said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the model has more towing power, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The Volvo VNR Electric features 4,051 lb./ft of torque, which is substantially higher than the 1,850 lb./ft of torque on a traditional internal combustion engine VNR.” </span></p>

(Courtesy of Volvo Group North America)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coley admitted that zero-emissions trucks including the VNR Electric have a higher production cost, resulting in a higher purchase price for customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is why we’ve seen the greatest rate of adoption of the VNR Electric in states and Canadian provinces where there are incentive and grant programs to offset some of the cost of purchase for customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company takes a “consultative approach” with customers to evaluate their operations, see if they fixed or planned routes, work to find incentives and offer financing options, including for charging infrastructure, Compton added.</span></p>

(VCU Capital News Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state&#8217;s second largest utility serving a majority of Southwest Virginia is asking state regulators for a 70% reduction in the pay rate for customers who generate their own electricity and sell excess amounts back to the company. The request could stifle residential customers’ adoption of solar in the region, proponents of the zero-carbon energy source say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power Company submitted the </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/815r01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the State Corporation Commission Aug. 30 as part of a new rulemaking process required by the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a law seeking to decarbonize the utility’s grid by 2045. The process governs the program known as net-metering, which took off in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net-metering allows residents and companies to install generation sources on their roof or property to provide the electricity they would otherwise need to pull from the utility’s grid. In APCo’s territory, those generation sources have mostly been solar panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The homes and businesses sell back to the company whatever amount of electricity they generate beyond what they need, and net that revenue against their costs for energy they may pull from the utility when their source isn’t producing, resulting in savings or credits that can be applied to a future month’s bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power is currently paying those participants $0.16 per kilowatt hour for the excess power they generate, and wants to grandfather them for 25 years, while offering new participants $0.04 per kilowatt hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a customer who needs about 1,000 kilowatts of electricity, and generates 1,057 kilowatts through their panels, the change would result in a monthly bill increase from $7.96 to $66.95. An APCo customer who doesn’t participate in net metering faces a monthly bill of $174 under current rates, which </span><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/appalachian-power-rate-increase-virginia-utility-aep/article_2b39b428-6fc7-11ef-ab1c-6b350691a782.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">may</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go up again, despite resident and legislator opposition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate change also reflects a change in netting methodology for new participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the old system, the customer would generate a total amount of electricity for a given month and net that against the power they pulled from the utility when their source was not generating enough, which happened 80% of the time in a year and resulted in the savings, according to the utility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new methodology would compensate a customer for the excess energy they send back to the grid, at the new rate, and then charge them, at standard rates, for the energy they pull from the utility when their generation source wasn&#8217;t meeting their needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proposed netting methodology will still allow the customer-generator to offset their usage with their solar generation that is equal to or less than their usage in a given hour at full retail rate,” said company spokeswoman Teresa Hall. “But any excess generation that is exported to the company’s system will not be carried over to a different hour when they are using energy from the company,” Hall said. Instead, “it will instead be given a bill credit at the avoided cost rate proposed in the petition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company asked for the reduction and change largely because participants rely on the overall grid’s transmission and distribution system to sell their power back to the utility, or draw in power when their solar doesn’t produce enough of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the 3,860 program’s participants — who represented about .07% of APCo’s 542,000 customers in 2023 — don’t pay for the costs to maintain that grid, the utility said, which resulted in a $3.8 million savings that year coming from non-participants, who do pay the fees for maintaining transmission and distribution lines. The company said this is an inequitable arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Due to the inherent cross-subsidization in the current net metering program, non-participating customers, including low-income customers and/or customers that are members of environmental justice communities bear a disproportionate share of the costs necessary to facilitate net metering as it exists today,” attorneys for Appalachian Power wrote in their petition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar developers, though, counter that having more net metering solar projects on the grid creates more distributed generation resources and reduces the wear and tear on those transmission and distribution lines by not relying on them as much. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As data centers proliferate in Virginia, demand for electricity is expected to increase, which will increase the need for costly improvements to transmission and distribution lines to deliver more power, said Russ Edwards, president of Tiger Solar, a solar developer that has done business in APCo territory. APCo can recover those costs from customers, plus a roughly 10% return on equity, or profit margin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Demand) has been flat for a while. It’s not any longer,” said Edwards. “That’s a big deal and should be in the public’s best interest for all utilities to promote distributed generation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">APCo stated that participation in net metering has increased by 31.6% from the 1,310 participants it had in 2018, and has generated a total of 36.9 megawatts, about 1% of the 3,225 MW peak amount of electricity the utility produced in 2023. The generation that net metering customers relieve the grid of “definitely won’t go up,” Edwards said under the new program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference in the final bill costs between the old rate and the new rate may only be about $59, but when residents are considering whether to participate to save about $108 on a bill, compared to non-participants, Edwards said, the change could increase the amount of financing needed and the time period from when the savings will pay off the cost of the solar panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes the economics way more challenging,” Edwards said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unless the nascent technology of an energy storage device can be paired with a project to provide power when a generation source isn’t producing, Southern Environmental Law Center staff attorney Josephus Allmond said, the detrimental effects of reducing the net-metering payment rate has been experienced in California, which one </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/california-puc-net-metering-policy-nem-appeals-court/702569/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said lead to a loss of 77% to 85% in sales and 17,000 jobs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The risk of reduced net metering participation also comes after the federal government announced it’s giving Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/23/president-biden-visits-prince-william-park-to-talk-solar-youth-involvement-on-earth-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$156 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to deploy more solar alongside other funding opportunities.  And solar projects on rooftops can help avoid conflicts with </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/community/orangenews/the-sun-has-set-on-solar-development-in-orange-county/article_8625ded8-664f-11ef-a390-6b9fff43d167.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that are concerned with losing agricultural and forested land to panels needed to reverse climate change, Allmond said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We need utilities to show us some solutions. Customers deserve that,” Allmond said. “Given (the) funding on the way to Virginia for low income solar, ApCo&#8217;s petition to slash the net metering compensation rate by roughly 70% will hamper residential solar, a crucial part of the energy transition.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Corporation Commission is expected to review the request over the next 12 months, with several other parties interested in being involved, including Solar United Neighbors, Clean Virginia and more, since the result could set a precedent ahead of Dominion submitting its petition next year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Published Wednesday, the </span><a href="https://www.aceee.org/press-release/2024/09/study-one-four-low-income-households-spend-over-15-income-energy-bills" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found that nationally, 25% of low-income households spend more than 15.2% of their income on those costs. In Richmond, the energy costs for low-earning residents are even higher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of income a household spends on energy costs is called energy burden. That energy burden is considered high when households spend more than 6% of their income on it, and called severe when it takes up more than 10% of a household’s income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving energy efficiency — the idea of sealing up buildings and using modern appliances so less energy is needed to keep homes warm, cool and illuminated — can lessen the energy burden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is an update from ACEEE’s 2020 </span><a href="https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/u2006.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was used in a 2023 Nature Conservancy </span><a href="https://rampages.us/wilderresearch/wp-content/uploads/sites/37363/2023/01/Pitt-et-al.-2023-Analysis-of-the-Impacts-of-RGGI-and-the-HIEE-Program-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailing energy burden statewide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACEEE’s latest report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used data from the 2021 U.S. Census Bureau’s American Housing Survey. The households reviewed were single family homes, or within a multi-family building made up of four or less units, and included those who own and rent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, 25% of all households with the highest energy burden spend more than 5.1%. Of those, Black and Hispanic households have an energy burden above 6.9% and 6.2%, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, the 25% of all households with the highest energy burden spend more than 5.7%, with black and Hispanic households spending more than 7.2% and 6.2%, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report calls out Richmond as one of two examples, the other being Boston, of what low-income households face with a median annual income of $20,000 and a median annual utility bill of $1,800, or monthly bill of $150. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That household would have an energy burden of 9%, but for the 25% of low-income households in the city earning $11,700 a year or less, and with the annual energy bill as high as $2,640, which is the case for three-quarters of Richmond’s low-income households, “the energy burden skyrockets to 22.6%,” the report stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roxana Ayala, lead author of the policy brief and senior local policy research analyst at ACEEE, said in a statement on the overall findings that low-income households are likely to live in older buildings that are less energy-efficient. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The households that are least able to afford the upfront costs of home energy upgrades are the ones that most need utility bill savings, so bringing low- or no-cost efficiency improvements to them is vital to reduce their burdens,” Ayala stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report provides several policy recommendations to ease the energy burden on low-income families, including ways to make cost-saving programs more </span><a href="https://www.aceee.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/adapting_energy_efficiency_programs_to_reach_underserved_residents_-_encrypt.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accessible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also points to funding opportunities in the federal Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to provide energy efficiency upgrades.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon market requiring electricity producers to buy allowances for the carbon they emit with the goal of reducing those emissions over time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state received nearly $830 million for its programs prior to withdrawing from RGGI.

(Kristin Herring/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Madison University professor Mace Bentley had a friend living on the Eastside of Atlanta who noticed his VCRs and TVs going on the fritz after several lightning strikes during thunderstorms that would move west across the sprawling Southeast city. It was a comparatively minor issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fire chief of a nearby station told Bentley and a colleague that he “hardly” had “enough trucks to send out for these fires that are occurring from lightning strikes.” That, and other anecdotal evidence, spurred Bentley to dig into the data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When they surveyed data sets, Bentley said, “We found … there’s more lightning that’s occurring downwind from the city. It looked like the city was actually enhancing lightning and producing this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bentley has continued that research, now with a focus closer to Virginia. In July, he </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169809524001844?dgcid=rss_sd_all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> findings that show from 2006 to 2020, between the months of May and September as pollution levels increased from cities, including the Washington D.C. metro area, lightning strikes also increased. The research offers a look at the potential, present day impact of climate change in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of the research on climate change, most of the press, is global climate change. We didn&#8217;t want to think about climate change from the standpoint of what is going to happen 20 years from now,” Bentley said. “We want to see: Are humans impacting the climate right now and where and how much?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research included reviewing lightning strike data gathered from the </span><a href="https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/home/lightning/index/data_nldn" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Lightning Detection Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The locations of those strikes were traced back to where storm events were observed to have traveled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bentley then looked up hourly air quality monitoring data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to find levels of particulate matter 2.5 and particulate matter 10, tiny carcinogens that are 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter, respectively, which come from tailpipe emissions, industrial and manufacturing activity and several other sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research then determined when there were high levels of Convective Available Potential Energy, or CAPE, a metric used to measure the atmospheric conditions that are ripe for lightning activity. As the CAPE increases with hot humid air at the ground level and cooler air above, when pollution enters the mix during those “dog days of summer,” Bentley said, it leads to more lightning flashes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bentley and his team found that pollution is “affecting thunderstorm development, electrification and thunderstorm intensity over time,” Bentley said, noting the right CAPE conditions are needed before pollution can create more lightning strikes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can&#8217;t say, &#8216;oh, it&#8217;s a polluted day, so we&#8217;re going to get thunderstorms.’ That&#8217;s not the case. Pollution is like an accelerant,” Bentley said. “Once you get a thunderstorm, it&#8217;s like a fire accelerant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even at low, medium and high levels of CAPE, the research further found that increased pollution levels still produced more lightning strikes, showing “the pollution is really playing a fundamental ingredient in electrifying these storms,” Bentley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington D.C. area lightning strikes also happened the most on Thursdays, later in the week, after people have been commuting to work and driving around and enough pollution has built up, before winding back down over the weekend — all while CAPE levels remained the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s like when you turn on the heat on your stove, the water doesn&#8217;t boil instantaneously. It takes a while. That heat has to transfer to the water, and then finally gets hot and boils,” Bentley said. “The same thing happens with cities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research also found that size of the pollutant didn’t matter; it was the volume of them within the atmosphere that counted. Larger cities like D.C. can also impact regional communities, like Fredericksburg, Charlottesville and Richmond, the data also found, with winds strong enough to push a storm around. Smaller cities can also have an impact on surrounding communities, just at a smaller scale, Bentley added.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Mace Bentley)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storms are ones that pop up on a moment&#8217;s notice and may last for about an hour, Bentley said, much like the one on Aug. 26, wherein </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-09-03/cardinal-elementary-reopen-richmond-public-schools-fire" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardinal Elementary school</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Richmond was struck by lightning and caught fire around </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/cardinal-elementary-school-fire-aug-26-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6:54 p.m.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Wakefield office of the National Weather Service, </span><a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/product.php?site=AKQ&amp;issuedby=RIC&amp;product=CLI&amp;format=CI&amp;version=30&amp;glossary=0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">temperatures reached</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 93 degrees with a relative humidity of 93% that day. The storm formed at about 6 p.m. northwest of Richmond before rain fell at 6:10 pm. And temperatures cooled as the storm disappeared on the Southeast side of the city around 7 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Bentley said he wasn’t exactly sure exactly how pollution levels may have influenced it, he added, “I think it could have very well been associated” with the air quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Wray, meteorologist with the Wakefield office of the National Weather Service, said he wasn’t able to speak to the findings of the research, but acknowledged that isolated storms like those popping up in the summer time generally “is not really an uncommon thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storms in Hurley and Whitewood in Southwest Virginia in 2021 and 2022, respectively, led to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">devastating flooding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and are examples of quickly formed storms dumping inches of rain in a short period, Bentley acknowledged. Those storms were a few hours longer and located in rural areas with less traffic than an urban environment, but pollution in those areas can come from far away distances, like smoke from the fires in Canada did </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/12/as-smoke-from-canada-enters-virginia-research-links-climate-change-with-more-frequent-wildfires/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leading to health warnings across the state. The toxins can then become trapped by the surrounding mountainous terrain, Bentley added, similarly to the smog issues mountain-bound communities in California’s Los Angeles County deal with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research on D.C.-area cities is similar to findings Bentley made in Kansas City and in Bangkok, Thailand; the common denominator is the pollution, Bentley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You could probably go around the world where you have different particle sizes impacting the atmosphere, but if the content remains relatively the same, you might get this similar electrification for a thunderstorm.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s two ways to address the matter, Bentley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/10/virginias-future-concerning-vehicle-electrification-is-bright-but-costs-are-a-challenge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lower pollution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> levels through multitudes of innovative technologies we&#8217;ve got,” Bentley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also key: Helping hot cities cool off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And also put in more green space so that you make the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/10/research-shows-heat-exposure-disproportionately-affects-black-richmonders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heat island</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cooler.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one sense, car travel can be traced all the way back to 3500 BC in the Middle East when Mesopotamians invented the wheel and axle to transport items. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash forward through the advent of the horse and buggy and the Ford Model T, the U.S. and Virginia are undergoing the latest stage in four-wheel travel: the adoption of electric vehicles that run on rechargeable batteries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The process is happening, and it&#8217;s happening faster everyday,” said Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, an electric vehicle owner. “It’s part of the natural evolution of technology. It’s not an infringement on anybody. It is a phased-in process. It’s a transition of the kind we’ve experienced before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as the demand for reducing carbon emissions and purchasing electric vehicles grows, government and transit agencies in Virginia are facing questions about how they will meet such expectations. At the center of these charged efforts is the substantial costs of implementing the technology statewide, and how different levels of government are helping to support the transition through policy and funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The electrification of the transportation industry is an opportunity, and also a disruption, to the national power economy that the Governor’s All-American, All-of-the-Above energy plan contends with,” Christian Martinez, a press secretary for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">High costs for everyone</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities across the commonwealth agree that the costs to pay for electric vehicles and chargers can add up quickly, even for some of the most affluent jurisdictions. Local leaders have said state and federal grants have become vital to the transition statewide, but they also believe there is a long-term benefit for the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, Fairfax County, one of the most affluent counties in the commonwealth, organized its Operational Energy Strategy, which included goals to electrify its fleet and have a 100% carbon-free fleet by 2035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Fairfax has 12  electric buses in its transit connector fleet with four more in production, two electric trash trucks, and an electric box truck to move supplies, all purchased through grants from the Environmental Protection Agency. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36067" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/23/dominion-dulles-break-ground-on-nations-largest-renewable-energy-project-at-an-airport/img_0518/" rel="attachment wp-att-36067"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36067 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_0518-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  An electric bus used by the city of Alexandria on display as an example of one Dulles Airport would use. (Charlie Paullin/The Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Morrill, director of Fairfax’s Office of Environmental and Energy Coordination, said Fairfax’s “inclination to pursue the goal of electrification and the goal of carbon neutrality was perhaps facilitated by the county having staff already working in this area toward environmental goals, the external funding is absolutely critical.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to Fairfax County, affluent Alexandria adopted a goal in 2019 of transitioning the city’s vehicles to full electric by 2040, but it’s falling short of its aim to convert 25% of the fleet by the end of this fiscal year, June 30,  because of delays, including the pandemic when funding was scarce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the city has acquired 65 electric vehicles, 45 hybrids, 6 plug-in hybrids and 42 hybrid electric buses, said Ursula Ramos, a spokesperson for the city’s transportation and electrification office. The costs for the passenger vehicles have ranged from $25,000 to $55,000, as costs for some heavy duty trucks and buses have ranged from from $500,000 to $1.8 million per vehicle, Ramos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The locality is working on a study, expected to be completed by the end of the year, to fully evaluate how much transitioning a vehicle may cost in the long term, which will present a perspective beyond the sticker shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We anticipate getting some savings over the life of the vehicle through maintenance and fuel costs, and we are also taking advantage of the IRS’s direct pay incentives that provide some incentives for the purchase of any alternative fuel vehicles,” said Amy Posner, electric vehicle planner for Alexandria. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keith Harless, town manager of Pennington Gap in Lee County, said the town partnered with Virginia Clean Cities to promote electric vehicles in rural areas three years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said one of the challenges for rural areas with charging stations is being patient on the revenue return. The town manager said rural areas “most likely” won’t have day-to-day users compared to more densely populated areas like  cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that is not stopping the town of approximately 1,600 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harless said the town has a charging station and two others expected to be available this month, thanks to grant funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We recognized years ago that even though we are a small town, we still want to be able to prepare for the future, regardless of what comes &#8230; we would still like to accommodate anybody that’s visiting our town,” Harless said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How Virginia is participating in the transition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Virginia has dedicated millions to clean transportation projects following the 2016 </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/topics-of-interest/volkswagen-settlement-agreement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volkswagen settlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which required the major car maker to make payments toward environmental remediation because of allegations of cheating on emissions tests, the state’s vehicle electrification transition has included some proposals from lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the policy goals were intended to drive the public toward purchasing electric vehicles, and to help localities with funds. However, those efforts have been mostly unfruitful, as the state legislature and governor’s administration have collided on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic members of the legislature pushed for new electric vehicle sales by passing a law in 2021 that tied Virginia’s tailpipe emissions to the stringent “Clean Car” standards passed by California, which takes periodic steps toward ultimately banning the sale of new gas-powered cars in 2035. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though gas-powered cars could still be used and bought from the used car market under the standards, Republican legislators and Youngkin have opposed the policy, arguing that people should transition to electric vehicles at their own pace. In June, despite the 2021 legislation, Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/youngkin-says-virginia-wont-follow-californias-clean-car-standards-anymore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to take up the only other option: following the federal standards next year. It was a move that some legislators opposed and others embraced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no doubt that those intent on mandating what citizens are allowed to drive will have the inclination to challenge this, but I&#8217;m hopeful we ultimately recognize we are better off when we make our own policies and decisions as a Commonwealth — not be forced to tie our yolk to a state like California,” said Del. Tony Wilt, R-Rockingham, in a July statement.  Still, Wilt acknowledged  both air pollution improvements and cost concerns with the standards.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares held an event at a Richmond-area Toyota dealership to announce Virginia would no longer follow California&#8217;s clean car standards.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Clean Cars policy had been seen as the best way to curb the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">country’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/19685/638411885888070000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> largest source of emissions, those coming from transportation, which are causing climate change’s increasing storm intensities. But to offset the costs of electric vehicles, the federal government has been the only provider of government-based point-of-sale rebates or tax breaks in the amount of $7,500 through the Inflation Reduction Act, which funds many of its initiatives through a tax on corporations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those incentives have been </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/14/1251096758/biden-china-tariffs-ev-electric-vehicles-5-things" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tough</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use, because of federal requirements mandating electric vehicle components be made in America that come with them, yet Virginia’s government  hasn’t funded  a $2,500 </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title45.2/chapter17/article8/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rebate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program through Virginia Energy, which could help offset costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do I wish that had been and was being funded? The answer to that is yes,” said Sullivan. “I await the day when Virginia, both the legislature and the governor, make the decision to fund that program.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to The Mercury’s query on how much interest there has been in the rebate program, the Virginia Department of Energy sent a statement from Director Glenn Davis, a former Republican lawmaker, that said “bipartisan consensus has remained to this day” on deciding the program “was not worthy of funding.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martinez, with the Youngkin administration, didn’t address costs directly in his statement, but said that with federal funding available, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">state agencies across Virginia … are pursuing opportunities aligned with the Governor’s vision to foster innovation and ensure Virginians have access to reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state government is grappling to gauge  the cost of electric vehicles for its own use,  by way of legislation that passed in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/06/17/under-new-law-virginias-government-fleet-is-poised-to-go-electric/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fully assess the cost of transitioning state vehicles to electric. Similar to Alexandria’s study in evaluating maintenance and fuel cost for purchasing an electric or gas vehicle, the state is supposed to purchase a gas vehicle only if the assessment “clearly indicates” it&#8217;s the cheaper option when looking at the lifetime of the costs instead of the sticker price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of General Services, which oversees the state’s facilities and cars, said 99% of their vehicles are gas powered, with less than 1% being electric or hybrid. Those percentages are the same breakdown for vehicles bought in 2024, said Killeen Wells, deputy director of communications, when “only 1% of purchases showed an electric vehicle as being more affordable and operationally viable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides cots, there are other factors for the state to contend with when purchasing EVs, Wells said, including “limited electric vehicle availability to government fleets” and lack of infrastructure at our state agencies and cost.” There’s no defined timeline to transition the state’s fleet fully to electric vehicles, Wells added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Electric vehicles are purchased when the electric vehicle meets the commonwealth&#8217;s operational and financial criteria,” she said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30765" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1200px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/03/01/biden-oks-release-of-30-million-barrels-of-oil-from-strategic-petroleum-reserve/gas/" rel="attachment wp-att-30765"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-30765" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/gas.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/gas.jpg 1200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/gas-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/gas-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/gas-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The average gas price in Virginia has dropped below $4 per gallon for the first time in months, according to AAA. (NBC12)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Transportation launched an electric vehicle pilot program last year after purchasing a number of trucks for the agency. However, like others, VDOT has faced a significant delay in acquiring and using electric vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Berg, assistant director of VDOT’s environmental divisions, said the agency is deploying them across the commonwealth in different use cases to determine the feasibility of bringing electric vehicles into the agency’s fleet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re really in the early days of looking at how to bring electric vehicles into our VDOT fleet,” Berg said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has also put $39.9 million toward the purchase of battery-electric buses from the state’s share of the 2016 Volkswagen settlement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How federal EV funding is being put to use statewide, from schools to law enforcement </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With local support and the overwhelming amount of federal funding, schools in Virginia have been the most notable groups to benefit from the transition from diesel to electric. In addition, local governments have also started to convert their fleets of vehicles but are still facing challenges with costs and charging.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;White House unveils $1 billion for electric and low-emission school buses&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/08/white-house-unveils-1-billion-for-electric-and-low-emission-school-buses/embed/#?secret=bumLCKvEv3#?secret=t6PQ3gO7QS" data-secret="t6PQ3gO7QS" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Fairfax, the school division purchased 73 electric buses, most of which were paid for by the U.S. </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanschoolbus" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Protection Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a competitive grant from Dominion Energy. The Fairfax County Joint Environmental </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/environment-energy-coordination/joint-environmental-task-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Task Force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a group that worked to address climate change and environmental sustainability, provided assistance in purchasing three electric buses. Currently, there are 1,625 school buses in the division’s fleet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“FCPS School Board and Administration recognize the importance of protecting our children and community by eliminating emissions into the atmosphere and reducing our dependence on fossil fuels,” said Steven Brasley, a spokesman for Fairfax schools, adding that the county plans to convert school buses and other fleet vehicles to electric or zero-carbon alternatives by 2035.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brasley said Fairfax would advise other school divisions interested in switching to electric to work with their local utility provider to ensure infrastructure and agreements are in place and to take their time. Training drivers, maintenance technicians, and supervisors are critical to success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some schools are still working to reduce emissions through alternatives to purchasing electric buses. Others have tabled the idea. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the southeastern part of Virginia, Newport News Public Schools </span><a href="https://sbo.nn.k12.va.us/news/archive/2024-01-08_NNPS-receives-government-grant-for-propane-school-buses.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in January that it would be using other alternative fuel sources, such as propane, for buses. The school division announced it was awarded a grant of $525,000 from the EPA to replace 15 diesel school buses with propane buses. The acquisition would bring the city’s total of propane buses to 168 out of a total fleet  of 318.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rappahannock County Public Schools Superintendent Shannon Grimsley said her division has not purchased any electric buses. She said until the infrastructure is available, it does not make much sense for the district to switch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grimsely said the school division also faces challenges with meeting the qualifications for grant funding, terrain and the lack of available charging resources presently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We researched and even collaborated with other districts on available grant programs to purchase electric buses, but the partial rebates and up front infrastructure costs associated with these programs made the concept cost prohibitive for us to pursue further,” Grimsley said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement is also considering converting its fleet, but in smaller steps, as the technology continues to develop for electric patrol vehicles. </span></p>

(Photo Courtesy of Fairfax County Police Department)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County Police Department has acquired five electric vehicles through a procurement process as part of its fleet with over 1,200 vehicles. The vehicles, which range in costs between $25,000 to $75,000, are used for recruitment primarily by administrative staff, but are being considered for other uses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department said one of the keys was having the infrastructure in place before receiving the electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its 2019 </span><a href="https://www.government-fleet.com/324588/va-police-gets-ev-for-response-at-public-events" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia Capitol Police has been operating a six-seat electric vehicle, which was purchased from Global Electric Motorcars (GEM), a subsidiary of Minnesota-based Polaris Industries using grant funds from the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2021, Polaris sold GEM to Waev Inc. based in Anaheim, California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spokesman Joe Macenka said the Capitol Police’s six-seat GEM, licensed for use on city streets and capable of traveling 25 MPH with a range of 35 miles, helps to transport people around the 13-acre Capitol Square. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Col. Anthony S. “Steve” Pike, former Capitol Police chief, announced that the GEM could reach all state properties the division is assigned to protect in Richmond. He said GEM would be less expensive to operate than a traditional police vehicle and have less of an impact on the environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the impact transportation use has on climate change and direct </span><a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/transportation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">air quality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> benefits, Posner, with Alexandria, said the transition to electric vehicles is “pretty critical to meet our overall environmental and climate action goals.”</span></p>

Read their responses below, and stay tuned for in-depth profiles of these candidates in the coming weeks.

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only state in the South that hasn’t restricted abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade in 2022, which made abortion a federal right, Virginia is a key player in the country’s reproductive health landscape. By dismantling Roe v Wade, the nation’s highest court laid the groundwork for each state to restrict or enhance access to abortion; a spate of state bans on abortion have since emerged, with 14 states making the procedure illegal. Abortion remains legal in Virginia and state Democrats will push to enshrine it as a right in the commonwealth’s constitution next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican candidates in Virginia’s congressional races assert that abortion access should be determined at the state level. In District 2, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, a Navy veteran, nurse and former member of the state senate, has “consistently advocated for women to choose life, but respects exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother,” according to her campaign </span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who is also a Navy veteran as well as the director of a nonprofit focused on women veterans, </span><a href="https://fb.watch/uhpo6DTiSN/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the only pro-choice Navy veteran in this race.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, anchored in Prince William County but also spanning rural parts of the state, Spotsylvania attorney and former Green Beret Derrick Anderson, a Republican, is challenging career military officer and Democrat Eugene Vindman for the seat currently occupied by Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year. Anderson has expressed support for the overturn of Roe and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerrickAndersonforVA/videos/my-life-story-is-pro-life-and-thats-how-i-will-serve-in-congress-my-mother-got-p/414067620643367/?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life” while sharing on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his mother had him as a single parent at 17 years old. Vindman plans to support </span><a href="https://vindmanforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to abortions and contraception along with in vitro fertilization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, anchored in Loudoun County, Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is running against Republican Mike Clancy to fill Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s seat. Wexton will not seek reelection due to a health issue, and endorsed Subramanyam during his democratic primary. He has supported an effort to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to support federal protections. Clancy said that he “does not support federal action on abortion.” His campaign website lists “respect life” as a campaign issue and notes his support for resources for pregnant people and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, incumbent Rep. Morgan Griffith faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, a lawyer-turned-nurse. Griffith has voted against congressional efforts to protect abortion access and </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Roe v. Wade had “produced decades of tragedy.” Baker wrote on her campaign website that “women’s choices must be respected.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ksn63EC7JL"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/embed/#?secret=H3VtqeFCdu#?secret=Ksn63EC7JL" data-secret="Ksn63EC7JL" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who is seeking reelection, has co-sponsored the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/kaine-others-reintroduce-reproductive-freedom-for-all-act/article_f6cbd514-a8a7-11ed-8ac8-e388ae499856.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive Freedom For All Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would protect access federally, now that Roe has been overturned. His Republican challenger, retired Navy veteran Hung Cao, told Virginia Mercury this summer that he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t support a federal abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has also </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/right-to-life/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life.” </span></a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is an issue people experience practically and constantly, amid paying rent or mortgages. Local governments handle approvals or rejections of developments and craft zoning laws that guide development potential. But state and federal lawmakers have roles to play as well — largely through funding mechanisms or taking action where housing intersects with other policy platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many congressional candidates this year don’t have housing policy outlined on their websites, some have been talking about how they plan to help states and local governments from the federal level. The Mercury reached out to others for more details on what they would do to help with housing supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 2, Incumbent Rep. Jen Kiggans did not respond to inquiry for more details on housing policy by the time of this publication, though during her time in the state legislature as a senator, she voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0271HB1889+HB1889" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her challenger, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, acknowledged the Mercury’s request for comment but did not follow through with a response in time for this publication. Her website touches on housing policy while addressing the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the price gouging on groceries, and stop massive corporations from buying up houses and raising rent,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Democratic candidate Eugene Vindman expressed support for building more homes that middle-class families can purchase and “support programs that help first-time homebuyers buy a house.” He added that he’s concerned about out-of-state corporations buying homes that they then sell or rent at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Congress, I will work to take on these speculators who are putting regular people&#8217;s American dream out of reach,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidate Derrick Anderson said he’s going to focus initially on how Congress can help reduce inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I’d do is pass a federal balanced budget amendment – ridiculous inflationary spending drove up housing prices (and grocery costs, gas costs, etc),” he said in an email. “Let’s stop the spending and get inflation down for the sake of Virginians who are struggling to get by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, Republican Mike Clancy could not be reached for comment by the time of this publication. His campaign website doesn’t include housing policy, but it does stress his goal of helping to reduce inflation and stimulate the economy by “unleashing American innovation” and energy as well as reducing regulations on small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Suhas Subramanyam’s campaign replied to The Mercury’s inquiry but did not follow through with his housing policy plans should he become a congressman before publication. He has supported affordability measures as a state senator: This year he </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to allow more Virginian localities to utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits when approving developments, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Democratic challenger Karen Baker supports expansion of tax credits that can help spur construction of affordable housing available to various levels of area median income. She also wants to</span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/affordable-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “work on tailored solutions that address the specific needs of rural communities,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Southwest Virginia ones she seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his tenure as representative, Morgan Griffith has </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriations to his district meant to help with affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has cited his early-career experience as a fair housing lawyer before he went into politics. As a member of congress, he pointed to a bill he co-sponsored, the </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/klobuchar-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Supply and Affordability Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program for state and local governments to tap into. He’s also been involved with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish fixed-rate 20 year mortgages for first-time buyers whose income doesn’t exceed a certain amount. Both bills have been introduced multiple times but have yet to become law. Kaine also supports expansions to Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which helps increase affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent, Hung Cao, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoes a stance of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that ties housing issues to the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First and foremost, we need to secure the border,” Cao said in an email to The Mercury. “Everything that’s going wrong in our country right now is a direct result of our wide-open southern border. Housing costs are at an all-time high because there&#8217;s millions who were not here a few years ago for which we need to provide housing.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress remains at a standstill as lawmakers fiercely debate the future of gun rights in America, with proponents of stricter gun control measures clashing with staunch defenders of the Second Amendment. Amid a surge in mass shootings and growing public outcry, both sides are digging in, setting the stage for what will likely be another defining battle over gun laws as the nation is headed toward the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor of Virginia when the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech took place in 2007, co-sponsored the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence, which he said would enact the same gun safety provisions passed by the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly in 2020 at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hung Cao, Kaine’s Republican opponent, strictly opposes further legislation that he believes would infringe Second Amendment rights. Instead, Cao proposes that gun-related violence to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law must be held accountable, the retired U.S. Navy captain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, in 2023 received a 100% rating by Gun Owners of America (GOA), a national gun rights organization, and a 92% rating by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the previous year. While in the Virginia legislature, Kiggans has voted against universal background checks, expanding red flag laws that take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and those who pose a threat to Virginians, and against prohibiting guns in schools and childcare centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Kiggans’ Democratic opponent, states on her campaign website that she is committed to legislation seeking to prevent gun violence, create safer communities, and prevent veteran suicide. Smasal said that there are “commonsense measures supported by large majorities of Virginians” that can make Virginia’s neighborhoods safer while also protecting individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee, has stated that Second Amendment rights are sacred and shall not be infringed upon. As a former special forces Green Beret, Anderson vows to be “a strong advocate for gun owners in the halls of Congress.” Earlier this year, the Republican turned to the social media platform X, where </span><a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1774127722647687559" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Americans have to “stand up for and protect our 2nd Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a former career military officer and the Democratic nominee, supports gun safety measures such as background checks and red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and others who might cause harm. While he believes in the right of law-abiding gun owners to own firearms, Vindman also pushes for more legislation ensuring public safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, is a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Griffith said in a statement to The Mercury that he does not support government-mandated registrations of guns but that he backs harsher penalties for offenders who “abuse the right to have guns” by committing felonious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent and a gun owner, said she backs rigorous gun safety training for children in school. She is also pushing for enhanced gun safety laws, including tax credits for trigger locks, and she has called for enhanced mental health services for troubled individuals, and a legal mechanism to manage early reports of suspicious behaviors involving non-imminent ideation of shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state in District 10, constitutional lawyer Mike Clancy, the Republican nominee, has vowed to defend Americans’ constitutional rights without exception, including the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Instead of regulating gun ownership. Clancy is pushing for legislation to fully fund law enforcement to ensure law enforcement has the training and equipment to protect Virginia’s communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Virginia’s state legislature, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent, has actively supported several gun safety laws, including </span><a href="https://www.suhasforvirginia.com/press-and-media/key-gun-violence-prevention-bills-from-senator-subramanyam-vetoed-by-gun-lobby-backed-governor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several measures which passed the General Assembly just this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two of which were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Suhas told The Mercury he believes America can achieve serious progress on this issue while respecting the Second Amendment, and without undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education/Project 2025</h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With divergent calls from some to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and from others to improve teacher pay, public education is a top matter for voters in Virginia and across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in April, half of the Americans surveyed said that public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction. Some believe that schools should spend more time on core academic subjects. At the same time, communities, including those in Virginia, are sparring over what is taught in schools, particularly history, and gauging if students are falling behind in their studies and how to address that challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are also facing confrontation from parents over social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in schools and the treatment of transgender students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these education issues and recommendations to address them are outlined in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House. Some support the plan and others fear it could derail previous efforts to improve public education in Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state’s District 2 congressional race, Republican nominee and incumbent Jen Kiggans has publicly supported</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prioritizing students&#8217; safety and security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and equipping teachers with tools and resources to improve student outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She voted for the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents Bills of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a measure to “ensure the rights of parents are honored in public schools” and stands against critical race theory, a graduate-level framework that focuses on racial inequity and has not been found in Virginia curricula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the authors of Project 2025 and Kiggans, the Republican nominee for the District 10 seat Mike Clancy said he supports school choice. </span></p>
<p>Democratic nominee Eugene Vindman, in District 7, said he opposes book bans and the project, which he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">sa</a>id his opponent and Republican nominee Derrick Anderson has failed to denounce.</p>
<p>Anderson said Vindman is “lying” and denied supporting the project&#8217;s proposal to eliminate the U.S. Department of <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Education</span>.</p>
<p>He said he supports helping students in his home district “succeed” and will advocate for ensuring that “test scores go up and conflicts go down.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Karen Baker, the democratic nominee, said she supports strengthening public schools, much like Vindman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Baker’s </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she supports making universal preschool “a reality for all families” in Southwest Virginia. She also supports investing in vocational education and making it accessible to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said if elected, he will work to expand Pre-K, access to “critical“ job training into apprentice programs, and support providing resources to local schools to close the pandemic, learning loss gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Mercury that if the recommendations for Project 2025 were implemented, it would “devastate” Virginia’s public education system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must do the opposite: invest in our schools, support our parents and teachers, and make college and postgraduate education affordable,” Subramanyam’s campaign said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environment/Climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates in Virginia’s congressional races largely have expressed the desire to address climate change by transitioning to zero-carbon generation sources. Some candidates differentiate themselves, like District 3 incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby </span><a href="https://www.bobbyscottforcongress.com/the-scott-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who’s advocated for funding Norfolk’s flood wall to reduce sea level rise damage. District 6 contender Ken </span><a href="https://www.kenmitchellforvirginia.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighted a need to “transition public investments away from propping up fossil fuel companies” on his campaign site, while District 11 incumbent U.S. Rep. Gerry </span><a href="https://gerryconnolly.com/issues/environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said he’s an advocate for environmental justice, an environmental lens that amplifies the voices and needs of overlooked and overburdened communities during development that could impact their area. District 9 candidate Karen </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/coal-miners" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t address climate change on her website, but highlights a need to protect coal miners’ health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the aisle, Republican congressional candidates also mostly fall in line with each other’s environmental policy views by advocating for  </span><a href="https://www.mikeclancyforcongress.com/services-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/enviornment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or promoting energy sources stemming from </span><a href="https://cline.house.gov/issues/energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sitkaforcongress.com/on-the-issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some candidates don’t take clear positions about their environmental policy plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking unique approaches on the GOP side are District 2 incumbent U.S. Rep Jen Kiggans, who signed onto a letter with other House Republicans earlier this year asking for House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/some-house-republicans-warn-against-climate-law-repeal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax credits of the IRA, which have helped incentivize a burgeoning offshore wind </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry in the Hampton Roads region. U.S. Rep.

District 7 candidate Derrick Anderson doesn’t offer a clear position on his website.</span></p>

Some environmental groups say the bill includes some concessions for continued natural gas use. Whichever party gains majority control of Congress could determine the fate of that bill.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over election integrity and the potential for voter fraud have sparked a renewed focus in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties debate how best to safeguard the democratic process. With allegations of fraudulent voting making headlines in recent election cycles, the issue has become a political flashpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some legislators call for stricter voting regulations to prevent potential abuse, others argue that such measures could suppress voter participation. As the 2024 election approaches, members of Congress are crafting new policies aimed at ensuring fair elections while addressing public concerns over security and accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has carried legislation such as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would implement provisions like automatic voter registration, same-day and Election Day voter registration, online voter registration, and no-excuse mail voting. Kaine has also co-sponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore and update crucial protections against voting discrimination that were weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has proposed few legislative means to secure the electoral process beyond a universal requirement for providing a voter ID in order to cast a ballot. But he said in a statement to The Mercury that “the only way to have election integrity is to have people watch the polls.” Cao has also suggested that the U.S. hold elections like the ones he witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where people vote with their finger and blue ink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, who represents House District 2, voted in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8281/BILLS-118hr8281rh.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed in the House of Representatives by a 221-198 vote. Advocates of the SAVE Act say it would ensure that only citizens can vote in federal elections, partly by making it mandatory for states to obtain proof of citizenship to register voters and also requiring states to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. But President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the measure, stating that it would make it more difficult for eligible voters to register and increase “the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who previously mounted an unsuccessful campaign in Virginia’s 8th Senate District, has talked little about election integrity legislation. But the U.S. Navy veteran has attacked her Republican opponent for being  a “big supporter of President Trump” for backing “Big Lie” conspiracy theorists in Virginia’s state legislature by being one of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/virginia-youngkin-tax-cuts-house-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four Senators to vote for an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 2020 election that would have cost Virginia taxpayers $70 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">former special forces Green Beret and the Republican nominee in District 7, has talked little publically about election integrity and he offers no clues about his views on his campaign website, but in </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Daily Progress he acknowledged that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Anderson’s Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, the twin brother of anti-Trump whistleblower Alexander Vindman, has vowed to work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and strengthen protections for election workers, “so that anyone who threatens a poll volunteer or election official in an attempt to undermine our vote is held accountable.” Vindman, whose family emigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has also warned against downplaying the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which he blamed on a pro-Trump movement that did not recognize the nation’s norms of peaceful transfer of power and that he said undermines elections across the country to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, in 2023 sponsored the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Vote for Non-Citizens Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to ensure only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. The bill, which is still moving through the House, withholds some federal dollars that go to localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. Griffith also voted for the SAVE Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent, told The Mercury that Republicans have failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and therefore there is no reason to believe that this year’s election will be different. Baker also stated that fears of undocumented immigrants voting are generated to induce distrust of election integrity but are absolutely without basis, and she has criticized Griffith for refusing to state that he will accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Mike Clancy, an attorney from Loudoun County and the Republican nominee in District 10, does not list election integrity as one of his legislative priorities on his campaign website, he has been outspoken on social media about strengthening election laws. “Congress must pass the SAVE Act,” Clancy </span><a href="https://x.com/MikeClancyVA/status/1811031488923586986" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. “Only U.S. citizens should be voting in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent and a strict opponent of the SAVE Act, believes that “democracy is under attack” in America. The son of Indian immigrants, Subramanyam has vowed to continue to fight against “restrictive voter ID laws that are designed to suppress the vote, protect early voting to ensure greater access to the polls, and combat political gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Americans find that more migrants are turning to the United States for employment opportunities or to escape violent conflict in their home countries, among other reasons, they are increasingly interested in candidates&#8217; views on immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America has become one of the most prominent destinations for migrants. However, over several years, many migrants have entered the country illegally, prompting backlash. At the same time, migrants have also been a staple of America’s workforce, including in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Immigration Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrants comprised about 12.6% of Virginia’s total population in 2022, and 16.2% of Virginia&#8217;s labor force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 9 race, Republican nominee and incumbent Morgan Griffith said immigrants are welcome to come to the United States “legally” and share in the “American dream,&#8221; but supports “cracking down” on illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While criticizing the House for ducking its responsibility, Democratic nominee Karen Baker in District 9 said Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform. She said she supports the Senate&#8217;s template for more border control agents and asylum officers and advocates for a DACA bill to protect children who have lived in the U.S. their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 2 race, Jen Kiggans’ campaign said the Republican nominee and incumbent voted for legislation to increase security at the U.S. border by ensuring that federal immigration officials have the training and resources to stop the influx of illegal immigration, drugs and crime into the U.S. The measure has remained in the Senate since last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans supports strict enforcement of existing federal immigration laws and holding President Joe Biden’s administration accountable. She also backed legislation to prevent the administration from using National Parks to house illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee for the District 7 seat, said he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">supports</a> shutting down the border.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the crisis at the border is hurting people right here in Virginia’s 7th District,” Anderson said in a statement. “Drugs, fentanyl, human trafficking – we need a serious change. We need to secure the border.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said with the U.S. immigration system being “broken,” he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem by starting with securing the border and ensuring that people who are doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy (Israel-Hamas conflict, China, Ukraine)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia voters are following their congressional candidates&#8217; views on common issues in the U.S., they are also considering their responses to global conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was completed in April, two of the most important issues to Americans are limiting the powers of China and finding a solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are also interested in limiting Russia’s powers following its invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he takes pride in the fact that he is among a wide slate of lawmakers President Vladimir Putin of Russia permanently banned from visiting Russia in response to his record of standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Kaine has voted for aid to Ukraine, and earlier this year he helped pass a supplemental package that included support for the country to defend its sovereignty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also said he views the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential bilateral relationship of the century. Kaine voted to pass the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHIPS and Science Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to outcompete China by shoring up domestic supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli territories on Oct. 7, 2023, Kaine has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration to ensure that Israel has defensive support. But Kaine has also called for a reduction of civilian casualties, supported the safe and swift delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and for long-term solutions to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live alongside each other in peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent and former U.S. Navy captain Hung Cao in a statement criticized the Biden administration and Congress for giving “blanket amounts of money” towards Ukraine’s defense effort, alleging the financial support instead helps fund Ukraine’s retired workers pension plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao considers China an “existential threat” to the United States, and he has further called for the continued support of Israel, which he considers one of the United States’ closest allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jen Kiggans’ campaign, the District 2 Republican nominee and incumbent supports legislation to impose sanctions against China for its responsibility in the fentanyl crisis and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/22/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent selling any petroleum to Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her campaign also said she prioritizes protecting American jobs and intellectual property from being stolen by the CCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in District 7 and a former special forces Green Beret with six tours of duty overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and various countries throughout the Middle East, told the </span><a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/virginia-congressional-candidate-derrick-anderson-military/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jewish Insider”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview in April that Congress needs to move quickly to provide additional aid to the Jewish state in its war against Hamas. He added that he was skeptical of sending more U.S. funds to the Palestinians, noting that other countries are providing aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Anderson, his Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, also a veteran, called for continued support for Israel, while asking that the U.S. continue to ensure that all the hostages — including Americans — are returned safe and sound to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has also pushed for the continued support of Ukraine in both military and economic terms, and for taking on China&#8217;s state-directed economic system, which he said unfairly competes in the market and compromises America’s national security. </span></p>

Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which allowed the lending and lease of American defense material to the country in its defense of the Russian invasion, he also also voted to block similar legislation last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> China a “dangerous, power-hungry actor” over the country’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as its escalating efforts to control Taiwan, while </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403086" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s decision to hold an arms shipment to Israel last spring. Griffith also said that America’s dealings with other countries must be driven by a careful analysis of what best serves the United States and its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Karen Baker, Griffith’s Democratic opponent, has pointed out that while she acknowledged Israel’s right to exist, there are “bad acts on both sides.” Baker has also endorsed the continued financial and military support of Ukraine by the United States, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said he supports the U.S. in opposing Russia leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe and standing up to China, which is “violating international law and illegally dumping goods to prop up their economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports the CHIPS Act, which helped to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Israel-Hamas war, Subramanyam said he supports the U.S. returning hostages, especially  American citizens, and helping to rebuild communities affected by the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports a two-state solution, adding that Hamas cannot be one of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The human lives lost in this conflict have been devastating for all sides,” Subramanyam said in a statement. “I have visited the region, including the areas of Israel that were attacked, and made good friends there. I want to see an end to the war and a long-term path to peace.”</span></p>

(Secure Futures Solar)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Virginia solar developers are again asking regulators  to tell Dominion Energy to suspend rules that the developers say are holding up mid-size projects for governments, schools and nonprofits throughout the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Aug. 16, the Distributed Solar Alliance filed its latest </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/80xf01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seeking injunctive relief with the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of newer requirements under the highly technical rules, some projects could be facing up to 3.5 years of delay before coming online, with project costs possibly ballooning by $450,000 or more, as opportunities to apply for federal tax credits go away, the DSA argued in its petition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s having a profound negative impact for Virginia, not only in terms of job losses, lost investments to the state, and the health impacts of not pursuing the aspirations of the Virginia Clean Economy Act,” said Tony Smith, chair of the Distributed Solar Alliance and founder of Secure Solar Futures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Dominion, in its </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/815m01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the latest petition, said the rules have already been “litigated and fully addressed” when the SCC granted temporary authority to impose them in November, and remain in compliance with state regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility reiterated that the SCC has regulatory authority over Dominion, but it’s the company’s ultimate responsibility to ensure “safe and reliable operation of its system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Commission should be highly skeptical of a request for injunctive relief which would second-guess and overrule the Company’s judgment in doing so,” wrote Joseph Reid, a McGuire Woods attorney representing the utility.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Repeated requests</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solar developers had previously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/01/utility-regulators-suspend-dominions-rules-for-connecting-solar-projects-to-grid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a case last August that forced Dominion to stop enforcing the rules for projects able to produce up to 3 megawatts of electricity.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1XVKMU9971"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/01/utility-regulators-suspend-dominions-rules-for-connecting-solar-projects-to-grid/">Utility regulators suspend Dominion&#8217;s rules for connecting solar projects to grid</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Utility regulators suspend Dominion&#8217;s rules for connecting solar projects to grid&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/01/utility-regulators-suspend-dominions-rules-for-connecting-solar-projects-to-grid/embed/#?secret=tzNqhvLn5C#?secret=1XVKMU9971" data-secret="1XVKMU9971" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/21/solar-developers-continue-to-fight-dominions-solar-interconnection-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">November</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the SCC granted Dominion the authority to temporarily reinstate the rules for a narrower set of projects, those that range from 250 kw to 1 mw, as a stakeholder group worked to make final decisions on what the interconnection rules should be. That work is ongoing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solar developers also introduced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/21/bill-to-shift-grid-upgrade-costs-for-small-virginia-solar-projects-fails/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this past legislative session to shift some of the cost of the rules’ requirements onto the utility. But Dominion pointed out that would’ve passed the costs onto customers who weren’t necessarily benefiting from the projects, since the utility is allowed to recover expenses from ratepayers. The bill failed.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The newer rules</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initial rules called for a dedicated transmission line, known as a dark trip transfer (DTT) cable, which connects the solar project to the grid so that the connection for that source can be turned off in the event of a failure and the broader system isn’t overloaded when excess power is returned to the utility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules also required a relay panel to efficiently shut off the power in those events, which the solar companies say are more costly than traditional, more affordable inverters that they say are sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The narrowed, temporary rules allowed for a less costly cellular fiber cable to be used as the DTT line, but now require that Verizon or AT&amp;T sign on to using the cable, the solar developers state in their petition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The temporary rules also have begun to ask for shunt trip breakers and a recloser,  technological upgrades for grid protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With those new requirements, the solar companies contend the utility is imposing a pilot program outside of the authority granted through the temporary rules, for projects that are less than half the 2.08 megawatt average size of ones Dominion interconnected prior to the creation of the December 2022 rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some projects have not been granted  permission to operate within the 30 to 60-day deadlines required by regulation. One developer, Madison Energy, has had  32 projects experience an average of 246 days and counting of delays since their application was submitted, the DSA stated. The utility also hasn’t been issuing waivers explaining why the deadline’s been missed, according to the petition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cliona Robb, a DSA attorney, wrote that Dominion has been “imposing greater equipment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">requirements and costs than approved by the ruling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That imposition has been reframed, “as a pilot project to continuously change the ground rules for interconnection at Dominion’s sole discretion, all without Commission authority,” Robb wrote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Dominion response</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion argued the temporary rules “fit squarely within applicable law and regulations and are necessary for the Company to fulfill its duty to provide safe and reliable electric service to the public.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority of projects prior to the creation of the December 2022 rules were smaller than 250 kilowatts, the utility stated, and projects that could produce between 500 kw and 1 megawatt did require some upgrades then, including the shunt trip breaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the changes stemming from the Virginia Clean Economy Act — a 2020 law that seeks to decarbonize the grid by mid-century, which expanded the size of projects eligible to sell electricity back to the grid — have led to an increase in the number of projects requesting interconnection that “necessitated a change to the review process,” the utility stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the increased need for the technological upgrades, Dominion said, the delays come from working with third-party vendors to attain actual cost estimates for protective enclosures, sometimes two for certain substation upgrades, beyond what was tested in its Dominion Energy Relay Laboratory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Verizon or AT&amp;T need to use the DTT  to keep the cable active in the event electricity is cut off from it, Dominion stated, and some project applications also are missing information necessary before they can be considered complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Company acknowledges that the process of addressing and resolving these technical issues and cost concerns have taken time and resulted in some delays,” Reid wrote in Dominion’s response, but the delays aren’t reason enough to grant the group’s requests because doing so “would compromise the Company’s grid and the safety of its customers and employees.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Broader delay?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest injunction request comes as the stakeholder group working on final rules for the SCC prepares to </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/80_c01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">receive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> evidentiary information from Dominion by Nov. 15. That will be followed by a full hearing on the evidence and insight from experts to testify on the effectiveness of the requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workgroup has already proposed a change to the current “</span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07052024/virginia-connecting-renewable-energy-to-grid/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last man in</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” concept that forces the last project to interconnect to a smaller circuit of the grid to pay for the technology because that project  could potentially overload the system. Instead, a clustered approach, to review multiple projects together, is being considered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But an order on the evidentiary hearing may not come until August of 2025, the DSA contended, depending on how the process proceeds after Dominion submits its evidence later this year. Because projects typically take a year to develop, some proposals may not come online until August 2026, the group said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in that timespan, another case on new rules for </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/DocketSearch#caseDocs/145038" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">net-metering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is set to take place, which could further change the rules for projects, Smith said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this line of work, things change very dynamically because of supply chain and other issues,” Smith said. The delays mean that a project that makes sense economically this year may not add up next year, Smith added.  “It&#8217;s causing menacing chaos.”</span></p>

Two seats on the air board, one of which was Cupit’s, have also been filled by former federal government workers associated with the Republican party, with appointments by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cupit, CEO of SERCAP, a group advocating on behalf of low-income communities in Southwest Virginia, ended her term on the Air Pollution Control Board on June 30, before she and Tyree were appointed to the EJ council by Youngkin on Aug. 16. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aimed at raising awareness of minority, low-income, tribal and other communities often overlooked during development of energy projects, the EJ council was created by executive order under the administration of former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and codified by the legislature during the era of Democratic trifecta control of state government, amid the Northam administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts to reach Cupit and EJ council chair Karen Camplin for comment were unsuccessful, but Tyree said her relevant experience for her role includes her being a county supervisor, and “t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he mere fact of standing on the principle of ‘treating people the way I would like to be treated.’” She also views her role as “being a voice for those that are not able to speak for themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m committed to addressing the systemic inequities that disproportionately affect marginalized communities and am eager to bring that focus to the Council,” Tyree said, adding that she plans to foster, “transparency and inclusivity throughout our processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the two seats on the air </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/laws-regulations/citizen-boards/air-pollution-control-board" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that opened up with the expiration of Cupit and Lornel Tompkins’ terms was filled by Emily Domenech, a senior vice president at the policy consultancy Boundary Stone Partners. The other seat was filled by Daniel Jorjani, chief operating officer and principal deputy general counsel for Citizens United, a conservative advocacy group. Citizens United in 2010 won a landmark  court case against the Federal Election Commission that ”tilted political influence toward wealthy donors and corporations,” according to the </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brennan Center for Justice.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The air board is charged with overseeing air quality protection regulations, while </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/02/07/republican-bills-aim-to-limit-power-of-citizen-environmental-boards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">permit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approvals lie with the Department of Environmental Quality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domenech joined Boundary Stone Partners in </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-influence/2024/03/12/boundary-stone-adds-top-mccarthy-energy-aide-00146597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and was previously a senior policy advisor for Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7225298739689598977/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jorjani</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> previously worked as solicitor general — the lead lawyer for cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court — for the U.S. Department of the Interior, which oversees federal lands, and was a member of former President Donald Trump’s transition team in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Patrick Guy II, chairman of the air board, said in an interview he didn’t know the two new appointees personally but said that they have “relevant experience” and are “imminently qualified,” after working in the energy and environment sphere for “quite a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for their commitment to environmental justice while serving on the air board, Guy said, generally, “there’s probably room to bring environmental justice into consideration in any matter,” adding that developers and utilities “have learned they’re going to have to do that.” Still, Guy noted that the board is only tasked with  approving </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/bill-stripping-citizen-air-and-water-boards-of-permitting-power-headed-to-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which sometimes come with stipulations from the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that are beyond their control.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/19/youngkin-speaks-about-energy-plan-ahead-of-update-in-coming-weeks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> past </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/20/democratic-legislator-questions-youngkins-appointments-to-environmental-justice-council/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appointments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the EJ council raised questions about their commitment to looking out for burdened communities. On Aug. 28,, Youngkin press secretary Christian Martinez said the latest appointments to both the EJ Council and the air board, “reflect a variety of communities and stakeholders across Virginia who are dedicated to furthering our shared commitment to protect our natural resources and vulnerable communities throughout the Commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill this past session would’ve forced Youngkin to make appointments to the EJ Council, had he not </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/14/gov-youngkin-vetoes-bill-mandating-state-environmental-justice-council-vacancies-be-filled/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it the day prior to making his previous additions. After enough members were added to attain a quorum to vote on items, the council approved its 2023 report earlier this year, which provided an update on environmental justice initiatives for the state to take up as mostly incomplete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Travis Voyles recently presented to the board in person on the state&#8217;s efforts to fund flood resiliency projects, which members of the Hobson Village in the Hampton Roads area have consistently called for at EJ council meetings. A representative for VDOT also discussed public engagement opportunities for roadway projects.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A third-party report commissioned by Mountain Valley Pipeline developers has found the cause of a test failure in May was due to a manufacturer defect and not corrosion issues, a concern environmental advocates have continuously raised about the project that took about a decade to complete before coming online earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_num=20240829-5151" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from DNV GL USA, found that a manufacturing “buttwelding” for the .7-inch thick elbow fitting installed in June 2018 blew before the hydrostatic </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/08/mountain-valley-pipeline-segment-ruptures-during-test/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reached desired pressure, weeks before the project went into service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From a manufacturing perspective, the failed fitting had a &#8216;sister&#8217; fitting in the same test section that was proactively removed from the pipeline and used to provide material for a portion of the mechanical testing aspect of the failure analysis,” wrote Justin Trettlel, in an letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accompanying the report. “There were only two fittings with matching pedigree, neither of which remains in the pipeline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 303-mile Mountain Valley Pipeline went </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/14/mountain-valley-pipeline-goes-into-service-starts-delivering-gas-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in June with the capacity to deliver up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica Shales of West Virginia into Pittsylvania County in Southwest Virginia. First announced in 2014, the project faced mounting legal troubles over environmental issues until West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin included in a federal spending plan a provision to greenlight the project to completion and end any legal disputes until it is built.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups said those delays caused possible corrosion issues with the pipe, as a result of laying out of the ground and exposed to the elements for years. But, the analysis from DNV that involved visually inspecting the pipe and  metallurgical tests found that the failure was “a result of ductile overload,” meaning the pipe’s strength was exceeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was no evidence of external or internal corrosion,” the report states underneath a picture of the ruptured pipe. “The external coating was adhered except for some portions adjacent to the fracture surfaces that disbanded due to the rupture.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of DNV GL USA report)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of the test failure, a Mountain Valley Pipeline spokeswoman said that “disruption of this one hydrotest does, in fact, demonstrate that the testing process is working as designed and intended.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Russell Chisholm, co-director of the Protect Our Water, Heritage, Rights Coalition (POWHR), a group staunchly opposed to the project, said in a statement the report comes after “four months of waiting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a pathetically predictable outcome; we know the MVP has used shoddy materials for their rushed construction job on this massive methane pipeline project,” Chisholm said. “This is yet more evidence of the threat MVP poses to everyone along the route, and why the government never should have greenlit this corrupt project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pipeline had received a consent </span><a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/2023-10/PHMSA%20Consent%20Agreement%20and%20Order%20-%20Equitrans%20Midstream.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Material Administration over safety concerns prior to starting service, but the agency said it had “no objections” if FERC approved the project starting. In July, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/07/24/va-fines-mountain-valley-pipeline-for-environmental-violations-after-another-quarterly-review/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mountain Valley $30,500 for erosion and sediment issues that predated the commencing of the project.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy decided last week to build its proposed natural gas plant at its former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station in Chesterfield County, instead of at an entirely new site, but community concerns remain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said the utility made the decision to move the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center proposal from the initial James River Industrial Park location on Battery Brooke Parkway after receiving community feedback. The power station site will “limit construction and operations to the existing industrial footprint and minimize impacts to wetlands and cultural resources,” wrote Slayton, adding the existing site already has needed infrastructure in place and will meet air quality protection requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For these reasons, we are confident the project meets all site suitability requirements under Virginia law,” Slayton said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is being put forward alongside several of Dominion’s renewable energy projects to meet surging energy demands from extreme weather events, the proliferation of data centers and increasing electrification of everyday life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in light of the Virginia Clean Economy Act — a law requiring Dominion to transition to renewable energy sources by 2045 unless there is a concern over grid reliability — and after Democratic </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/15/democratic-legislators-oppose-dominions-proposed-chesterfield-natural-gas-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spoke out against it, local residents continue to be opposed to the 1,000 megawatt project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community members have said they want more energy efficiency and storage projects developed. Residents also want a public hearing for the Chesterfield Board of Supervisors to take a formal vote to determine if the location meets “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/05/dominion-chesterfield-county-weigh-site-suitability-for-natural-gas-plant-proposal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">site suitability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” requirements, which hasn’t happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, county staff  decided a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/18/chesterfield-county-decides-to-not-take-up-zoning-appeal-for-dominions-natural-gas-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conditional use permit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued in 2010 for the existing Chesterfield Power Station on Coxendale Road would be applicable to the new plant, meaning the county won’t need to make further approvals or hold public hearings on the matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion referenced that decision in their statement about the plant’s location change and  provided that zoning determination to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality as part of the air permit approval process, but “a site suitability determination has not yet been made,” agency spokeswoman Irina Calos said in an email Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Friends of the Chesterfield, a group formed to oppose the plant, sent a letter on Tuesday to the county supervisors  asking for an on-the-record vote of site suitability by its Sept. 25 meeting. Otherwise, the group will hold its own “People’s Hearing” on Oct. 29 to gather testimony to be submitted to DEQ and the State Corporation Commission, the state’s utility regulators, in future approval processes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Board has the right and responsibility to solicit, interpret and honor the perspectives of your constituents,” the Tuesday letter states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicole Martin, president of the Chesterfield NAACP, said in a joint statement with the Southern Environmental Law Center, also on Tuesday, that “Dominion’s decision-making thus far has taken place in back rooms with little to no input from community members that will have to live with pollution from this facility every day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How it has handled this is not good. It’s unethical,” Martin continued. “It gets to the heart of how environmental injustice starts and persists – locking people and communities out of decisions that greatly impact all aspects of their lives.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Next steps</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plant’s location change prompted Dominion to modify its air permit application with DEQ, which is expected to release a draft version by the end of the year. It’s unclear how the new location may impact the amount of pollution the plant is expected to produce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since there was no permit actually drafted for the initial location, Calos, with DEQ, said “w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e are unable to determine how it would differ.” Mike Dowd, director of DEQ’s air and renewable energy division, previously told the Mercury modeling “might change.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the initial permit </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/topics-of-interest/dominion-chesterfield-energy-reliability-center-project" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the plant, with four natural gas combustion turbines, was projected to emit 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, 81.6 tons of particular matter and 344.9 tons of nitrous oxides annually, among several other pollutants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brennan Gilmore, executive director of Clean Virginia, a group that was formed to oppose Dominion’s influence in the state legislature and that has been organizing opposition to the project alongside the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Halting this project is crucial to keeping utility bills in check and protecting Chesterfield residents from decades of dangerous air pollution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The release of the new permit by DEQ will be followed by a public comment period and multiple public hearings, as well as an application with the SCC early next year to get final approval for the project. Dominion said it will also hold at least two additional public meetings, “in the coming weeks and months.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility, aware of the fierce opposition to the project, countered that it will be a necessary and reliable source of electricity for local residents and Central Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We respect their views and will continue working as hard as we can to address their concerns,” said Slayton.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A do not drink water advisory is in effect for customers of the Rapidan Service Authority that serves the central Piedmont area of the state, including Orange County, because of an odor emanating from the water. But the question remains: what’s causing the smell?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/drinking-water/wilderness-water-treatment-plant-contamination/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Virginia Department of Health and RSA had initially issued a do not use water advisory, including a ban on swimming in the Rapidan River, out of an abundance of caution, after residents reported the odor in their tap water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The odor, reported to smell like diesel, lead to a concern that oil had leaked into the Rapidan, which flows into the Rappahannock River and is the source of water treated at the Wilderness Treatment Plant before it&#8217;s sent out to customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, following “comprehensive water sampling,” VDH had found that there were no volatile organic compounds — those found in fuel and household products — causing the concerning odor and that drinking water remains in compliance with federal and state drinking water standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the do not drink advisory will stay in place “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">until the odor of concern is lessened to a greater level,” said Brookie Crawford, risk communications manager at VDH on Monday. “The comprehensive lab sampling performed to date (does) not indicate a public health risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brent Hunsinger, director of advocacy and coastal programs of the Friends of the Rappahannock, an environmental nonprofit focused on conservation of the Rappahannock River, said there haven’t been any dead fish observed or discoloration of the water. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That lack of ecosystem impact means the source of the odor could be coming from infrastructure within the wastewater treatment plant itself, but no source or chemical has been identified there either, Hunsigner said, based on his conversations with those familiar with the response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s kind of a vexing problem,” said Hunsinger, adding that the time it&#8217;s taking to solve the mystery is due in part to a 48-hour test period needed for the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDH planned another inspection of the facility on Monday, Crawford said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“RSA advises customers who still detect an odor to flush their taps,” said Dwayne Roadcap, director of the office of drinking water. “The investigation to identify the source of the odor and what is causing the odor continues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents who smell the odor in their water may report it using </span><a href="https://www.rapidan.org/contact-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on RSA’s website. </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy is spending $17.65 million for another piece of the ocean to expand its offshore wind energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s largest utility was the lone bidder for the lease of 176,506 acres about 35 miles off the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay in a Bureau of Ocean Energy Management auction Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The win means Dominion Energy has the potential to produce up to another 4 gigawatts of electricity, enough to power up to 1.4 million homes, directly adjacent to its $9.8 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project currently being </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/24/as-offshore-wind-installation-rises-dominion-showcases-environmental-economic-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">built</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The additional lease area also means Dominion is closer to — and could actually satisfy — part of its requirements of the Virginia Clean Economy Act to produce a total of 5.2 gigawatts of offshore wind electricity by 2035. The 2020 law seeks to decarbonize the electric grid by mid-century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new area also joins a 40,000-acre area, renamed CVOW South, off the coast of the Outer Banks in North Carolina that the utility announced in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/08/dominion-to-purchase-second-offshore-wind-lease-area-off-coast-of-north-carolina/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would purchase to produce up to 800 megawatts of electricity as part of an effort to meet increasing power demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That demand is coming from data centers proliferating in Virginia, surrounding states retiring fossil fuel sources, localities in Virginia pushing back against solar and battery storage sources, and problems with the regional grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As questions shroud the viability of lofty small modular nuclear reactors to provide around-the clock, carbon-free electricity generation, the ability for offshore wind to provide power by cranking its spinning turbines has become increasingly appealing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Offshore wind is critical to our all-of-the-above approach to meet the unprecedented growth of our customer electric demand over the next decade,&#8221; said Robert M. Blue, chair, president and chief executive officer of Dominion Energy. &#8220;Winning this lease area gives us another low-cost option to meet that growing demand while providing our customers with reliable, affordable and increasing clean energy.&#8221;</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The bidding</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion spent about $1.7 million in 2013 for the 113,000-care area about 27-miles off the shore of Virginia Beach being used for the CVOW project, which will consist of 176 wind-turbines — the points of which will be 836 above the water — on monopile foundations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final price for the second area is a good one, said Eileen Woll, offshore wind energy program director at the Virginia Chapter of the environmental non-profit Sierra Club, after some predicted the sale could go for as much as $200 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A reason for the price concern is because the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which runs the auctions for the areas it designates as suitable for offshore wind development, whittled the options down to two. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second lease area auctioned Wednesday, a 101,443 acre spot off the coast of Maryland and Delaware, had five opening bids at the minimum $10,144,300 price, but escalated to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $75,001,001 offer from Equinor Wind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That price, $17 million is a bargain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” said Woll in an interview, adding third party developers saw an opportunity in the northern Maryland and Delaware area. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it’s real legit for us to push [for a goal of] 8 gigawatts [of offshore wind] and it’s very realistic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the most recent legislative session, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, introduced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/01/virginia-bill-to-let-non-utilities-supply-offshore-wind-energy-pushed-back-to-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow Dominion to procure its offshore wind electricity from a third-party developer, which argued the steep competition for the limited sites could escalate bids, but the legislation was pushed to 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The argument centered around the idea that if Dominion was forced to buy electricity from one of those developers, the third-party providers would have to compete to keep their bids low as part of an overall effort to keep electricity costs down when entering into an agreement with the utility, instead of allowing Dominion to increase its bid to an exorbitant amount that is recoverable by ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the third party developers ended up not bidding on the area Dominion won and instead focused on the northern area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evan Vaughan, executive director of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition (MAREC) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Action, in a statement said, the results show that policy and electricity demands are “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attracting major interest from our growing industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It isn&#8217;t surprising to see the different level of competition between [the Virginia area] and [Maryland/Delaware] area, as Virginia&#8217;s policies do not allow for non-utility developers to sell electricity directly into the Virginia market,” he added.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s next</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility will have to submit an application to the State Corporation Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the second offshore wind project before constructing its own facility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this time, the company does not have an estimated timeline or cost for development of either CVOW South or the new leasehold,” Dominion’s release stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has attributed the “on-time and on-budget” work underway currently at CVOW to regulated oversight from the SCC that required the utility to lock up contracts years ago before inflation and supply chain issues led to third-party projects in New England states closing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The utility announced on Monday the 50th monopile of CVOW had been installed for the project that is expected to cost ratepayers $4 a month over the life of the 35-year project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lawsuit from conservative and fossil-fuel funded groups challenging the CVOW project, alleging a harm to the North Atlantic right whale that scientists dispute, is still proceeding in District of Columbia U.S. District Court. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virgnia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission is considering how to spend $12 million for energy projects as part of a legislative mandate to revitalize the economy of two regions no longer reaping the economic benefits of the tobacco industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a meeting last week, the commisisons’ Energy Ingenuity Committee discussed applications it has received for two rounds of the funds that opened up this year. A third round is expected to open after the next meeting in September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We rolled it out earlier this year,” said Jerry Silva, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">director of regional energy development and innovation at the commission, during the meeting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We really did not know what the application level would be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Energy Ingenuity </span><a href="https://revitalizeva.org/2024/06/24/6-24-25-tobacco-commission-launches-second-round-of-energy-ingenuity-fund/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was recently created by the commission to spur economic activity around energy development projects, and join a suite of other funding programs for Southside and Southwest Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission was formed in 1999 with 28 legislative and citizen members who represent the two regions and allocate funds from what is called the 1998 Master Settlement, which forced tobacco companies to compensate localities in several states for the health and economic costs associated with smoking, but also sparked the demise of the industry’s footprint in the two Virginia regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Energy Ingenuity Fund allocated $6 million to each region and solicited projects. Requirements include applicants be a government entity or nonprofit, have one-for-one matching funds and identify the number of jobs that could be created. Private companies can apply for the funds as long as it partners with a locality to create economic incentives. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The applications</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund works with a “pre-application” phase, in which applicants present ideas to Silva on what funding could go toward, before staff determine what needs more information and what can be submitted as a full application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In round one, announced in January, Silva said he received 17 pre-applications requesting a total of $27 million. Three moved forward for a full commission vote in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Agricultural Technology Innovation Partnership Foundation (ATIP), an agricultural group focused on technology development, was awarded $50,000 to plan for future </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/06/does-virginias-renewable-future-have-space-for-alternative-forms-of-gas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biomass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operations in Southwest Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission also awarded a $2 million loan to Hitachi, which manufactures transformers in South Boston and had submitted the application to upgrade equipment and avoid outsourcing. The company, which in </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/october/name-940967-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced a $37 million investment that included other commission funds, said 30 jobs would be created in its application.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hitachi Energy has a long and productive relationship with the Commonwealth of Virginia and we are grateful for this collaboration,” said Hitachi spokesperson Kurt Steinert, who declined to share more specifics and if the offer was accepted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the applicants that didn’t advance to a commission vote in round one, was Appalachian Voices, an environmental nonprofit that’s been staunchly opposed to the Mountain Valley Pipeline delivering natural gas into Pittsylvania County and is a proponent of renewable energy development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In round </span><a href="https://revitalizeva.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FINAL-FY25-Southern-VA-Energy-Fund-RFP-6-18-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 11 organizations put in requests for a total of about $4.5 million. About four projects, including an electric vehicle charging demonstration and a  waste to energy proposal are expected to be passed to the commission on Thursday, which will vote in September after the public has had an opportunity to review proposals, Silva said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The waste to energy proposal, from ATIP again, is a $1 million request for a live demonstration of mobile technology that could convert cow manure into natural gas, similar to what Roanoke Gas Company is doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We go into regions, we help educate,” said Wes Jurey, president and CEO of ATIP, in an interview on his organization&#8217;s work to study what’s needed for a biomass industry in the regions.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What type of energy?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of the funds come amid concerns that there are not enough sources of energy generation as demand from data centers and electric vehicles grow. At the same time, the state’s decarbonization goals, including the Virginia Clean Economy Act, is leading to the retirement of fossil fuel generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t stress enough the importance of what we’re going to face in the Commonwealth in the coming five to 10 years,” said James Campos, executive director of the commission, during the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a transition to electric vehicles, Downtown Wytheville, a community development organization, is seeking a $30,000 grant to continue the EV charging demonstration plans it had as part of a downtown revitalization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The town is also seeking a $50,000 planning grant for a contractor who can evaluate energy efficiency improvements, ranging from potential upgrades of sewer pumps, creation of a town electric grid or activating an old landfill to capture </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/01/federal-government-awards-150-million-to-reduce-emissions-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">methane gas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said Charlie Jones, administrative and events coordinator with Downtown Wytheville. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those efforts could combat the town’s rising Appalachian Power Company electricity bills. The bills were about $900,000 in 2021 to 2022, increased to about $1.2 million the following year and had already reached that amount in the July 1, 2023 to March 2024, timeframe, Jones said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a lot of Inflation Reduction Act [money coming] into rural areas now,” Jones said. “We’re trying to set us up,” to be “intentional.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silva said projects sought after are those fitting an “All of the Above” approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are projects that we’re trying to help bridge opportunities that would normally not be opportunities unless we helped them,” Silva said. “We’re trying to make sure we’re the best stewards of the commission&#8217;s money and dollars. We want to fund viable projects.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Del. Thomas Garrett, R-Goochland, who chairs the Energy Ingenuity Committee, said his work on the committee is not about “favoring” an energy project “over another.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My job on the commission is to create jobs and economic opportunity inside the footprint,” Garrett said, referencing the historical downturn of other industries in the region including furniture and coal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, the fund’s dollars provide “an opportunity to further enhance the energy infrastructure and supply chain across the Commonwealth,” said Braden Croy, program director at The Dominion Energy Innovation Center, which hosted a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRSAsw6UcRw&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawEoeo9leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHWDOZwavjA34MDcAa6gim3Hou4TkHyk7GWB5xvGrWi8bYaP9GlOwhZvMPA_aem_BbEfO_hJv0XFJATrnMfPWA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">webinar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the process with Silva.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As an organization focused on helping Virginia achieve a net-zero carbon economy, we&#8217;re pleased that the Tobacco Commission has earmarked funding to high-impact energy projects, and we&#8217;re looking forward to seeing the community benefits from this program,” Croy said.</span></p>

(Courtesy of John Tippet)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think back to being a kid, and imagine how cool it would have been to find a shark tooth in the sand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One island in Virginia with a collection of those fossils from the ocean’s top predator may be gone in a matter of decades, preventing future generations from making such discoveries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started going to Shark Tooth Island when I was 12 years old, hunting shark teeth,” said John P. Tippett, an adjunct professor at the University of Mary Washington. “I&#8217;ve seen that island disappear over my lifespan. It&#8217;s a dramatic change from what it was like when I was younger.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tippett and Kate Stoneman, a rising junior and research assistant at UMW, are trying to predict when the island in the Potomac River — formally named Hollis Island but colloquially called Shark Tooth Island — will disappear, and why. They say climate change is a key factor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a local landmark that people love to visit,” said Stoneman. “I want to show them that climate change is going to affect you on this personal level, whether you like it or not, because it&#8217;s what’s happening.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Barrier islands</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About an hour east of Fredericksburg near Westmoreland State Park, the private Shark Tooth Island is a barrier island, much like the Outer Banks and northeastern parts of Virginia’s Eastern Shores. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barrier islands are formed by tides and wind patterns pushing sand in certain areas that build up into a sandbar that eventually becomes big enough to be an island. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sand that forms the island picks up the teeth lost by smaller sharks, which in the Potomac River can include dogfish and bull </span><a href="https://potomac.org/blog/2024/1/2/how-the-potomac-shapes-local-wildlife" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sharks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hence the island’s nickname.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39562" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:709px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39562" rel="attachment wp-att-39562"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39562" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shark-teeth.jpg" alt="" width="709" height="945" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shark-teeth.jpg 709w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shark-teeth-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A collection of teeth on Shark Tooth Island.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the drifty nature of how barrier islands are formed, they can quickly disappear. If the island vanishes, then a natural resource that serves as a recreation spot and can also  maintain water quality and coastlines by absorbing wave energy to prevent tides from causing erosion, will be gone, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, barrier islands are disappearing at an alarming rate,” according to the </span><a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/barrier-islands.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The causes</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tippett and Stonemen are looking at the loss of the island from two angles: sea level rise and the land subsidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans burning fossil fuels that release heat-trapping greenhouse gasses are heating up global temperatures and contributing to rising waters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is going to melt our land ice, melt our glaciers,” Stoneman said. “Also, heating up our atmosphere, it&#8217;s going to warm up our oceans. As water heats up, it starts to expand. That&#8217;s also going to increase the volume in the ocean.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the land sinking aspect, humans are involved, too: they pull water out of the Potomac Aquifer, the pool of groundwater below the earth&#8217;s surface in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sediment is now compacting down into that space that water used to be in,” Stoneman said. “This is coming from industries, agriculture, coastal wells all sucking water out of our aquifers faster than the recharge rate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, last but not least, the sinking  island is a phenomenon of glacial isostatic adjustment, “kind of a mouthful term,” Stoneman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the last ice age, there was a giant ice sheet covering northern North America from Canada down into around Pennsylvania, not where the island is itself,” said Stoneman. He explained that the heavy ice sheet pushed land in the north down, which forced land on the coast up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When that ice sheet eventually melted, the land in the north then wanted to readjust back to where it used to sit,” Stoneman continued. “The land where the island is on the coast is now going to sink back down.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The research</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tippet and Stoneman’s research included compiling previous findings, figuring out how much land has already been lost and conducting their own field work, which involved tromping around the island in waders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/cir1392" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the United States Geological Survey found that Shark Tooth Island was being lost to sea level rise at a rate of about 1.8 millimeters a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional data from that USGS study, which examined the water levels of the Potomac Aquifer, found that the land Shark Tooth Island sits on was subsiding at a rate of 2.1 millimeters a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining those two figures equals a total water level increase of about 3.9 millimeters a year, or “1.5 inches every 10 years,” Stoneman said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39573" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:628px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39573" rel="attachment wp-att-39573"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39573" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-shark-tooth-video-pic-COLLAGE.jpg" alt="" width="628" height="628" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-shark-tooth-video-pic-COLLAGE.jpg 628w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-shark-tooth-video-pic-COLLAGE-300x300.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-shark-tooth-video-pic-COLLAGE-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 628px) 100vw, 628px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Photographs of Shark Tooth Island in 2024 in the top left, 2013 in the top right, 2009 in the bottom left and 1994 in the bottom right. (Courtesy of Kate Stoneman)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As verification of the land loss, Stoneman added she reviewed pictures of the island from 1994 to 2024, calculated how much vegetation each one had and found that in those 30 years, the island lost about 32.4 acres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was kind of the big start for our project to really show that the island is getting so much smaller,” Stoneman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, to calculate the year when the island will be fully submerged, Stoneman and a classmate went out on the island for three hours in October and then with another classmate for one hour in May, armed with a theodolite, the surveying tool that can usually be seen along roadways, and a long poll to find the highest point of the island.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39564" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:709px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39564" rel="attachment wp-att-39564"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39564" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/phragmites.jpg" alt="" width="709" height="945" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/phragmites.jpg 709w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/phragmites-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Kate Stoneman and another student walk into Shark Tooth Island. (Courtesy of John Tippett)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But unlike surveying flat, paved roadways, the two students had to walk into the vegetation consisting of the invasive species phragmites that they needed to  push down with the collapsible pole. Then they had to deal with pollen, avoid an old hunting blind and an old building and make their way out of the tree line before getting to a clearing to take the measurements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I asked for a machete. Mr. Tippet did not provide me with one,” Stoneman said. “It was a lot, but it was important. It was important to what we were doing, so it was going to get done</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">So what’s the answer?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re crunching the numbers,” Tippet said, adding that the highest points of elevation they found were a “few inches” above mean high tide, the highest point the water rises to before receding back into the ocean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And…we&#8217;re looking at a relative sea level rise rate of an inch and a half every 10 years,” he continued. “So you can kind of get a sense from that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A complicating factor is the dynamic nature of barrier islands. Increasingly intense rainfall may push more dirt out into the ocean that will “maybe” allow the island to shoal back up, but the sea level rise rate may increase and consume the island at a faster rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But clearly, looking at the data right now, the island&#8217;s losing,” said Tippett. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39565" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:740px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39565" rel="attachment wp-att-39565"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39565" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/beach-dune-loss-coastal-resilience-master-plan.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="963" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/beach-dune-loss-coastal-resilience-master-plan.jpg 740w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/beach-dune-loss-coastal-resilience-master-plan-231x300.jpg 231w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map from the Virginia Coastal Resilience Master Plan showing projected loss of beaches and dunes in the state. (Courtesy of Virginia Coastal Resilience Master Plan)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials are aware of the loss of barrier islands, marshes and dunes. Prior to the creation of a Chief Resilience Officer this past legislative session to better coordinate flooding matters, the state produced The Virginia Coastal Resilience Master Plan, which is due to be updated at the end of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2080, the loss of beach and dune features, including those in the Eastern Shore region, is “projected to reach 3,800 acres, a 38% loss of existing habitat,” according to the </span><a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/crmp/document/virginiacoastalresiliencemasterplan-print.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39561" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1260px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39561" rel="attachment wp-att-39561"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39561 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/presenting.jpg" alt="" width="1260" height="945" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/presenting.jpg 1260w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/presenting-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/presenting-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/presenting-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1260px) 100vw, 1260px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Kate Stoneman, second from left, presents her research alongside fellow University of Mary Washington student Holly Anthony, left, to Shark Tooth Island goers</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the research isn’t quite intended to influence policy at the moment, Tippet said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a whole lot of misinformation, a whole lot of folks who believe [climate change isn’t] not real, or not that bad,” Tippet said. “What we&#8217;re doing here is trying to address that part. We can&#8217;t make change at the policy level until the people who vote actually are behind it.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regional electric grid that supplies power to Virginia during times of extreme weather announced a 1,400% increase in some electric costs after its most recent capacity auction. But Dominion officials were quick to assure customers that they would not see an increase in their bills before the end of next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM Interconnection, which oversees the electric grid serving several mid-Atlantic states, including Virginia, announced the increase for its capacity market. Dominion buys electricity off of capacity markets during peak, or emergency, demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release, PJM blamed the increase on the need to meet surging electricity demand, which is coming from data centers, and electrification of vehicles and home appliances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those needs also come amid the retirement of generation sources, PJM officials noted. State’s around the region have implemented policy goals to take offline older, fossil fuel sources to decarbonize electric grids. Virginia has a target to do so by mid-century as a way to combat increasing storm intensities caused by climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understanding the capacity market begins with knowing that Dominion owns generation sources to provide the electricity it transmits and distributes throughout its grid. Dominion also purchases electricity from a separate wholesale market, which is where third-party power producers sell the electricity they create.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when the grid experiences high demands of electricity, such as winter and summer when either heaters or AC systems are cranking, the utility may have to purchase electricity from the capacity market to meet its obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The auction prices, which are set for future periods to give the third-party power producers an idea of how much they could make and whether it’s feasible to keep their sources online, were recently set for the broader PJM region at $269.20 for 2025-26. For sources within Dominion territory, they were set at $444.26 per megawatt, and in Baltimore Gas and Electric territory at $466.35 because of a limited number of them and transmission constraints. </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/about-pjm/newsroom/2023-releases/20230227-pjm-capacity-auction-procures-adequate-resources.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the price for the PJM region, which then included Dominion’s territory, was $28.92 per megawatt. The highest cost for other constrained areas, those with limited generation sources and transmission lines, in the previous auction was $96.24.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The significantly higher prices in this auction confirm our concerns that the supply/demand balance is tightening across the RTO,” said PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana in a </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/about-pjm/newsroom/2024-releases/20240730-pjm-capacity-auction-procures-sufficient-resources-to-meet-rto-reliability-requirement.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The market is sending a price signal that should incent investment in resources.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The costs to customers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion, on its investor earnings </span><a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/01/dominion-energy-d-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week, said that the utility shouldn’t be impacted too much by the capacity market increase because those purchases only account for about 1% of current customer bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current rates, which on average are about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$128</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a residential customer, are locked in until Dominion undergoes its next rate review next year. That means Dominion will bear any increased capacity market costs from June until rates change at the end of 2025, said Steven D. Ridge, executive vice president and chief financial officer on the earnings call. And, since Dominion sells power it produces into the wholesale market, any capacity market purchases has a “natural hedge” by those sales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ll have offshore wind come in, we&#8217;ll have the Chesterfield [natural gas combustion turbines] come in,” said Ridge, speaking to generation sources that could come online. “But demand is growing. So as that persists, we&#8217;ll think about ways to become effectively self-sufficient as we have been in the past as we catch up on demand. But from a financial impact, it truly is just a temporary item.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concern over grid reliability is why Dominion is proposing the 1,000 megawatt natural gas plant in Chesterfield County, as well as a natural gas storage tank to supply other </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/business/dominion-energy-plans-500-million-liquid-natural-gas-storage-facility/article_18d5e3b0-3f8e-11ef-a4bf-336255a2a35d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.loudoun.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/13796" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transmission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> line projects to deliver power from various sources. It is also seeking proposals to design a small modular nuclear reactor. Those developments come alongside Dominion’s continued buildout of offshore wind, some solar projects and long duration energy storage devices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia needs more reliable power generation and new transmission infrastructure to reliably serve the growing needs of our customers,” Dominion spokesperson Aaron Ruby told the Mercury after the earning’s call, while adding that additional generation sources, “will be evaluated in our 2024 [Integrated Resource Plan] this October.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One environmental group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/cost-slow-walking-clean-energy-pjm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s the unreliability of natural gas that contributed to the rising prices in the capacity market auction. That concern stems from natural gas delivery systems </span><a href="https://stateline.org/2023/11/23/a-year-after-devastating-winter-storm-power-plant-problems-still-likely-in-extreme-weather/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">freezing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during Winter Storm Elliot in 2022, said Claire Lang-Ree, advocate, sustainable FERC project, climate &amp; energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Natural gas] actual added value is kind of diminished, considering some constraints,” said Lang-Ree. “I think it also points to the benefits of a diverse resource mix — being able to have not only storage, but also onshore and offshore wind. Offshore wind has a really high capacity factor and can provide reliability when there&#8217;s big winter storms or places where the rest of the grid is experiencing outages.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM has been criticized for a large backlog of solar generation sources waiting to come online across the grid. The approval process has undergone reforms, but elected officials said PJM should also adopt some cost-saving measures outlined in a recent order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission aimed at improving regional planning for transmission lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no time to waste in planning for the transmission system to support our future energy needs,” said a </span><a href="https://www.ncelenviro.org/app/uploads/2024/07/FINAL-Sign-on-Letter-for-Transmission-Planning-at-PJM.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the officials, which included Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while Virginia’s regulators have noted a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/03/dominion-gets-approval-for-solar-projects-regulators-discuss-data-center-demand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the capabilities of solar to provide electricity generation to meet capacity needs, since the amount of electricity a solar panel produces isn’t always at its fullest potential, Lang-Ree acknowledged there are other steps Dominion can also take to add capacity. Those include pursuing more power purchase agreements with third party generators, which environmental groups say Dominion should do more of because of their lower cost to provide electricity, in addition to allowing some buildings to </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07052024/virginia-connecting-renewable-energy-to-grid/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interconnect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solar panels to alleviate their strain on the grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When prices are this high, small amounts of [megawatts] can make huge cost differences,” Lang-Ree said.</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story has been updated to reflect that the average Dominion customer&#8217;s bill is $128, not $133 as previously reported.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Virginia began its early discussion on draft regulations for septic systems, which are a typical method of treating waste in areas not privy to public infrastructure, as part of a 20-year regulatory review that kicked off in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/20/amid-climate-change-pressures-virginia-reexamines-septic-regulations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of opening up the regulations for review, there were about 1.1 million septic systems in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A majority of the systems are conventional, meaning wastewater from a residence is sent to a tank on the property before it is filtered through a distribution box that sends it throughout the property. The waste eventually breaks down as it is dispersed into the environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative systems, which include creating mounds that add more dirt for waste to filter through and chemical treatments, also exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, pollution protections include setbacks, which require conventional systems be at least 70 feet away from waters with shellfish. Ideally, the setbacks allow  flooding to occur without overwhelming the system, so waste doesn’t back up onto properties or immediately feed into larger bodies of water where shellfish are living.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not just a public health problem, it’s an economic problem,” Skip Stiles, former director of environmental nonprofit Wetlands Watch, said in a previous interview with the Mercury, referencing how the spreading of pollutants can harm aquaculture, or the raising of shellfish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=meeting%5C58%5C40105%5CMinutes_VDH_40105_v1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> call for the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences, VIMS, to create a map of a “critical impact area” that is more susceptible to sea level rise and groundwater flooding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within those areas, among other setback requirements, conventional systems would have to be 100 feet away from shellfish waters, unless alternative measures can be incorporated to allow for treatment with more flexibility when siting systems on smaller properties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During last month’s meeting, no member of the subgroup consisting of state, regional and local government employees and environmental groups objected to the proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Stiles, speaking on behalf of Wetlands Watch, raised the question of how to identify critical impact areas with rising water tables, which delineates where groundwater begins to pool in deeper parts of the Earth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some areas, sea level rise and groundwater flooding cause that water table to rise, but the soil hasn’t formed into conditions to mark out water tables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We run into the same problem with wetlands delineation; it requires vegetation inundation of </span><a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-basics/natural-resource-concerns/soil/hydric-soils#:~:text=A%20hydric%20soil%20is%20a,conditions%20in%20the%20upper%20part." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hydric soils</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Stiles said. “But in some of the newly created wetlands, because of sea level rise, the hydric soils haven&#8217;t formed yet. We have some tidal wetlands that are not tidal wetlands, because they are waiting for the hydric soils to form.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lance Gregory, director of the Virginia Department of Health’s Division of Onsite Water and Wastewater Services, acknowledged “there’d be a lot of difficulties in making that determination,” but that he was “open to ideas…that could be done consistently.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group is expected to meet again Aug. 22 to continue working on the initial ideas.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is the recipient of two federal grants to capture climate changing emissions, one focused on methane and another on promoting natural solutions to capture carbon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funds, about $150 million, are from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program, created by the Inflation Reduction Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nvestments such as this are paramount to ensuring communities across the region who are impacted the most have access to reduced climate and air pollution,&#8221; said EPA Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Adam Ortiz. “We need our partners to help us in tackling climate challenges.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s funding is funneled through the Department of Environmental Quality, which is primarily working with Virginia Energy to use about $99.9 million towards methane capture from mined lands, and the Department of Wildlife Resources, to use $50 million on the land preservation component. The awarding to DWR is also part of a collaborative effort with the state of North Carolina that received a total of $421 million, with about $47.2 million going to The Nature Conservancy’s operations in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ said the state’s methane capture component could reduce 25 million tons of greenhouse gasses by 2050. The Nature Conservancy estimates about 28 million tons of GHGs — the same amount produced by about 6.6 million cars — will be captured between 2025 and 2050 through regional partnership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are intended to achieve immediate emission reductions in the short term,” said Tom Ballou, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">air data analysis &amp; planning </span>director<span style="font-weight: 400;"> at DEQ.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Minimizing methane</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About $80 million of the methane capture funding will boost efforts already underway by current mining operations and abandoned mined lands project developers  to remove the most potent greenhouse gas, which is 28 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of capturing methane — which is released during active mining operations to relieve pressure during underground digging to prevent explosions, and that naturally emanates from closed down sites — has been </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/new-report-says-virginia-could-incentivize-methane-capture-from-coal-mines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discussed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia for at least a couple years. The EPA lists nine projects in the coalfields region of Southwest Virginia that can include capturing the methane and turning it into natural gas and flaring, or burning it.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QrYd2b89TH"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/new-report-says-virginia-could-incentivize-methane-capture-from-coal-mines/">New report says Virginia could incentivize methane capture from coal mines</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;New report says Virginia could incentivize methane capture from coal mines&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/new-report-says-virginia-could-incentivize-methane-capture-from-coal-mines/embed/#?secret=49rkzrk9Xu#?secret=QrYd2b89TH" data-secret="QrYd2b89TH" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental nonprofits have pushed back against using methane as an energy source for the broader electric grid, beyond manufacturers using it to power their operations. The groups say  converting methane to sellable natural gas would create a revenue stream for mining operations to continue and wouldn’t be a clean, zero-emissions source of electricity, like solar and wind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, with 80% of Vrignia’s coal being mined for ongoing metallurgical production of steel, the CPRG funding provides opportunities to “look at better ways” to mine, said Daniel Kestner, economic development manager at Virginia Energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know there&#8217;s a safety aspect around degassing those mines, as those workers are undergoing work, but also [an] opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create jobs in these communities that have been impacted by the downturn in the coal economy,” said Kestor, adding that requests for proposals to use the funding could go out early next year. “It&#8217;s a pretty lofty goal, but we think it can be achieved with the use of technology.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining $20 million in grants for methane capture will go toward a potential of one to three projects at landfills in the central or Southwest Virginia regions to meet LIDAC requirements. One example of a landfill capturing methane is the Southeastern Public Service Authority landfill in Suffolk, which unveiled a $25 million renewable natural gas </span><a href="https://www.whro.org/2023-10-18/spsa-landfill-renewable-natural-gas-facility" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year that collects and sells it as natural gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A portion of the $20 million will also fund food waste prevention at 15 to 20 Virginia universities, to divert food sources that are typically thrown out, despite not having expired, from ever getting to landfills and emitting methane in the first place.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A more natural approach</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to funding that will go toward the Virginia Port Authority and a Virginia Native American tribe yet to be chosen, the Department of Wildlife and The Nature Conservationy are leading Virginia’s effort to sequester carbon using forests, wetlands and peat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maintain wildlife habitat, DWR will  embark on eight projects that include shoring up about 6,000 acres of wetlands by installing breakwaters to reduce the flow of energy that can crash into and erode shorelines. Several animal species, including the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/30/frisky-little-songbird-needs-protection-from-sea-level-rise-environmental-group-tells-feds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saltmarsh Sparrow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, use coastal wetlands to migrate around the Chesapeake Bay, explained Becky Gwynn, deputy director at DWR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency will contract workers to restore about 2,500 acres of forestland in the coastal and Eastern Shore regions by removing invasive plant species and growing the Atlantic White Cedar, a tree that has long been harvested for shingles production, prior to the wood pellet industry staking a claim in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was a win-win-win all around. It addresses clearly the overall goals of the grant program by facilitating natural carbon capture, but it also really is value-added and accelerates a lot of this important habitat enhancement and restoration,” said Gwynn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nature Conservancy, an international environmental nonprofit, is also setting out to acquire land and place development-blocking easements across about 36,000 acres of forestland in Southwest Virginia, including Warm Springs Mountain in the Allegheny Highlands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TNC will also preserve Longleaf pine across 7,750 acres on the East Coast, and about 150 acres of tidal wetlands that contain peat, a dirt that can sequester twice the amount of carbon that forests can. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effort involves an analysis from Duke University and a third-party, VERRA, to validate the carbon that is stored. The TNC projects will not produce carbon credits, which companies can purchase to offset their other operations that emit greenhouse gasses, but may not result in funding going back to those communities producing the credits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bettina Ring, Virginia state director at the TNC, touted her organization’s respect for local communities and its “shared vision” of partnership with other groups to reach sustainability goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our entire organization is watching this project, we’re really excited about it, knowing it&#8217;s a game changer for biodiversity.”</span></p>

(Courtesy of Virginia Department of Forestry)</p><p>The Virginia Department of Forestry is changing how it warns people about a state fire safety law that makes burning anything before 4 p.m. illegal, by removing the physical burn ban signs along roadways and posting digital notices on the information highway of the internet, instead.</p>
<p>During the spring wildfire season each year Feb. 15 to April 30, the law forbids open air burning within 300 feet of the woods or dry grass which could carry fire to the woods, except between 4 p.m. and midnight. That information is printed on two-foot by three-foot metal signs posted along roadways statewide. Now, foresters are taking the signs down and spreading the word via informational posts on Facebook, X and the neighborhood chat forum Nextdoor.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a very specific change in methods, but nothing to do with the overall mission or importance of the message,” said State Forester Rob Farrell.</p>
<p>The signs, which began coming down this spring, were first installed about 75 years ago: on one side, there are instructions in red lettering spelling out the periodic burn ban; on the other side are the words “Keep Virginia green,” in emerald letters.</p>
<p>Before the transition to digital messaging, every year on the first day of burn ban period, a local forrester from one of the department’s field offices needed to drive around to the signs, undo two bolts, flip the sign over to the red-lettered side, clean it and make sure it’s legible. On April 30, when the burn ban period ended, a forester flipped the sign back to the other side.</p>
<p>“Every DOF local office has a map in a file, and they have a little ‘X’ where each of their signs are, so they can help themselves to remember where all the signs are. Every year, a new forester will come to an area and have to go and find where all the signs are on February 15,” Farrell said. “A county could have a dozen signs, and then you have 100 in some localities across the state. It certainly could be over 1,000 of these signs around the state.”</p>
<p>All of that flipping takes time, which Farrell said “could be better spent assisting landowners, assisting loggers, doing all of the other work that our field staff do across the state.” The practice also presented safety concerns for the foresters, Farrell said.</p>
<p>“They&#8217;re flipping metal signs on the side of rural roads, which are getting busier and busier and busier, and traffic is going faster and faster.”</p>
<p>So, why does the spring burn ban lift at 4 p.m.?</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s nothing magical about four o&#8217;clock,” said Farrell. “You just got to pick a time, but [at] four o&#8217;clock, things are starting to turn in our favor. Temperatures are going down, humidity is coming up, and wind is a little bit lighter in the evening.”</p>
<p>The digital messaging also allows the department to use a more immediate, targeted approach to deliver messages to residents of areas whose fire risk is increasing.</p>
<p>“Frankly, I think we&#8217;re all used to driving by signs every day, and they may cease to get our attention as they used to,” said Greg Bilyeu, director of communications at the department. “Also, there&#8217;s often local burn bans that are put into effect by the localities. Those can change on a dime. We can share that via NextDoor and really push that right into the community that we need to.”</p>

<p>The change comes ahead of the fall fire season Oct. 15 to Nov. 30, and as Virginia encounters wildfires that ravage a greater number of acres. Nearly 20,000 acres went up in a blaze this <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/22/fires-have-consumed-thousands-of-acres-in-virginia-this-spring-that-could-be-a-good-thing-for-the-environment/">spring</a> in Virginia, while last <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/22/all-virginia-wildfires-except-matts-creek-contained-say-officials/">fall</a> saw 12,500 acres burned. Historically, the annual average of Virginia acres burned by wildfire had been about 9,500.</p>
<p>“That is the challenge we&#8217;re facing,” Farrell said. “There are more people in the way of these fires than ever before,” Farrell said.</p>
<p>Although they are a destructive and captivating force, forest management officials have said the blazes in Virginia’s wetter climate have not been as detrimental as those in western and northern parts of the continent <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/07/26/firefighters-in-oregon-battle-biggest-blaze-in-country-with-thousands-facing-evacuation-orders/" target="_blank">this year</a> and last year.</p>

<p>The department will keep taking the signs down but it may be a while before they can get them all.</p>
<p>“I will not be surprised that we&#8217;ll continue to find signs here and there around the state that haven&#8217;t been taken down yet,” Farrell said during a phone interview, as he gazed at one of the signs. “I was a forester for seven years, so I spent my time switching signs.

(Photo by Scott Bauer/USDA Agricultural Research Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is on track to implement updated </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewXML.cfm?textid=18507" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for animal waste created by certain farming operations, despite disagreement on how to regulate older earthen lagoons that pose a greater risk of releasing pollutants into groundwater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/viewstage.cfm?stageid=10398&amp;display=documents" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the regulation changes for farmers who confine cows, pigs and more for 45 days or more within a year for dairy, eggs and meat production, as well as slaughtering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s approval comes after the citizen-member State Water Control Board OK’d at a June 25 meeting the general permit for 108 animal feed operations in the state, meaning the rules in the one permit applies to all the operations. The current general permit is set to expire Nov. 15, so the revisions will take effect Nov. 16 for another 10-year period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waste from the animals can be stored in containers, concrete structures, or earthen lagoons, which are ponds of manure that use natural and chemical processes to treat it. The operators </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/title9/agency25/chapter192/section20/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treat the waste, recycle it or apply to their land as compost, among other purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules are part of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality’s program to regulate pollution discharges to prevent harm to the environment. One concern with animal waste is a potential to release nitrogen into groundwater that can feed into waterways leading to the Chesapeake Bay, which state and federal partners are struggling to clean up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are focused on nitrogen discharges to groundwater, but bacteria would also be of concern,” said Patrick Fanning, Virginia staff attorney with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, in an email to the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also new requirements for nutrient management plans, an analysis for nitrogen and tools to determine a 100-year flood plain, or areas where groundwater can get inundated following heavy rain from intense storms likely to happen once every century and can lead to more groundwater connections that may flow up to the surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some farmers had raised concerns over costs to any changes, said Betsy Bowles, DEQ animal feeding operations inspector. But other farmers were in support of the new rules, which incorporate previously less enforceable guidance on conditions for closing a waste storage device. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving feedback from farmers and environmental groups, which primarily wanted more monitoring, DEQ didn’t make any changes to the rules, which were presented to the public in their final form for the first time at the June 25 meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Farm Bureau spoke at that meeting in support of the rules. The only other commenter, Fanning, with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, called DEQ’s decision to not make one change, &#8220;a bad take and a bad interpretation of the law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay Foundation, on behalf of several other organizations, submitted 10 requests, including requiring one groundwater monitor above and two groundwater monitors below earthen lagoons that were made before 1998. Those lagoons were grandfathered into regulations, and made without the more stringent requirements in place now, Fanning said, meaning “these are the lagoons that are most likely to be discharging to groundwater.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowle’s said DEQ interpreted the law to mean that monitoring can only be required if there is already monitoring in place, Bowles added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our understanding of the law, for being able to require more groundwater monitoring is if they are already monitoring but there is a change that we need to increase from one every three years to more frequent,” Bowles said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Fanning, in his comments to the board said DEQ’s interpretation “is simply not true,” pointing out the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title62.1/chapter3.1/section62.1-44.17:1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states DEQ “may include in the permit or nutrient management plan more frequent or additional monitoring of waste, soils or groundwater as required to protect state waters.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, he added: “How would DEQ ever know if there is a problem if they’re not requiring monitoring?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fanning sought guidance from the Attorney General’s office, but Ross Phillips, senior assistant attorney in the OAG, sided with DEQ, and certified the rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tony Banks, senior assistant director of the agriculture, development and innovation department with the Virginia Farm Bureau, said in an interview with the Mercury, his organization is supportive of DEQ’s interpretation of the law and that the older lagoons were built to engineering standards of the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we had an issue that would’ve become apparent at this point,” Banks said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ spokeswoman Irina Calos added the agency is “unaware of any complete lagoon failures at permitted farms in Virginia.” One time, during the 2004 Hurricane Gaston, floodwaters overtopped a lagoon that was in compliance with the permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In general, DEQ does visual site inspections of waste storage structures to include lagoons every three years but can and does inspect sites more frequently as needed,” Calos said, adding that if there are concerns with noncompliance DEQ can require a permittee to obtain an individual permit with groundwater monitoring requirements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The College of William &amp; Mary announced Wednesday it received the gift from philanthropist Jane Batten to rename its School of Marine Science at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences to the Batten School of Coastal &amp; Marine Sciences and bolster its resources to study a range of topics including sea level rise, increased storm intensity, loss of agricultural land and impaired water quality, issues that especially impact Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This gift propels us forward toward great promise and progress,” Batten said in a statement. “I am confident that this will spark significant change, building resilience in coastal communities in the Commonwealth and across the globe for generations to come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Award will fund climate change, coastal resilience education</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s tidewater region, consisting of wetlands, marshes and seawater environments has continuously experienced some of the highest </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/04/05/for-the-fifth-year-in-a-row-norfolk-takes-the-top-spot-for-sea-level-rise-on-the-east-coast/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of sea level rise along the East Coast, at about .2 inches per year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The overhauled school would join a collection of several other programs around the county offering marine science disciplines, but would provide a unique focus on the impact of climate change impacting coastal communities with its location on the York River in Gloucester Point, Virginia, the university says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the school offers a minor, master’s degree and two research degrees in the discipline that </span><a href="https://www.vims.edu/academics/wm_undergrad/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> marine ecosystems and what shapes them. In May, William &amp; Mary’s Board of Visitors approved creating an undergraduate marine science degree that is awaiting approval from the State Council for Higher Education in Virginia and would be offered at the Batten school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dean of the Batten School and Director of VIMS Derek Aday said in a statement the school has a “geographical advantage, expertise advantage and historical presence in this area.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also have the breadth and depth in coastal and marine systems to allow us to take on very significant challenges that other places aren’t equipped for,” said Aday. “With this unprecedented gift, we will not only advance critical research and inform policy but also train the next generation of scientists, thought leaders and engaged citizens, preparing them to navigate the complexities of global change in this century.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding will enable “infrastructure” improvements at the VIMS campus by constructing an outreach and education center alongside previously laid plans to build a new Chesapeake Bay </span><a href="https://www.vims.edu/newsandevents/topstories/2022/new_research_building.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a sea water lab. The monies would also go toward attracting scientists, researchers and students, and creating both new positions and public and private partners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The improvements made to the school, it says, will build on the university’s Vision 2026 water initiative, which included </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/07/william-mary-unveils-details-of-plan-to-replace-virginia-coastal-policy-center/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unveiling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the policy-focused Virginia Coastal Resilience Collaborative, formerly known as the Virginia Coastal Policy Center before its director resigned, last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is “no specific link between the gift and the Virginia Coastal Resilience Collaborative,” Aday said, but the gift “does strengthen our focus on coastal science, and ensures that we will be at the forefront of educating leaders equipped to take on future challenges related to coastal resilience in the face of global change.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Help with research</h4>

VIMS also created the framework for how to conduct a $2.7 million Chesapeake Bay stock assessment of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/24/latest-petition-to-reduce-omega-proteins-menhaden-catch-limit-is-rejected/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">menhaden</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the tiny nutrient-fish at the center of continual sustainability debates between recreational striped bass fishers and Omega Protein, the only menhaden reduction fishery in the Chesapeake Bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gift does not change VIMS’s advisory role to the state, nor does it change the interdisciplinary work carried out by our students, staff, and faculty,” Aday said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gift is the largest William &amp; Mary has received in its 331-year history, according to the school. In addition to propping up the marine science program, university leaders hope the funding will attract further investments from state, federal and private sources toward a goal of raising at least another $100 million.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the Southern Environmental Law Center filed a petition with federal regulators that raises pollution concerns stemming from Virginia&#8217;s issuance of an air permit to an AdvanSix Resins and Chemicals manufacturing plant in the city of Hopewell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 19, the SELC filed the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-07/advansix-petition_7-19-24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on behalf of several other environmental groups including the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mothers Out Front, the Sierra Club, Falls of the James Group and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Interfaith Power &amp; Light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The petition highlights what the groups say is a lack of information on the facility’s emissions and barriers to public involvement in the process to issue a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/50232-106-AdvanSix-Title-V-Renewal-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/50232-106-AdvanSix-Title-V-Renewal-final.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1721841945290000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3M63_6Mc97Qm4xdGl2UZf5">Title V air permit.</a> A Title V air <a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=C:/TownHall/docroot/GuidanceDocs/440/GDoc_DEQ_2183_v11.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File%3DC:/TownHall/docroot/GuidanceDocs/440/GDoc_DEQ_2183_v11.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1721841945290000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0bzLiSyt5KwLdREsprv8Uo">permit</a> is used for facilities with the potential to emit pollutants beyond state limits, and allows facilities to consolidate existing permit documents, regulators to evaluate reporting and the public to provide input.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Considering the amount of pollution that this plant emits into the surrounding community, the public should have had access to the information it needs to ensure that permit is sufficiently protective,” SELC staff attorney Patrick Anderson said in a statement. “Our air pollution laws and environmental justice require more than this permitting process provided.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdvanSix is a plastics maker with manufacturing facilities in the Virginia cities of Hopewell, and Portsmouth and Chesterfield County and outside the state in Pennsylvania and Alabama. The Hopewell facility produces ammonium sulfate for fertilizer and caprolactam for several products, including carpets. The </span><a href="https://www.advansix.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AdvanSix-2023-Sustainability-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has reported emitting nitrogen oxides, sulfuric oxides, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, particulate matter and hazardous air pollutants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1974, the facility in Hopewell that became an AdvanSix operation was responsible for a Kepone incident, which released the toxic insecticide into the James River that feeds into the Chesapeake Bay. More recently, the facility has been found to have 66 violations under both the federal Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, according to reporting from the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/hopewell-advansix-honeywell-allied-chemicals-epa-pollution/article_b986e9a6-c994-11ed-a02c-4f9e79a157db.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The petition states that a lack of specific emission data makes it difficult for the public to review the draft air permit, and that there’s a lack of effective monitoring requirements. DEQ also decided </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/advansix-hopewell-chemical-plant-permit-deq-kepone/article_37bbb50c-e20f-11ee-a833-8fab48b90264.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hold a public hearing about the facility’s permit, despite requests and comments from the public to do so, the petition states. According to the EPA’s </span><a href="https://ejscreen.epa.gov/mapper/ejscreen_SOE.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EJ Screen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a tool for determining the socioeconomic profile of areas, 48% of the people who live there are considered low-income and 57% are people of color. </span></p>
<p>According to a March 26 <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AdvanSix-TV-Public-Hearing-Memo-final-PRO-50232.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AdvanSix-TV-Public-Hearing-Memo-final-PRO-50232.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1721841945290000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ZNuFjyoNp8Ug3HnVZPUro">memo</a> from DEQ in response to comments previously submitted by the SELC, this issuance of the permit, &#8220;does not result in an increase in emissions or allow any new impacts on the Hopewell Community,&#8221; and that &#8220;extensive [potential to emit] calculations are not necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>DEQ sent an email notification of the public comment period for the Title V air permit to people who signed up for a public meeting over a water permit for the facility in September 2023, the memo adds. Since the permit would not affect or alter the facility&#8217;s existing permits or operational requirements including emission limits, &#8220;DEQ believes that additional public engagement pursuant to [the Virginia Environmental Justice Act] is not required and would not be beneficial at this time,&#8221; the memo also stated. Criteria to hold a public hearing had not been met, the memo continued.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AdvanSix, in a statement, said it wants to maintain  “an engaged and transparent working relationship” with community members, and state and federal regulators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Throughout the regulatory review process, AdvanSix made all emission data from the Hopewell facility available to the DEQ,” read the statement, which also stated data is publicly available with the EPA. “The air emission limits for the regulated emission units are listed in the permit along with monitoring equipment, which the DEQ makes available for the public to view.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SELC’s petition asks the EPA to object to the permit and direct DEQ to make information available and offer a new opportunity for public comments. The federal agency has 60 days to respond to the petition.  DEQ spokeswoman Irina Calos said this is the first time one of the agency&#8217;s Title V permits has been appealed to the EPA. Permit documents, Calos said, are &#8220;part of the record, and as such, they are available upon request.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ is also reviewing what has been deemed a “controversial permit” under Virginia Pollution Discharge Elimination System </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=meeting%5C103%5C39951%5CAgenda_DEQ_39951_v4.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Hopewell facility that would be in effect for a period of five years. Approval is expected later this year, after the company agreed to speed up the timelines for compliance as environmental groups raised concerns over the length of time the facility would have initially been given and several other issues.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn the Chevron doctrine could impact environmental protections in Virginia — or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the exact implications are unclear, attorneys with environmental organizations say the overturning could influence Virginia’s tailpipe emissions, but rules around keeping waterways clean appear to be on firmer ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no question you&#8217;re going to see more industry group challenges,” said Trip Pollard, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The doctrine</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chevron doctrine stems from a ruling that’s been in place for decades and gives deference to agencies to interpret laws as they see fit when writing regulations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Last month, SCOTUS overturned that ruling by saying when a law doesn’t clearly delineate authority, it’s up to the courts to decide how to interpret its meaning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course, when faced with a statutory ambiguity in such a case, the ambiguity is not a delegation to anybody, and a court is not somehow relieved of its obligation to independently interpret the statute,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tailpipe emissions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the environmental front, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s federal tailpipe emissions standards, expected to apply to Virginia next year, are one example of how protections could change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was set to follow California’s tailpipe regulations after Democrats passed a law in 2021 tying the state to those standards, which are stricter than the federal rules. But in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/youngkin-says-virginia-wont-follow-californias-clean-car-standards-anymore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares announced that Virginia will revert back to the federal regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the federal and California rules aim to cut down on tailpipe emissions by transitioning drivers to use electric vehicles, but environmental groups have said California’s faster pace of transition was needed to combate change. Republicans have pushed back against the transition because of the cost and lack of charging infrastructure concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal rules could be scaled back even more though with a pending lawsuit against them, and Pollard said that the removal of the Chevron doctrine impact is “immediate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/biden-tailpipe-emission-rules-shakier-ground-after-supreme-court-ruling-2024-07-01/#:~:text=In%20a%20decision%20released%20on,like%20the%20Clean%20Air%20Act." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, David Pettit, senior attorney for climate and energy with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said challengers will argue the EPA, “did not have the legal ability to decide that the Clean Air Act covers [greenhouse gas] emissions from mobile sources, because it doesn&#8217;t say that in the Clean Air Act.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Water protections</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal legislation on protecting waterways is the Clean Water Act, which gives Virginia the authority to administer regulations alongside its own laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s unclear how the authority </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/compliance/memorandum-agreements-between-epa-and-states-authorized-implement-national-pollutant" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delegated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Virginia under the CWA may be impacted without the Chevron doctrine, said Patrick Fanning, Virginia staff attorney with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But one way the CWA applies to Virginia is through enforcement of total daily maximum loads (TMDLS) or plans to clean up polluted waterways. The </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/01/22/why-stormwater-poses-an-increasing-challenge-for-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TMDLS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are seen as crucial components toward cleaning up rivers and streams that feed into the plagued Chesapeake Bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Clean Water Act clearly states that once a waterway is listed as impaired, the EPA is able to impose clean up requirements, Fanning added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of course there’s less specificity in the Clean Water Act than in the TMDL regulations, but the authority to do that is clear in the Clean Water Act,” Fanning said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, Virginia has its own State Water Control </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/state-water-control-law/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is intended to be consistent with the federal laws, but doesn’t appear to be in jeopardy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two previous cases in Virginia, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manassas Autocars, Inc., v. Couch and Commonwealth v. American Radiator &amp; Standard Sanitary Corp. in. 1960,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> give  deference to DEQ to impose regulations from that law through the rulemaking process, Fanning added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Supreme Court of Virginia basically said construction of statutes by public officials, the state agencies that are charged with administering them, is entitled to deference from the court,” Fanning said, while referencing the 1960 case.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Future changes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the removal of the Chevron doctrine, Pollard and Fanning say future federal laws will likely have specific stipulations, which may pose a challenge given Congress’ difficulty to pass a bill in general. Also, including specific regulations for toxic emissions limits may be hard if the level of toxic emissions is unknown</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When congress passes something they don’t and can’t spell out every detail,” Pollard said. “That’s why we have these agencies with expertise in particular subject matter. They have their process for public input.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of legal challenges to regulations could also skyrocket, because a six-year statute of limitations was also changed with the loss of the Chevron doctrine. Previously, new rules could only be challenged within six years of their adoption. But now, a new business entity may be able to challenge a regulation that was crafted more than six years prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it creates a lot of uncertainty about things that had otherwise been well settled,” said Fanning. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks in Virginia Beach Friday, July 18, 2024 with Virginia Manufacturers Association Brett Vassey sitting to his left. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Friday leaned into his All-of-the-Above energy plan that calls for continued use of natural gas, despite scientists stating human use of fossil fuels is causing climate change’s increasingly intense storms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need more gas. We need more solar and wind and we need nuclear and we are going to lead the nation here and that is going to be a wonderful thing to see,” Youngkin said. “I get frustrated by people who talk about ‘either-ors.’ Small minded people, in my mind, constantly drive us into the ‘either-or. We can either do this or do that.’ I firmly reject that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s comments came during a speech at the third annual Virginia Energy Summit, sponsored largely by gas companies, in Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the event, Youngkin’s speech was presented to the public as an update to his energy plan, released in October 2022. State </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title45.2/chapter17/article4/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dictates a new plan needs to be released every four years, with updates coming by Oct. 1 in the third year of a governor’s term. No formal update was provided at Friday’s event, but one is expected in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Governor’s revision to the 2022 Energy Plan will reiterate the vision he outlined two years ago and chart a path forward for Virginia to meet the unprecedented needs of Virginia&#8217;s power economy,” said spokeswoman Macaulay Porter in a statement, while touting the state’s economic activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speech came after Youngkin, previously discussed as a former vice presidential candidate, regained national attention this week by speaking at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It’s not clear if Youngkin is continuing to pursue any higher office, but in the same time period North Dakota governor, </span><a href="https://northdakotamonitor.com/2024/07/17/burgum-emphasizes-energy-dominance-during-convention-speech/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Burgum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has been floated as a potential appointee to an energy position within the administration of Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump, if he were to win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s support for natural gas is a familiar message, recently shared in Louisiana with a suite of other Republican governors who </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/06/03/republican-governors-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attacked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the energy policy of current Democratic President Joe Biden, who is also the presumed Democratic nominee for president. Biden has reiterated his commitment to the race, despite mounting calls for him to step aside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin unveiled his first energy </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/04/youngkins-energy-plan-calls-for-reevaluation-of-clean-economy-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022, which calls for using natural gas, nuclear and a revaluation of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, the 2020 landmark law that seeks to decarbonize the state’s electric grid by mid-century. His  plan also called for restoring authority to the State Corporation Commission to adjust rates, such as reducing rate adjustment clauses, or the fees tacked on to bills so Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company can recover costs for generation sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental and ratepayer advocates criticized his  plan, saying it&#8217;s unrealistic because it incorporated unproven technologies and inaccurately attributed electric bill increases to renewable energy sources that are needed to combat climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislatively, Youngkin’s negotiations were instrumental in providing ratepayer protections, and restoring authority to the SCC to set rates as it sees fit, in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/25/general-assembly-deal-sets-dominion-profits-for-two-years-while-overhauling-regulatory-system/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Dominion initially introduced to increase its profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But critics also point to his desire to leave the California clean car standards, which aims to transition drivers to electric vehicles, and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a market that requires electricity producers to purchase allowances for each short ton of carbon they emit. The proceeds from those allowances had led to almost $800 million in revenue being returned to the state for flood resiliency and energy efficiency programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m a conservationist,” said Youngkin, who told the Associated Press in 2022 he thinks climate change is a threat. “We have done more investing in our last two-and-a-half years in promoting the long-term interests of the Chesapeake Bay and rivers and streams and air quality in the commonwealth of Virginia than any other administration in the history of the state, in my view.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walton Shepherd, Virginia policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said after the speech that Youngkin&#8217;s “refusal to bring even a single practical idea for tackling Virginia&#8217;s catastrophic climate change, and instead doing his best to ensure Virginia does nothing at all about it, is the epitome of narrow minded hyperpartisanship.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee Francis, deputy director with the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, responded to Youngkin’s speech by saying “It’s bold to call people who are working to solve our largest environmental threat — climate change — ‘small minded.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘Small minded’ is pretending this isn’t a problem,” Francis added. “I’m glad Youngkin thinks he’s a conservationist. Maybe he’ll start to act like one one of these days.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County has denied an appeal to overturn a land use decision for Dominion&#8217;s proposed natural gas plant, but community members </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">say they aren’t giving up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends of Chesterfield, the group fighting the project, was appealing the county administrator’s determination that a natural gas plant at Dominion’s old coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station on Coxendale Road would comply with local zoning requirements because of a 2010 conditional use permit that allows an electric power plant to go there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion initially proposed the 1,000 megawatt natural gas peaker plant, called the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, for the James River Industrial Park on Battery Brooke Parkway, but began looking into using the Chesterfield Power Station as part of its due diligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That diligence includes evaluating existing transmission infrastructure at the Coxendale Road site and two natural gas combustion turbines that remain after the utility </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/weather/dominion-to-deactivate-last-2-coal-units-in-chesterfield/article_55180370-fbc0-11ed-af93-4b12c6d63f68.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the coal units there. The retired coal units also would need to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">decommissioned and demolished, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends of Chesterfield had argued that the conditional use permit relied on circumstances for the former coal plant that are different from what the new plant may consist of. They also argued the new plant could potentially need 170-foot high smokestacks, which would be 20 feet above the county’s 150 foot height limit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In denying the appeal, the Chesterfield County Board of Zoning Appeals <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/July-8-BZA-appeal-denial.pdf">wrote</a> without a site plan for the former coal plant site being submitted, “the actual height of the proposed smokestacks is speculative.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friends of Chesterfield see that statement as a victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By its own admission, the county&#8217;s position that the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center is consistent with applicable local ordinances is based on zero project specifics,” said Glen Besa, chairperson of the Friends of Chesterfield. ”As we consider future legal moves, Friends of Chesterfield will continue to push for a public hearing and a formal decision from the Board of Supervisors on the suitability of the project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The local approvals are needed as part of the air permit approval process with the Department of Environmental Quality, which is currently under <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39340">review</a>, and that process has provided Friends of Chesterfield with an ally.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Environmental Law Center sent DEQ <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SELC-June-14-letter-to-DEQ.pdf">letter</a> stating the zoning approval for the former coal site shouldn’t apply to the air permit application Dominion has submitted because the utility’s request is for a different site, though the two are adjacent to each other. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, SELC Staff Attorney Rachel James said applying the local zoning compliance and site suitability determinations for an air permit application at the former coal plant site that hasn’t been submitted yet would be “premature,” since no specifics of what may constitute the plant, such as the height of the smoke stacks that determine how emissions impact the immediate surrounding community, are known.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can’t consider that if you don’t know what it is,” James said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a question about that concern, DEQ spokeswoman Irina Calos said, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoning compliance and a site suitability determination are required components of a complete air permit application.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If necessary, there may be a need to remodel the air permit for a different site,” Calos also said.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is proposing the natural gas plant alongside a suite of renewable sources as part of its latest integrated resource plan, a non-binding long term plan to meet future energy demands, which are expected to grow by 5% each year for the next 15 years because of data center development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plant would fire during peak demand for electricity, giving it the “peaker plant” name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the state follows the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 landmark law seeking to decarbonize the grid by mid-century, a provision allows Dominion to ask its regulators, the State Corporation Commission, to keep a fossil fuel generation source online out of concern to reliably provide power to the grid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have an exact timeframe, but we will make a decision soon,” Slayton said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time is of the essence.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A company created during the 2017 sale of Omega Protein, the lone menhaden reduction fishery in the Chesapeake Bay, is seeking a dismissal of a lawsuit alleging that it lied about its corporate structure to evade the U.S. citizenship requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 9, Ocean Fleet Services and several other defendants named in the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/unsealed-federal-lawsuit-alleges-omega-protein-skirted-u-s-citizen-ownership-requirement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed a motion to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ocean-Fleet-Services-dismiss.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dismiss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Southern New York brought forward by the two plaintiffs, Benson Chiles and Chris Manthey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chiles and Manthey, two private investigators involved in environmental conservation, accused the company of violating the False Claims Act by not revealing its foreign ownership, as required under American Fisheries Act and Jones Act in order to fish in the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Ocean Fleet Services, after filing its motion, said in a statement, “From the moment we became aware of this case, we have been eager to show that the allegations are inaccurate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our legal filing underscores several key misstatements from the complaint and offers concrete evidence that they are false,” the statement continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit is among the several disputes involving Omega Protein, which catches menhaden — the tiny nutrient-rich fish that environmental and conservation groups say are being overfished in the Chesapeake Bay — and reduces them down to fishmeal and oil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The critics say the loss of menhaden in the Bay affects the food chain for striped bass, which are falling prey to overfishing, and osprey. Meanwhile, the Reedville-based company says it needs to fish in the Bay west of the Eastern Shore to avoid unsafe conditions in the Atlantic Ocean and continue to provide jobs to watermen, as it has for decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/24/latest-petition-to-reduce-omega-proteins-menhaden-catch-limit-is-rejected/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to determine the impacts of Omega’s activity on menhaden in the Bay was left unfunded this past legislative session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it relates to the lawsuit, the American Fisheries Act requires that at least 75% of an entity fishing in the U.S. be owned by a U.S. citizen, while the Jones Act requires vessels transporting cargo within U.S. points be owned and operated by a U.S. citizen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit alleged that when Canadian-based Cooke Inc. acquired Omega Protein in December 2017, the company created another company, Alpha Vessels, also known under the business name Ocean Harvesters, to run the ships that catch the menhaden and sell them to Omega. Ocean Harvesters was then sold to Ocean Fleet Services, with American Seth Dunlop having 80% ownership of it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunlop, though, is the nephew of Glenn Cooke, CEO of Cooke Inc. the plaintiffs argued, and was placed as a figurehead of Ocean Fleet Services to get around the U.S. citizenship requirement while still funneling profits back to the international company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocean Fleet Services, in its filing, counters that the fishing licenses the federal Maritime Administration (MARAD) issued aren’t money or property, which, if obtained fraudulently, would have violated the False Claims Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further, Ocean Fleet Services lawyers state that the plaintiffs provide no proof to the allegation that MARAD didn’t know about the familial relationship when approving the fishing licenses. In July and October 2017, Ocean Harvesters, the company sold to Ocean Fleet Services, submitted letters to MARAD stating Dunlop is “related by marriage to one of the three family members that control Cooke,” Ocean Fleet Services’ attorneys argue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a general principle, [False Claim Act] pleadings cannot be based upon information and belief,” wrote K&amp;L Gates attorney Robert S. Silverblatt on behalf of the defendants. “[Plaintiffs&#8217;] method of pleading runs headfirst into these guardrails. … Virtually every allegation that [plaintiffs] make about the nature of disclosures to the government is made on information and belief,’” Silverblatt wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An attempt to reach the attorney for the plaintiffs for comment was unsuccessful Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Atkinson, chairman of the Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Association, has previously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/27/sportfishing-group-presents-petition-to-move-omega-protein-out-of-chesapeake-bay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questioned </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether Omega Protein should be able to send profits to a Canadian firm and has called for the company to leave the Bay so research can be conducted to see the company’s impact on menhaden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been concerned about industrial menhaden fishing practices for years,” Atkinson said. “If this global fishing conglomerate is in violation of the laws, they need to be held accountable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs will have until July 30 to amend their initial complaint. A next court date hasn’t been set. </span></p>

The power-hungry data centers will require new electricity generation sources to be built to provide that power supply. The project’s developers are planning for the building of the generation sources to spur long-term jobs, held by employees who will operate and maintain them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t think you can do that anywhere else in Virginia,” said Payne. “There is a coordinated strategy where we’re thinking about all the projects, how there is synergy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative has been met with several questions, particularly whether the abandoned mine land to be built on is stable, as past mining operations could have created hidden underground wetlands. There’s also the question of how effectively &#8220;mine water,&#8221; pools of rainwater that collects in formerly mined sites before reaching the aquifer, from the site can be used to keep the processors cool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One group, Southwest Virginia Nuclear Watch, said they would prefer the power for the centers to come from renewable energy and not a nuclear source like a small modular reactor, a technology that continues to pique development interests. SMRS haven’t been deployed stateside, but could provide more readily available power than renewable while also not emitting the planet-warming greenhouse gasses released by burning fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not totally against data centers right now, but we do have lots of questions,” said Sharon Fisher, a member of SWVA Nuclear Watch and the grassroots environmental group The Clinch Coalition. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The project</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data center development has exploded in the rest of the state, particularly Northern Virginia, creating debates over whether the tax revenue the centers inject into local coffers are worth the clear-cutting of forests, draw on water resources, obstructed views and noise disruptions that come with them. Southwest Virginia hasn’t seen much data center development, according to a map from the Piedmont Environmental Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes the region appealing for data center development, proponents say, is that they could be sited on abandoned mine lands, the properties that were left unrestored after mining companies finished digging for coal, prior to requirements in the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act that imposed penalties on companies for doing so. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Data Center Ridge site has been identified in Wise County, at an unspecified location due to some incomplete mining operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pitch for the project includes the potential to host about 10-12 hyperscale data centers on a 400-acre site. Hyperscale data centers can compute at speeds faster than traditional data centers, to meet the needs of complex artificial intelligence programs. </span></p>
<p>To prevent overheating without drawing on natural resources, mine water from the previously mined property will be circulated to the facility. The mine water&#8217;s temperature is 55 degrees or below, about 10 to 15 degrees cooler than a river that may be relied on to cool data centers in other parts of the state.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lower tax rate of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">24 cents per $100 in assessed value — compared to $3.70 in </span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/prince-william-supervisors-back-big-data-center-tax-hike/article_545eed52-fcb1-11ee-89c4-6b12f7b12ebe.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William County —</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can pad local budgets, adding to the appeal.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Renewable energy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Discussions about converting the regional economy to focus on renewable energy have been occurring for a couple </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/09/20/can-southwest-virginia-remake-itself-as-a-laboratory-for-renewables/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it’s the one gigawatt of electricity that Data Center Ridge could demand that is furthering discussion to deploy solar, nuclear and potentially blue hydrogen from natural gas in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid taking up coveted prime farm and forestland, and other reclaimed abandoned mine lands that may be suitable for traditional economic revitalization projects, Data Center Ridge developers are looking at the already disturbed sites in more remote areas. The Nature Conservancy has taken that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/in-appalachia-a-massive-forest-is-conserved-but-mining-can-still-proceed-beneath-its-roots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approach</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a Cumberland Forest Project that mixes mining with conservation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar that is behind-the-meter, meaning it serves only the facility and not the grid like a front-of-the-meter project does, could supply the needed power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A small modular reactor, which could produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity compared to a traditional reactor, could be part of the mix, despite the technology’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/11/dominion-seeking-small-nuclear-reactor-proposals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nascent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nature. Republican U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, who represents the area, has requested </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/energy_delta_lab_financial_disclosure_and_federal_nexus.pdf?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR32hxGkip7VpcTJxxG8GYQLkzcfMkEOmQg241wndV2qOVat4SIvQa43lEo_aem_AaFzUKzY4odnm1pWFhhvXw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.4 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the federal government in order to explore how mine water could support an SMR. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there&#8217;s more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playing a part in the region’s economy as coal has dwindled and renewables have yet to fully take off: natural gas, which had a market value of </span><a href="https://www.energy.virginia.gov/geology/NaturalGas.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$217.1 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023. The Energy DELTA Lab could tap into existing natural gas infrastructure to create </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/31/states-are-vying-for-money-to-start-hydrogen-hubs-what-are-they/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hydrogen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an energy source derived from electrifying water. With natural gas as the power source and carbon capturing, the form of hydrogen made would be blue, which is different from the green hydrogen that environmental groups prefer by using emission free renewables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no way to do this without every form of energy,” said Will Clear, a former deputy director for Virginia Energy. “Every service that we have, technology wise, has an impact on the environment. …The key for us is to figure out the least environmental impact that we can possibly have and continue to live a modern life.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39288" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/15/data-centers-proliferating-statewide-could-soon-be-built-on-mined-lands-in-southwest-virginia/img_1954/" rel="attachment wp-att-39288"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39288" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1954-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  An anti-nuclear billboard near the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia Energy has hosted community meetings about their traditional AMLER projects and both Payne and Clear have presented to the state’s Virginia Council on Environmental Justice, Fisher says there’s a lack of community involvement happening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We hear about most of these things through press releases, and we get tidbits,” said Fisher, whose concerns about the project include what to do with radioactive waste. “For us to try to dig into all of this, trying to get transparency, trying to understand what&#8217;s really going on, that&#8217;s the battle we&#8217;ve had for the last year and a half.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Workforce training</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jobs created by Data Center Ridge could give students who graduate from evolving community school programs the jobs people in the area want, said Clear and Payne. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Empire Community College, one of the higher education institutions in the area, is working to get students who graduate from high school and may need to find employment to support their family to continue learning by attaining what they call a “stackable &#8221; certification to get a job, said Kristen Westover, the college’s president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students there can get a certification in a field that can be matched to meet the region&#8217;s potential industry needs, such as cybersecurity or HVAC work, and then add, or stack, additional classes on it to get a two-year degree, which could be used to attain a four year degree. The percentage of students who go on to pursue a four-year degree jumps from 19% out of high school to 24% after attending MECC, Westover said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whatever economy you&#8217;re in, with AI, with technology, the bar has been raised,” Westover said, noting the school isn’t advocating for the data center industry to come to the region like economic development proponents are, but is there to support the effort. “We need industry recognized credentials and post secondary education now.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end result of Data Center Ridge and the generation sources with it, Payne said, are the jobs that could pay more than double the average median income of about </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/05/29/wages-in-southwest-virginia-still-lag-behind-but-are-growing-faster-than-both-state-and-national-averages/#:~:text=Those%20jobs%20have%20also%20averaged,lightly%20populated%20Bland%20is%20$59%2C901." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$48,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enough to keep people who get those credentials and degrees in the area, who would otherwise need to leave to find that type of job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wise County has a 65,000 square-foot Mineral Gap Data Center on 22 acres powered by an 3.4 megawatt solar project that is behind the meter. The $500,000 AMLER grant used for the solar project has supported 58 jobs. </span></p>

They house traditional nuclear reactors that each produce about 945 megawatts of electricity for a combined total of over 1,800 megawatts. On Wednesday, Dominion Energy announced its vision to build a scaled-down version of the reactors, called a small modular reactor, in the next decade, to produce up to 300 megawatts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, Dominion Energy Virginia is excited to announce that we have issued a request for proposals from leading SMR nuclear technology companies to potentially develop Virginia’s first SMR here at North Anna,” said the utility&#8217;s chair, president and CEO Bob Blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue made the announcement of the utility’s search for SMR design plans at Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s signing of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/10/governor-amends-vetoes-and-signs-energy-environment-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 454</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, legislation Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, carried this past session that allows the utility to recover pre-construction costs for a small modular reactor, including the RFP process, from ratepayers.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/07/gov-youngkin-wants-a-small-modular-reactor-what-exactly-is-that/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMRs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are what their name suggests: smaller generation sources that use a nuclear reactor to heat up water, creating steam that turns a turbine to make electricity that is delivered to the grid. While smaller than traditional reactors and touted to have increased safety measures, SMRs rely on high-assay low-enriched uranium as fuel that turns into radioactive waste through the process, which doesn’t emit planet-warming greenhouse gasses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The push for SMRs in Virginia comes as a way to meet unprecedented load growth projected for Virginia’s electric grid — particularly in Dominion’s service territory of Northern Virginia, the Richmond region and the Hampton Roads area — over the next 15 years, as energy hungry data centers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proliferate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To also meet that demand, Dominion is pursuing offshore </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/08/dominion-to-purchase-second-offshore-wind-lease-area-off-coast-of-north-carolina/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and natural </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/05/dominion-chesterfield-county-weigh-site-suitability-for-natural-gas-plant-proposal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generation sources to provide dispatchable energy when their </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/14/dominions-renewable-projects-approved-by-regulators-despite-cost-concerns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">generation sources may not be producing power and until battery </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/21/dominion-gets-approval-for-battery-pilots-appalachian-power-seeks-bids-for-renewable-projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storage </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">technology is further developed.</span></p>

Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, at the North Anna Power Station (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marsden’s bill allows Dominion to recover the preconstruction cost of an SMR through a rate adjustment clause, a fee that is tacked on to bills for project costs, for the design of an SMR, readying a site for one and licensing fees. The bill caps any recoverable amount to $1.40 a month for a typical residential customer for Dominion. The utility has said it would submit its filing to recover those costs with its regulators, the State Corporation Commission, in the fall with a “substantially” lower request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of that pre-construction process is the issuance of the RFP, which is confidential, to seek designs to build an SMR at the North Anna site. </span></p>

Glenn Younkin speaks during a bill signing at Dominion&#8217;s North Anna Power Station. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, who has pushed for nuclear and natural gas use as part of his “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/04/youngkins-energy-plan-calls-for-reevaluation-of-clean-economy-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the Above</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” energy plan to meet grid demand instead relying on renewable sources, said at the signing he is confident the SMR will be built because of Dominion’s experience running nuclear power and the utility’s responsible assessment of the technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the process that Dominion and [Appalachian Power Company] are going through as they review small modular reactors is a very responsible one,” said Youngkin. “They will make a decision as to how to deploy that technology with the best engineering firms, the best construction firms and of course the best supply chain. … I think we have all of the advantages to make this a big success, but also a reliable and safe one as well.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blue noted that the RFP does not commit Dominion to building an SMR, but, “an important first step,” to evaluate the technology at the North Anna site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an RFP is chosen, then Dominion would seek a needed license from the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and then begin the process for any other new generation facility, which includes approval from the SCC. A third license that Dominion already holds for the North Anna site would not be eligible for any new SMR that may be built. </span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: This story was corrected with how much power each of the traditional reactors at the North Anna Power Station produce and the fuel small modular reactors use.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael wasn’t waiting under a bus shelter as he headed home from a doctor’s appointment. Rather, he was sitting underneath a narrow sign that provided a sliver of shade as the sun beamed down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s very little shade right here,” said Michael, who added additional cooling centers would help alleviate heat stress in the city. “They don’t have cooling stations everywhere…it’s hot everywhere.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific journal </span><a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GH000985" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GeoHealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently published a report detailing the number of heat-related health emergencies and the inequitable effects of urban heat exposure in Virginia’s capital city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers found Black people in Richmond have experienced disproportionate heat-related illnesses during the warmer months of the year, while communities they live in have historically received little investment to help them keep cool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While human-caused climate change is driving average global temperatures to rise, some communities and neighborhoods in Richmond, Virginia experience hotter temperatures than others,” the research paper stated, largely due to a pattern of government disinvestment in Black and low-income neighborhoods. “Hotter, less resourced neighborhoods experience more heat-related health emergencies like heat stroke and heat exhaustion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research relied on Emergency Medical Services data reported to the Virginia Department of Health that found there were 492 heat-related incidents between May and September from 2016 to 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those, Black or African-American patients counted for 306, or 62% of the incidents, despite comprising only 39.9% of the city’s population. Conversely, white patients made up 32.9% of the incidents while comprising 42% of the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research also mapped the city’s cooling centers, which include nine libraries, and three centers that are opened when temperatures rise above 95 degrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 53.9% of the heat-related illnesses occurred within a 1.4 km, or .8 mile, walk of the centers, the report found — a distance that takes about 15 minutes for a fast walker to cover. Opening the city’s 24 community centers as additional cooling stations would put another 17% percent of the heat-related illnesses within that 1.4 km walking radius.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spending just a few hours at a cooling center can help prevent heat-related illnesses, but a lot of Richmonders might not know these cooling centers exist or they might not have a safe way to get there,” said Peter Braun, one of the researchers and a built environment policy analyst with the Richmond and Henrico Health District. “In some neighborhoods, if you have to walk down a street without sidewalks or shade from street trees or if you have to wait at a bus stop without a shelter, you&#8217;re going to be exposed to extreme heat.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39221" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1600px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/heat-illness-map/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39221" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/heat-illness-map.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1600" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/heat-illness-map.jpg 1600w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/heat-illness-map-300x300.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/heat-illness-map-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/heat-illness-map-150x150.jpg 150w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/heat-illness-map-768x768.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/heat-illness-map-1536x1536.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map showing the number of heat emergencies and locations of cooling and community centers. (Courtesy of research by Peter Brun and Jer</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Hoffman, another of the paper’s researchers and director of climate justice and impact at Groundwork USA, said having access to cooling options, “is a matter of life and death.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The research also reviewed the locations of the Greater Richmond Transit Company’s 1,618  bus stops, of which 5% have shaded shelter. Just under 200 of the heat-related incidents happened within 100 meters of a bus stop. The bus company is offering zero-fare </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/08/virginia-bus-riders-reap-benefits-of-zero-fare-and-new-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their air conditioned buses, Hoffman noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The findings build off work by Hoffman in </span><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that studied the effect of past housing policies on urban heat islands. Southside Richmond, an area Hoffman said lacks historical investment in sidewalks that could help people get to cooling centers, only has one such location on Hull Street. Last year, Hoffman had published research that found cooling centers around the state were </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/19/as-temperatures-rise-in-va-researchers-report-sparsely-located-cooling-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sparsely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> located. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protections for people working outside have also gained attention this summer season. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recently released draft rules that require companies to schedule breaks for people who are working outdoors. The Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit, called the rules a “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">crucial </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">step forward.“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Workers in our nation should not be denied something as simple as a water break or a few minutes to regroup in the shade,” said Juanita Constible, a senior advocate in the environmental health program with NRDC. “That’s just basic human decency. It shouldn’t be controversial.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency awarded $1 million  each to the towns of Dublin and Dumfries through the Multipurpose, Assessment and Cleanup Grant program, funded through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This funding will help assess and clean up contamination, create jobs by returning idle properties to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">productive reuse, and continue our progress toward a healthy and safe environment for all Americans,” stated EPA Mid-Atlantic Regional Administrator Adam Ortiz. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multipurpose grants allow localities to apply for the funding for several efforts, including those Ortiz mentioned, for one or more brownfields within their jurisdiction. The grants are part of the EPA’s brownfields program, which is similar to efforts to clean up </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/old-landfill-in-loudoun-county-being-cleaned-up-by-federal-government/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Superfund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sites that are deemed heavily polluted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southwest Virginia located town of Dublin will use their allocation for assessments, community engagements, planning and cleanup activities for sites within the 271-acre Dublin Industrial Park that include legacy pollutants from its former user, the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/11/citizen-group-pushes-for-halt-to-open-burning-at-radford-army-ammunition-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radford Army Ammunition Plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which makes rocket propellants and munitions for the U.S. Military. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contaminants at the site include  materials containing asbestos, lead paint and piping and Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. Within the park, the funds will focus on a former wastewater treatment plant, mixed-use and warehouse areas, and spots in the park set aside for future use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most importantly, the revitalization project aims to convert this large tract of environmentally contaminated land into a community asset through assessment, remediation, and community-based reuse planning,” the </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-05/r03-24-m-004.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the funding reads. Although the park has evolved to support the surrounding community over several decades, the application continues,  “in its current state, it is a source of blight and potential contaminant exposure to residents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In  Northern Virginia-based Dumfries, funding will be similarly used for assessment, community engagement, plans to reuse and clean up the Colonial Port Corridor, which includes a 3.5 acre site at 3800 Graham Park Road and the former 147-acre Campbell Salvage Yard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than targeting specific environmental issues with the funding, the town will use the money to assess what toxins may be in the corridor, beset by the growth of the tobacco industry that depleted their “seafaring economy,” according to the town’s </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-05/r03-24-m-003.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While neighbors like Vienna, Fairfax and Manassas rank as some of the wealthiest localities in the U.S. today, Dumfries has not held an economic stronghold in the region since their Colonial Port was flourishing in the late 18th century,” the application reads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Camrett Logistics, a current tenant at the Dublin Industrial Park, committed $1.5 million to $2 million towards adding jobs through building improvements and 58 jobs for assessment and redevelopment in the park’s warehouse area, stated EPA spokesperson Traci Benjamin. In Dumfries, where a recreation center is planned at the Graham Park Road location, new construction jobs are expected to emerge during redevelopment along with 100 long-term jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, Virginia Energy and Virginia Economic Development Partnership have b</span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/our-programs/land-waste/land-remediation/brownfields" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rownfields</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> programs, including a Virginia Brownfields Restoration and Economic Redevelopment Assistance Fund, which received $2.5 million in the state </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/budget/5012/HB6001/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for both this year and next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past legislative session, lawmakers passed and Republican Gov.

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy announced Monday afternoon the acquisition of a second offshore wind project area that could put the utility closer to achieving renewable energy goals outlined in state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release, the utility stated it will purchase from Avangrid a 40,000-acre lease area that could produce 800 megawatts of electricity off the coast of North Carolina for a price of about $160 million, including $117 million in acquisition and $43 million in development reimbursement costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction hasn’t started yet on an offshore wind farm in the area, as Avangrid’s proposals for the space and an adjacent one were pending federal regulators’ approvals, which Dominion will still continue to seek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement on the deal, Dominion’s Chair, President and CEO Bob Blue called out the increased projections in energy needs the utility is facing and touted the company’s experience learned through building its first offshore wind project, the 2.6 gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With electric demand in our Virginia territory projected to double in the next 13 years, Dominion Energy is securing access to power generation resources that ensure we continue to provide the reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean energy that powers our customers every day,” Blue said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy must follow the Virginia Clean Economy Act, state law passed in 2020 that seeks to decarbonize the electric grid by mid century. As part of that law, Virginia’s largest utility must produce 5.2 gigawatts of offshore-wind generated electricity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction of the $9.8 billion CVOW project — which is expected to generate enough power to serve 666,000 homes and avoid creating emissions equal to the amount generated by one million cars on the roadway — began in May. Now rising about 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach, it is expected to be finished in 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Avangrid lease area Dominion is acquiring, located about 36 miles from the shore of Virginia Beach and 27 miles off the coast of North Carolina, is called Kitty Hawk North Wind but will be renamed CVOW-South. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s acquisition leaves Avangrid with what will be called Kitty Hawk South, about 80,000 acres that could be used to deliver up to 2.4 gigawatts of power to North Carolina, Virginia, other states or private companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avangrid CEO Pedro Azagra said in a statement the deal provides, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significant capital infusion for reinvestment”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executing this agreement allows us to move forward with our long-term plans for the development of Kitty Hawk South, further demonstrating our commitment to accelerating the clean energy transition in the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year after securing approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the City of Virginia Beach. Detailed in-service dates or cost estimates for the wind farm, which won’t be recovered from ratepayers until Dominion files with its regulators, the State Corporation Commission, were not immediately available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project needs Virginia Beach’s approval, after the city in </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/11/22/virginia-beach-council-sinks-plan-for-offshore-wind-cable-landing-in-sandbridge/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">November</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told Avangrid the company’s plans to bring transmission cables from their offshore wind project onshore in a wealthy Sandbridge area of the city didn’t sit well with the community, following public pushback. Dominion, in its release, stated that it is aware of the concerns, and “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is committed to working closely with the community, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the City of Virginia Beach as it considers this project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday&#8217;s deal announcement comes after the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management announced an upcoming auction for new lease areas in </span><a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-offshore-wind-lease-sale-central-atlantic" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that could create up to 6.3 gigawatts of electricity. One of the sites, a 176,500 acre area, is directly west of Dominion’s CVOW project, while the other, a 101,443 acre area, is off the shore of Delaware and Maryland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We plan to participate in the lease auction to give us another potential option for regulated offshore wind generation development to meet the needs of our customers,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Dominion Spokesperson Jeremy Slayton.</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3553-1024x683.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3553-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3553-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3553-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3553-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3553-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Attendees at a rally against Dominion's proposed natural gas plant. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aliya Farooq lives in Chesterfield County within a three-mile radius of a proposed site of a natural gas-fueled electricity generation plant, a potential source of air toxins she’s concerned about after 20 years of living with her late in-laws, who had lung issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She, her physician husband and their kids saw the toll of those family members who had to breathe oxygen through a machine with wires, she said in an interview. There wasn’t much they could do to help their loved ones, Farooq said, but she doesn’t want her neighbors dealing with the same problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t see what the air we’re breathing really contains, but we all have enough knowledge through science to know that if there is a gas plant or a coal plant in the vicinity of a few miles within our residents that there are certain particles that we’re breathing in that can cause a lot of very bad health issues,” Farooq said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comments from Farooq, who is chairwoman of Virginia Interfaith Power &amp; Light and a member of the Virginia Council on Environmental Justice, came before a June 26 Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors meeting in which other residents spoke against Dominion Energy’s request to site the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, the natural gas plant initially intended to be located on Battery Brooke Parkway, in the locality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The local pushback has bubbled up during the local site suitability process Dominion must go through before receiving an air permit from the Department of Environmental Quality and a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the State Corporation Commission. Members of the environmental and ratepayer advocacy community fear that public participation in the process may be circumvented, if there’s a possibility the new natural gas plant could be built at the site of a former coal plant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Dominion remains steadfast in maintaining that the project, expected to come online in 2028 and supply up to 1,000 megawatts of electricity, is “critical” to meet the forecasted 5% annual increase in grid demand, largely coming from data centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plant is being proposed as part of long-term plans, which contain goals for small modular reactors and other new generation sources, 90% of which are renewable through offshore wind, solar and long duration energy storage batteries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is beholden to the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a policy that aims to decarbonize the grid by mid-century, but the state’s largest utility is allowed to ask regulators to keep a fossil-fuel generation source online past 2045 if there a concern over having enough reliable electricity sources, which may be the case with renewables that aren’t paired with storage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where we have come to here at this point, what took 115 years for our company to accomplish and build, we have to do again in just 15 years, we have to double our generation capability, power generation capability by 2039,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emil Avram</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, vice president of business development at Dominion Energy, said in an interview. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We wouldn&#8217;t build this facility if we didn&#8217;t think it was needed.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Site suitability</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current issue of site suitability can be traced back to a </span><a href="https://legacy.uploads.southernenvironment.org/words_docs/Fourth_Circuit_opinion_Friends_of_Buckingham_19-1152.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals Fourth Circuit that overturned an air permit approval by the State Air Pollution Control Board for the since-canceled Atlantic Coast Pipeline compressor station in Union Hill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approving the permit in the community of Black people — who are </span><a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/sites/default/files/publications/asthma_in_black_community_fact_sheet.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more susceptible to asthma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which can be exacerbated by fossil fuel emissions, including particulate matter 2.5 — reflected a lack of environmental justice, or EJ, considerations, the court said, which  should’ve been done before the board issued the permit.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39166" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_3603/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39166" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3603-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3603-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3603-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3603-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3603-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3603-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3603-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Nicole Martin, president of the Chesterfield NAACP, speaks during a rally against Dominion&#8217;s proposed natural gas plant. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Air Pollution Control Board then denied a separate air permit for Mountain Valley Pipeline’s proposed compressor station in Pittsylvania County in 2021, because of the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/12/03/virginia-regulatory-board-denies-mountain-valley-pipeline-compressor-station-permit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disproportionate harm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the project would have posed to Black citizens of the community. In 2022, Virginia law changed, shifting the authority to approve air permits from the citizen-appointed State Air Pollution Control Board to the administratively-run DEQ.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then came the site suitability form, created by DEQ following the 2022 law change to assist localities in providing the agency a determination of if a site is suitable for development or not. For Dominion’s newest natural gas plant proposal, Chesterfield County officials have not completed the form, saying they aren’t </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tIYmzMkDGQEDoRuoAKpdt1Hk-KxN8bK9/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">required </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to do so. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39168" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_3636/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39168" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3636-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3636-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3636-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3636-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3636-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3636-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3636-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Glen Besa, left, speaks at a Chesterfield County meeting with Supervisor Kevin Carroll listening. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For other projects, the form has never been sent to DEQ incomplete before, an agency spokeswoman told the Mercury, because an alternative written indication on site suitability can be provided. The spokeswoman confirmed that the form is not required to be filled out so long as that alternative written indication is sent.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Battery Brooke Parkway or Coxendale Road</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously happening alongside the dispute over the site suitability is a challenge over the locality’s’ stance that a conditional use permit at Dominion’s former coal plant site on Coxendale Road could be used for the new proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The former coal plant site received a conditional use permit from the county in 2010, which localities may grant to project developers for a site that may be outside of what local zoning regulations allow but adds mitigation measures through certain terms, or conditions, that must be met. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39171" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_3658/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39171" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3658-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3658-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3658-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3658-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3658-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3658-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3658-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The entrance to the James River Industrial Center at Battery Brooke Parkway, where Dominion initially proposed to site their natural gas plant.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 5, Andrew Gillies, director of Chesterfield County’s planning department, wrote a zoning determination to Dominion stating that the conditional use permit for the former coal plant at Coxendale Road would apply to the new natural gas plant. Allowing the conditional use permit to be used for a new facility would prevent the need for the county to hold a public hearing about the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From solely a land use question, the answer in this case is [that] current zoning permits the project at this site and there is no further action needed from the county,”  County Administrator Joseph Casey told supervisors at the June 26 meeting. Casey said he also sent a letter to DEQ and SCC requesting further public hearings be held in Chesterfield County.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39170" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_3704/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39170" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1584" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-300x186.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-1024x633.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-768x475.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-1536x950.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3704-2048x1267.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station at Coxendale Road.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Evan Johns, an attorney with Appalachian Mountain Advocates, wrote in an </span><a href="https://630a2cc6-3549-4fde-a051-9ed4442f8072.usrfiles.com/ugd/630a2c_536a150ddb4d4890935b2ab9a74940eb.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the new proposal has specific criteria, such as 170-foot smoke stacks, that are different from the  150-foot height restrictions imposed by local ordinances. The previous conditional use permit does not account for the potential new stacks and shouldn’t be applicable, Johns argued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Interpreting a 2010 grant of conditional use to allow for a completely new and different facility to be built over a decade later would conflict with the nature and purpose of conditional uses,” Johns wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of that appeal, which is considered pending litigation that the Board of Zoning Appeals took no action on  at a meeting Wednesday, a Chesterfield County spokesman declined to say why the locality didn’t complete the site suitability form. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the June 26 Board of Supervisors meeting, residents of the community, found by the federal government’s EJ screening to be home to minorities and low-income households, raised concerns over the plant. Another audience member shouted “build the gas plant.” Board Chairman James Holland, after listening to the comments, reiterated statements from Casey saying that future DEQ and SCC public hearings should be held in the county.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “We will work with Dominion and DEQ to find a site that’s appropriate,” Holland added.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39169" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_3638/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39169" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3638-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3638-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3638-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3638-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3638-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3638-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_3638-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Members of the Chesterfield County community hold signs opposing Dominion&#8217;s natural gas plant. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board would be “shirking” their responsibility if they didn’t have a public hearing to inform a vote on determining whether a site is suitable or not, Southern Environmental Law Center Attorney Rachel James said in an interview. James sent the county a </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FUZdzX7k8GFvf03kG5kHGU0T02ivE5mp/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requesting a public hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts to reach the five board of supervisors members for further comment were unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion, who has to make a decision on which location they want before any air permit review from DEQ proceeds, said one reason they are exploring the former coal plant site — which already has two natural gas firing combustion turbines on it — is because of the existing transmission infrastructure in place there. The  project’s estimated cost remains unknown and likely won’t be disclosed until the utility submits its certificate of public convenience and necessity with the SCC, Dominion’s Avram said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We would like to make a decision sooner than later because the clock is ticking,” Avram said, adding that the utility has hosted community meetings. “We have listened to the concerns from various organizations from the county itself, and we&#8217;ve incorporated that into our planning process. We&#8217;re not circumventing any public process. We are very carefully listening and responding and reacting to public input.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Part 2 of a three-part series on efforts to develop on abandoned mine lands in Southwest Virginia. Read Part 1 <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/01/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-aiding-virginia-energys-abandoned-mine-cleanup/">here</a>. Part 3 will be published in the coming days.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NORTON &#8211; Many miners in Virginia’s coalfield region may have avoided going underground and remained topside of the earth to procure coal through surface mining, but they were exposed to health issues that underground miners also face, including black lung, injuries or crippling addiction to pain pills heavily marketed to them after getting hurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Providing solutions for people enduring years of addiction has become one aspect of an economic development project in Dickenson County, and part of state efforts fueled by federal funds to clean up and transform areas of Virginia left damaged from decades of coal mining operations. The Dickenson County project plans to train people graduating from a treatment center for new employment opportunities and may help set up the area’s future for success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You may not correct this generation, but by breaking the cycle, the next generation can pick up the ball and run,” said Brent Hughes, innovative reclamation supervisor at Virginia Energy, during an interview. “That’s what they’re trying to build here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with the unprecedented </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/01/bipartisan-infrastructure-law-aiding-virginia-energys-abandoned-mine-cleanup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to clean up environmental problems with abandoned mine lands, thousands of areas that weren’t returned to their natural state by coal companies prior to 1977 federal regulations, Virginia Energy is receiving money for new opportunities to diversify the economic profile of Southwest Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress has given the state agency over $10 million a year since 2017 for the Abandoned Mine Land Economic Revitalization, or AMELR, program that is leaning in on regional cooperation, local officials say.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39148" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1896px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/03/virginia-energy-leveraging-federal-funding-to-diversify-southwest-regions-economic-profile/amler-projects/" rel="attachment wp-att-39148"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39148" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AMLER-projects.jpg" alt="" width="1896" height="849" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AMLER-projects.jpg 1896w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AMLER-projects-300x134.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AMLER-projects-1024x459.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AMLER-projects-768x344.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AMLER-projects-1536x688.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1896px) 100vw, 1896px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A screenshot of Abandoned Mine Line Economic Revitalization projects in Virginia.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the dollars flowing through the region could also help create a big business that leaves after a few years, some residents fear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think people remain optimistically cautious,” said Brandi Hurley, a criminal defense attorney living in Russell County. ”People see these jobs popping up, they’ve seen enough go in and go out to know there’s a very good chance that this is not going to be a long-term opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">AMLER Projects</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some AMLER projects may be in remote areas, or in more prominent ones, such as Project Intersection up on a plateau at the intersection of U.S. 23 and U.S. 58 near the city of Norton in Wise County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took about 15 years of negotiating and a $12 million grant for the site to prepare to host EarthLink, a call center that will provide broadband services around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 280 people will be employed at the building featuring conference rooms, lockers, a break room and tall windows showcasing the mountainous viewshed of the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For economic development, [perpetuity] is not a reality; very few things are going to be here forever,” said Fred Ramey, Norton’s city manager. “But this [building] is an asset that will be here forever. it will continue to serve in perpetuity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further north in the region is the $3.8 million Red Onion revitalization project in Dickenson County, which has received about $870,000 in AMLER grant funding with additional funding coming from the Appalachian Regional Commission, Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission and Coalfield Economic Development Authority. The location is where the training facility for workers is expected to go, on an area that was mined in the 1970s and then re-mined in the early 2000s, after regulations — requiring the mining company to leave the disturbed area flat and able be built on — were activated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project will be near a separate site that will be home to the rehabilitation facility Hughes talked about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got a big chunk missing out of our workforce,” said Larry Barton, county administrator for Dickenson County, adding that just 4,000 of the 14,000 people living there are employed. “What’s missing is that male age, 18 to 35, and those numbers pretty well mirror that male 18 to 35 in addiction. If we can leverage the workforce that we can rehabilitate and train, then we’re hoping we can locate people to this industrial park.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Regional, community input  </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The local officials  tout their regional effort to draw in businesses, like coordinating the funding through the planning district that serves</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee, Wise and Scott Counties and the City of Norton, dubbed LENOWISCO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lonesome Pine Regional Industrial Facilities Authority, or LPRIFA, was created through legislation in 2019, which includes representatives from the counties of Dickenson, Lee, Scott, and Wise and the City of Norton. The LPRIFA has agreements with its jurisdictional members to share revenue from economic development projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All of our localities have their own economic development, but we have seen more economic recruitment success and economic growth as a region bar none compared to what we were as individuals,” said Duane Miller, executive director with the LENOWISCO planning district.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some community members would like to voice concerns to the state over </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s13157-023-01750-y?sharing_token=fK9yQOn-HtZiqSSfp-OIGve4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY4WdfOzvU6X6ct2rK6szGVLplfIGxsdSKN-RocroT-vkq7len8Q4MVQhqGEBwZKG9Thr4s0FRjiEiD3nOzwT3I9DuzKY75WikU0DXKfTbBxWM0OTSBCTloM56J85Az-Gy8%3D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wetlands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that were created within the abandoned mine lands. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walter H. Smith, Ph.D, c</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hair of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Natural Sciences at The University of Virginia’s College at Wise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a member of the local environmental advocacy group The Clinch Coalition, has researched the topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he vast majority of those wetlands no longer fall under regulatory jurisdiction, so they would likely not be accounted for during [National Environmental Policy Act] reviews and receive no special protection from development during AML reuse projects, despite their important ecological and flood control functions,” Smith said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hurley, who’s originally from Buchanan County and from a family of coal miners, said that in addition to her desire to see the region’s forthcoming jobs stick around, she’d like to have some of the economic funding go toward training residents on how to run a business, or supporting tradesmen that will give back directly to the community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know a guy that makes banjos out of hollowed birdhouses; that’s a really cool skill set,” said Hurley. “Why not give that guy 200k, [and] open up a banjo manufacturing thing, something that people in this area already know how to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to those concerns, Tarah Kesterson, a spokeswoman for the agency, noted that AMLER projects have engineering plans that are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">professionally designed and certified “to ensure the plans are followed properly and no erosion issues occur.” Anyone with feedback, concerns or ideas can contact the agency by phone, email and regular mail, too, she said.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Part 1 of a three-part series on efforts to develop on abandoned mine lands in Southwest Virginia. Parts 2 and 3 will be published in the coming days.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">POUND &#8211; Southwest Virginia’s bucolic scenery is easy to see: steep slopes blanketed with trees; rolling farmland with grazing cattle; closely-clustered single-story homes and places of worship nestled at the feet of continuous mountain ranges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can be easy to overlook and hard to find, tucked away in the hollers of the 13 counties of the state’s coalfield region, are landslide issues that harm waterways and threaten residents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Cities are important. A lot of people live there, but there are a lot of people in southwestern Virginia,” said Sharon Buccino, principal deputy director of the federal Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. “We&#8217;ve left too many other people behind,” something Buccino thinks her office is changing, especially when it comes to rural communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Record amounts of funding in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law enabled OSMRE to find and diversify opportunities stemming from abandoned mine lands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Called AMLs for short, abandoned mine lands are patches of earth dug up by previously existing mining operations that weren’t restored when the businesses left prior to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, which stopped that practice from continuing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Energy, the state’s agency tasked with finding and cleaning up  the AMLs, was supercharged in 2023 with about $23 million in funding over the next 15 years. Before that, the state had received about $3 million to $4 million annually for the efforts since 1981. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think by the end of that 15-year period we will have knocked out about 70% of our (AMLs) inventory,” said Tarah Kesterson, spokeswoman for the agency. “That’s huge for us.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">SMCRA </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulations governing how mining companies dig into the earth for their product and treat the land after they are done come from the Surface Mining Control And Reclamation Act, or SMCRA, often pronounced phonetically  </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">smack-ra</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMCRA requires  mining systems to return the land to what is called the Approximate Original Contour — so that it’s similar to the surface shape prior to mining — and supports the drainage patterns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another, financial-based requirement places a tax on active coal mining that flows into the AML program and is then distributed to all the states in the U.S. that produce coal.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39117" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1905px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/coalfiled-map.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39117" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/coalfiled-map.jpg" alt="" width="1905" height="1054" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/coalfiled-map.jpg 1905w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/coalfiled-map-300x166.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/coalfiled-map-1024x567.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/coalfiled-map-768x425.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/coalfiled-map-1536x850.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1905px) 100vw, 1905px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A screenshot of the inventory of abandoned mine land projects in Southwest Virginia. (Courtesy of Virginia Energy)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s always been somewhat of a tension between the western states and the eastern states about the distribution of that abandoned mine land money because the west more recently has had more coal production, so it gets taxed more money that gets generated for the program,” explained Brad Kreps, Clinch Valley Program director for The Nature Conservancy, an environmental nonprofit working with the state on remediating mine land. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But the east is where a majority of the pre-mining laws exist because that&#8217;s where all the mining was through most of the 20th Century.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to needs for modern equipment that improves the productivity rate of mining, the stricter environmental and worker safety protections being put in place are said to have </span><a href="https://vept.energy.vt.edu/coal.html%23:~:text=Virginia's%2520peak%2520production%2520year%2520was,declined%2520to%252031%2520million%2520tons..html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1990, Virginia produced over 46.5 million tons of coal. The transition to renewable energy sources contributed to a decline in the demand for coal to produce electricity. In 2023, just over 10 million tons of coal were produced in the commonwealth, through a combination of surface and underground mining.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">AML program</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state has an inventory of about 3,000 known abandoned mine lands within its borders. It takes careful searching, and receiving tips from community members who may stumble across a coal seam where coal is embedded in the earth, to find them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they’re located, the state ranks the work to reclaim them by prioritizing those that benefit the human health and safety of a community — like removing a remaining highwall, or rockwall, from surface mining operation — and then considers environmental issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One environmental concern that has been researched with abandoned mine lands is the pooling of water, which in one instance collected at a former mine, called Clintwood JOD, that operated from 1973 to 1976 in the Dickenson County. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39113" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0057-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39113" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0057-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0057-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0057-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0057-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0057-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0057-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_0057-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Stone, in the foreground, that will stabilize the bottom of the hill of the Camp Creek Landslide. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time water pooled and eventually pushed through a bench, a flattened area at the edge of a surface mine that creates a cliff. The water caused a landslide of trees and dirt into a stream feeding into the Pound River. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The extra dirt there creates an increased flooding opportunity for that stream, and eventually the Pound River.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some water will run off of the coal seam,” said Virginia Energy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Manager Jon Fleming</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “It’ll all just kind of saturate. Everything gets real loose, like jello, and just drops. Our program goes in to correct all that.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39108" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2363px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1617-scaled-e1719611377471.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39108 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1617-scaled-e1719611377471.jpg" alt="" width="2363" height="1386" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1617-scaled-e1719611377471.jpg 2363w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1617-scaled-e1719611377471-300x176.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1617-scaled-e1719611377471-1024x601.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1617-scaled-e1719611377471-768x450.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1617-scaled-e1719611377471-1536x901.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1617-scaled-e1719611377471-2048x1201.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2363px) 100vw, 2363px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Ducks swim in a stream at the bottom of the Camp Creek Landslide (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Virginia Energy began planning the work to collect the landslide dirt during the $4 million project, but needed approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The agency also had to complete a three-year review from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to put in precautions for moving the endangered Big Sandy crayfish out of the worksite area downstream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $1.6 million from BIL funding now supports about 15 jobs wherein workers will dig out one side of the road, relocate a water line to the other side of the road and build a bridge over the stream, which can only be in place in the month of July to avoid impacts to the crayfish. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An excavator will then move onto the other side to scoop up about 30,000 yards of dirt from the incline through the end of September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re going to dig, and then it will settle. It’ll dig and then settle,” said Virginia Energy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">AML Chief Engineer Holly White</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “As we start getting more of this material out and finding more of the natural ground they will start to place that [buttress] material in there to keep new material from sliding [down].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The incline will be stabilized by larger sandbags at the base of the hill during the project. The collected dirt will be dumped into trucks that will be relocated to another surface mine reclamation site down the road or onto a private property nearby, before the bridge is replaced next July. During that limited window, the excavator will be driven back over the stream and the roadway then returned.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39109" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1618-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39109" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1618-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1618-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1618-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1618-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1618-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1618-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1618-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Sand bags that will stabilize work to dig up the Camp Creek Landslide.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’ll have spotters the whole time,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">White said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “It’s going to have to be very well coordinated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other projects that recently received BIL funding include water quality improvement initiatives in Amonate in Tazewell County and Hurley in Buchanan County.

(Photo courtesy of Kenny Fletcher/Chesapeake Bay Foundation)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time in 15 years, Virginia will reopen its winter crab dredging season, despite opposing recommendations from state staff and environmental groups wanting to protect the species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Marine Resources Commission voted 5-4 to repeal the regulation that has been in place since 2008 prohibiting the winter season. Commissioner Jamie Green cast the tie-breaking vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is a tie, the chair votes to repeal the regulation,” said Green, without making further comment about his vote.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commissioners Spencer Headley, Lynn Kellum, AJ Erskine and James Minor voted in favor of repealing the prohibition. Commissioners Will Bransom, Heather Lusk, Patrick Hand and Jeanette Edwards voted against the repeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Opening this fishery in the winter would be for the benefit of a very few and come at a high risk, in my opinion, to all crabbers,” said Bransom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland Department of Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz said in a statement the decision was a “bad day if you care about blue crabs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Commission’s unilateral decision will impact the species at a time when Marylanders are regularly sitting down to pick crabs with their friends and families,” Kurtz said. “A decision of this magnitude should have only been made with the support of scientists, in close consultation with Maryland officials, and in response to a significant increase in the blue crab population.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMRC’s Crab Management Advisory </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/03/virginia-crab-management-committee-requests-opening-winter-season-for-dredging/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month recommended reopening the season, after reviewing results of the winter crab dredging survey, which catches crabs in between seasons to assess how many of the crustaceans may be in the Chesapeake Bay.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia crab management committee requests opening winter season for dredging&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/03/virginia-crab-management-committee-requests-opening-winter-season-for-dredging/embed/#?secret=5QE8dIhAK8#?secret=oLUoHpP88X" data-secret="oLUoHpP88X" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest survey found that there were about 317 million crabs — about 2% less than the previous year — with decreases in adult females and males and increases in juveniles. Females, which are needed to continue spawning crabs in the rest of the Bay, are primarily present in the lower portions that are within Virginia’s border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey results were presented with 2023 harvest data that reported about 18.5 million pounds were caught, a 13% increase from the year before, with a dockside value of about $41 million, about a 31% increase from the prior year. The crabs’ higher value in the winter season,open during the same months in other states, was one reason to continue the market that members of CMAC pointed to last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A winter dredging crabbing season uses a method similar to the survey that scrapes chains across the bottom of the Bay to pick up the crustaceans, but allows the fishers to keep them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2000, a Winter Crab Dredge Fishery Task Force found that the winter crabbing dredge season had caught 32% of the females in the Bay at the start of the season, with upwards of 96% of the catches being female, explained VMRC </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chief of Fisheries Management Pat Geer, on Tuesday.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The winter crabbing dredge season had been closed since 2008 following record lows, which prompted Virginia, Maryland and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission, the regional groups overseeing catches in the Bay, to reduce their harvest limits by 34%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing the winter dredge season accounted for 17% of Virginia&#8217;s reduction, Geer said. Following the closure the number of females rocketed, from less than 100 million in 2008  to 250 million in 2010 before plummeting in 2011 because of colder seasons. The numbers have returned to more normal fluctuations, on a downward trend, since then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, VMRC staff, including Geer, recommended keeping the winter dredge season closed because of an ongoing stock assessment to better understand what is happening with the species. The stock assessment, which is expected to be completed in 2026, could be skewed by reopening the winter season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something’s happened in the last 10 years that we have to find out what is going on,” said Geer. “Is it blue cat[fish] predation, is it weather?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Moore, Virginia executive director with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, spoke on behalf of the Friends of the Rappahannock River and the James River Association, cautioning against undoing regional cooperation to increase crab numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of that 2008 work was the first time Maryland and Virginia and Potomac River Fisheries Commission had ever worked together to really manage this,” said Moore. “We need to maintain that precautionary Bay-wide approach.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David O’Brien, a fisheries biologist with the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, spoke against the proposal during the public comment period, citing the work his agency is doing to place dredged material over wintering crabs to conserve the species. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the meeting, VMRC received about 180 comments against reopening the season, with none in support, Geer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But commissioners in favor of repealing the prohibition spoke in support of opening the season to see what the impact will be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It concerns me that we continue to rubber stamp just a ‘we’re going to close the winter dredge fishery,’” said Erskine. “That’s what it seems to have been for a number of years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nathan Reynolds, a member of CMAC who spoke at Tuesday’s meeting, said “if we don’t do it, we don’t know enough about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green noted during the meeting that of the 73 fishermen who made about 1,500 trips during the last winter crab dredging season, “probably half of them are no longer with us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the repeal, board members had some discussion on what to do next, since there are no actual regulations in place to manage the winter crab dredge fishery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMAC had previously suggested a 1.5 million pound cap. Headley, on Tuesday, suggested limiting the number of crabbing licenses to 20 or 25 and have the season run from Jan. 1 to Feb. 28. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But VMRC counsel with the Office of the Attorney General told the board to not vote on any explicit provisions of the regulations Tuesday, in order to let staff create specific language that will be published, released for public comment and then, as expected, brought back before the full VMRC board in September. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin announced the expansion of an online platform to give the public more information on the status of permits across several agencies, a process that started with the state’s environmental protection agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://permits.virginia.gov/Permit/Search" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Permit Transparency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> website went public Friday, giving an increased view of permit reviews for six state agencies: the Department of Environmental Quality; the Virginia Marine Resources Commission; the Department of Energy; the Department of Health; the Department of Transportation; and the Department of Conservation and Recreation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, in a release, said the website “reaffirms our ongoing commitment to enhancing government transparency and ensuring it serves all Virginians effectively.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website, called VPT for short, is a continuation of the Permitting Enhancement and Evaluation Platform, known as </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-launches-platform-to-make-environmental-permit-info-public/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEEP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, used by DEQ. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PEEP was created after DEQ Director Michael Rolband, a former privately-employed stormwater professional, wanted a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/04/14/youngkin-administration-says-it-aims-to-speed-up-environmental-permitting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so the public could keep tabs on permit requests. Prior to 2022, when Rolband joined DEQ, it took the agency an average of 339 days to process a permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once we get an alert that an application has come in [via DEQ’s website], or somebody submits it the old fashioned way … the entire process from receipt of application, to issuance of a final permit, should not be more than 255 days,” said Eric Seavey, water withdrawal permitting manager with DEQ. Seavey noted the timeframe on Monday during a PEEP presentation, at a meeting with the state’s </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewMeeting.cfm?MeetingID=39880" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workgroup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to oversee groundwater management in the eastern portion of the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On VPT’s site, members of the public can search for permit applications by the agency reviewing them, their assigned numbers, the locality they’re proposed in and more. Clicking on a permit reveals a timeline of when the application was submitted, how long a step in the review process — like a site visit — may take, and when the whole thing is expected to be completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The types of permits currently on the website include requests for habitat management with the VMRC, Comcast’s undergrounding of utility lines with VDOT and construction of onsite sewage with VDH.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“VPT is a game changer for Virginia businesses and citizens as well as state agencies,” said Reeve Bull, director of the Office of Regulatory Management, in the statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VPT website falls under the purview of the Office of Regulatory Management, created by Youngkin, who also proposed reducing regulatory requirements by 25%. In instances of certifications for professional </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/13/certification-rules-for-virginia-geologists-who-help-reduce-environmental-hazards-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">geologists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/29/state-rolling-back-regulations-for-wetland-delineators-under-youngkin-directive/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wetland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delineators and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/29/proposal-to-reduce-cosmetology-licensure-hours-sparks-backlash/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cosmetologists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, members of those fields have raised concerns over losing the integrity of the programs by removing qualifications from state code.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ATLANTIC OCEAN — On a recent summer day, under blue skies, a 272-feet tall, 31-feet wide, 1,500-ton steel cylinder was being pushed into the ocean floor 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be repeated for months as Dominion Energy builds the country&#8217;s largest offshore wind project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s really cool,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Larson, director of public policy and economic development for Dominion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who was watching the action from a boat about 1,600 feet away. “In your career, you don’t get to work on a lot of 10-year projects and actually see it happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larson and others involved in the $9.8 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project were showcasing the project’s construction and economic benefits while trying to allay environmental concerns during a tour of the work with area reporters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Corporation Commission, Virginia’s utility regulators, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/05/regulators-approve-dominion-offshore-wind-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the project seen as critical in the transition to renewable energy in the summer of 2022 as part of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which requires the state’s two largest electricity utilities to decarbonize the grid by 2050. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The landmark law that passed in 2020, known as the VCEA, deemed Dominion’s 2.6 gigawatt project in the “public interest,” as the first step toward a requirement in the VCEA to ultimately produce 5.2 GW of electricity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After about a decade of planning and federal and state permit review, construction of two pilot turbines and a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/30/federal-judge-denies-delay-to-dominions-offshore-wind-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hiccup from a lawsuit by conservative and fossil fuel funded groups, construction of the project&#8217;s 176 turbines began in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Largest project Dominion’s ever done,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Nunn, director of engineering and onshore construction for the project, as he buzzed around the tour boat answering questions from reporters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project, scheduled to be completed in 2026, is expected to generate enough electricity to power 660,000 homes while avoiding the emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gasses equal to taking one million cars off the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The typical residential customer will pay about a $4 monthly fee over the 35-year lifespan of the turbines.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The construction</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The giant cylinders, called monopiles, are carried six at a time to the site on the Orion, a vessel from the Belgium-based DEME group. The Orion uses a “gripper,” or a metal piece that curls around and grabs the tops of the monopiles like a hand, to raise the structures vertically and then push them 100 feet into the seafloor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a big ol&#8217; crane,” Larson said, his anti-sea sickness patch visible behind his ears. “They’ll switch the vibratory hammer head out and put in a pile driving hammer head. They’re pretty good at it. That’s what they do for a living. We plan to do one a day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advantages to Virginia’s location is that the seafloor is sandy, instead of rocky or with boulders, allowing Orion to slowly push the monopile into the ground through vibrations before requiring some hammering for about 10 minutes in one instance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have more control over the pile to vibrate it in for the majority,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell Jabs, manager of environmental services for the project. “And then once you get to some of those harder layers where it&#8217;s deeper, you finish it with the impact pile driver.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39041" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/orion-full-2-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39041" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/orion-full-2-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1641" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/orion-full-2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/orion-full-2-300x192.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/orion-full-2-1024x656.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/orion-full-2-768x492.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/orion-full-2-1536x985.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/orion-full-2-2048x1313.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Orion installs a monopile for Dominion&#8217;s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 113,000-acre lease area of the wind farm, about the size of 85,000 football fields, is also about 50 miles short of the East Coast seafloor cliff that plummets about 3,000 feet deep. In deeper waters, floating technology for turbines is used, but</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here, where the ocean depth is about 85 feet, Nunn said that method </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was, “not cost effective.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the monopile is installed, yellow pieces that will transition the turbine from the monopile to the tower connecting up to the blades — the points of which will be 836 feet above the water — and other components are added. Those components are put together on land, and will be installed by Dominion’s construction vessel, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/16/dominions-offshore-wind-construction-vessel-named-after-greek-sea-monster-moves-to-the-water/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charybdis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’ll bring four towers, four nacelles [or covers for the components] and four blades out at a time,” Larson said. “Then it will go back and get more. It has a big crane built on it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the turbines, there will be three five-story tall, 190-feet by 190-feet unmanned substations that will be monitored remotely, Nunn said. They’ll have welds and hatches like any other sea-faring vessel, but monopiles into the sea-floor will hold them in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has a technology called gas-inflated switchgear, so you can put it in a much smaller footprint [than a traditional substation] but it can handle higher voltages,” Nunn said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The substations will draw in power from the the turbines before delivering the power back to shore through a connection of about 365-miles of 230 kilovolt export cable that will be buried 3 to 16 feet into the ground. Each export cable will have one slice, or connection point, while delivering the electrons to Virginia’s grid through the State Military Reservation area.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Maritime economy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the project was announced, Dominion has pointed to the </span><a href="https://coastalvawind.com/img/offshore-wind-economic-impact-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">economic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> benefits the region will see from the installation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has spent about $700 million on the project in the United States, with about $526 million of that in Virginia. The jobs associated with the project include some 1,552 around the country, with about 800 in the state and about 670 in the Hampton Roads area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orion has a crew of members ranging from crane operators to ship-hands that will spend several days at a time on the water. Construction of the other components will include a crew of up to 30 people, working 14 days for 12-hour shifts, and then getting 14 days off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes a very unique individual to be out on those vessels for that period of time,” Nunn said. “A lot of the guys that we’re targeting are Navy guys, Coast Guard guys that are used to being at sea at a period of time.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environmental consideration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite those economic benefits and the environmental benefits of wind power, the project has raised concerns among people who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">point to disruptions for marine life.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The region is in the migratory path of the North Atlantic Right Whale, an endangered species, and  also other mid-atlantic fish like the black sea bass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulators with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/28/federal-government-completes-environmental-review-of-dominions-offshore-wind-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlined mitigation measures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Dominion to follow after a series of reviews. To address any impact to the right whale, Dominion must limit pile driving to between the months of May and October, when the whales aren’t migrating from their home in the Northeast. Monopile installation will then begin during the same period in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also deploying a double bubble curtain created by an air filled hose that has perforations along it to send out compressed oxygen around the monopile as it’s put into the earth to absorb any noise from the pile driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw it on the pilot project. We installed one pile without a double bubble curtain and we installed a second pile with a double bubble curtain,” said Jabs, over the hum of the tour boat making its way back to land. “They saw over a 10 decibel reduction. Underwater noise is measured on a logarithmic [or exponential] scale, so 10 decibels doesn’t sound like a lot but it’s really significant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also buoys surrounding the construction vessel that sense if a whale or other fish species is in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had one of the buoys go down and we weren’t able to pile drive because we’re not going to proceed without that,” Jabs said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39044" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/whale-2-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-39044" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/whale-2-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="169" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/whale-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/whale-2-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/whale-2-768x433.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/whale-2-1536x865.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/whale-2-2048x1154.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Information on spotting whales posted inside a cabin of a tour boat. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protected Species Observers, or PSOs, are also on the vessels going to and from the site to spot anything swimming into the area and halt any activity. Pre-planning, to determine the GPS location of the monopiles, also discovered what habitats and abandoned ships were on the seafloor to avoid disturbing or running transmission cable through them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those abandoned ships and the two turbines built so far are wildlife habitat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Things grow on them, mussels, algae and then larger fish come in to eat on that, the bigger fish come in to eat off the bait fish,” said Jabs. “We’ve seen a real boom in black sea bass in the pilot program. It’s safe to say … they’ll start to build their own ecosystem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Nature Conservancy is conducting </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/18/scientists-to-study-how-offshore-wind-construction-off-virginia-beach-impacts-fish/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the behavior of black sea bass during construction, which will provide an opportunity to learn for the offshore wind industry,  Jabs said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the agencies paid a lot of attention to the data that we have, the data that we don’t have, where are the gaps to really frame up the mitigation and minimization measures,” she said. “It’s definitely uncharted territory, but I do think that [for] offshore wind as a whole, the environmental mitigations in place are very robust.” </span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Health is continuing its forever hunt to find the amount of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, present in the state by testing for them in water systems serving small and disadvantaged communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We suspect they haven’t done PFAS monitoring yet, and so they don’t know what they’re up against,” said Robert Edelman, director of technical services at the office of drinking water at VDH, in an interview. “And certainly we don’t either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PFAS are the thousands of different chemicals used in several household products ranging from winter jackets to cookware to firefighting foam because of the tight chemical bond they possess to repel water and heat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of that tight bond, the chemicals are nearly impossible to break down, meaning they end up in landfills, can leak into groundwater, and then get soaked up by clouds that send them back into the environment and food sources through rainfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new testing comes as part of the federal government passing final PFAS rules in </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enforce a 4 or 10 parts per trillion maximum contaminant levels, or MCL, for a limited number of types of PFAS. One part per trillion is the equivalent of </span><a href="https://www.ehs.harvard.edu/news/cambridge-drinking-water" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1 drop of water in 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new standards will reduce PFAS exposure for roughly 100 million people, prevent thousands of deaths, </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/04/10/federal-epa-to-formally-regulate-pfas-in-drinking-water-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EPA Administrator Michael Regan said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when announcing the new rules this spring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chemicals have been linked to serious health problems including cancers and reproductive and fetal development issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When issuing the rules, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency created a grace-period for public water systems to monitor levels of PFAS chemicals until 2027 before needing to treat any exceedances of the MCLs in drinking water starting in 2029.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Types of systems</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide and in Virginia, public water systems, or waterworks, are defined as those serving 25 people or more a day for 60 days or more a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, there are 1,072 community systems that serve towns, cities and counties and about 500 non-transient, non-community systems that serve schools or an office building where people return day-after-day but don’t live. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also 1,245 transient non-community systems, which serve restaurants, a campground or a highway rest-stop that sees groups of people coming and going rather than live in or repeatedly return to the same area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The community systems and non-transient, non-community systems are subject to the new rules. The transient, non-community systems do not need to follow the rules, with the thinking that the same people aren’t exposed to the potential contaminants from the same system over and over again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Private wells, which are unregulated in Virginia and primarily serve individuals&#8217; homes in rural, mountainous areas, are not subject to the rules either.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Previous testing</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to some sampling the Virginia </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/topics-of-interest/per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Environmental Quality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has done, the Virginia Department of Health conducted two phases of testing across Virginia’s publicly regulated water systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first of those happened in </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/14/2021/09/VA-PFAS-Sample-Study-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with 45 of 50 systems that VDH reached out to agreeing to participate. The effort targeted larger systems serving about 5.25 million of the state’s about 7 million population, Elemen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phase II, in 2022 and 2023, sampled 274 systems which were smaller community systems, and a handful of non-transient, non-community systems that were near areas that included known sources of PFAS, such as large airports that may use firefighting foam with the chemicals, and unlined landfills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of that sampling, PFAS was found to be present in the Roanoke, Newport News and Potomac River areas.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39020" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39020 size-large" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-1024x407.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="407" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-1024x407.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-300x119.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-768x305.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend-1536x611.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PFAS-6.13.24-with-legend.jpg 1901w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A screenshot of sites sampled for PFAS by the Virginia Department of Health (Courtesy of Virginia Department of Health)</p></figure>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New testing</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, in Phase III, VDH is sampling small and disadvantaged communities, which include the “vast majority” of systems in Virginia, Edelman said. These systems include those serving populations of less than 10,000 and are deemed burdened under the EPA’s Environmental Justice </span><a href="https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/#5.14/38.018/-79.421" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">screening</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effort is expected to collect about 400 samples in all areas of the state over the next two or three months, Edelman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you consider that we have over a thousand community water systems, 400 samples isn’t enough to get the job done,” said Edelman. “But it&#8217;s the next step in making progress identifying the PFAS levels across the state…it’s a doable step.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the about $27 million the state received from the federal government for 2022 and 2023, and $13.5 million this year can be tapped into to offset the costs of testing, Edelman said at a recent waterworks advisory committee </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=meeting%5C58%5C39892%5CAgenda_VDH_39892_v1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More testing</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The testing is all seen as a way to get a handle on understanding where PFAS are in Virginia before beginning to figure out where the substances are coming from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Pomeroy, attorney for the Virginia Municipal Drinking Water Association that represents waterworks that serve about 3 in every 4 Virginians, said in a statement that the “VMDWA is pleased to know that VDH intends to assist small disadvantaged communities with PFAS testing, which will be helpful for determining where PFAS reduction is needed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The testing of the smaller systems “absolutely needs to be done,” added Betsy Nichols, vice president of the Potomac Riverkeeper Network, a local environmental group, since those might be in rural areas that are more likely to use biosolids from wastewater treatment plants as fertilizer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The level of exposure in private wells also needs to be understood, Nichols added. She suggested the state could set up a grant program to help users of those systems conduct the testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It costs her group about $90 to $100 to conduct small tests, which require strict protocols for handling and storage because of the ease of outside particles contaminating the test subjects, Nichols said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe [the wells] are all fine, but you don’t really know until you test,” Nichols said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also of importance is knowing where PFAS is coming from, such as carpet manufacturers, metal finishers and pesticides that use them, in order to “shut off the tap” and begin using alternatives, Nichols said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we don’t start moving more quickly, we won’t have made all the changes that are needed to be implemented when that deadline hits,” Nichols said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past session Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/10/governor-amends-vetoes-and-signs-energy-environment-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a bill setting up a process for the Department of Environmental Quality to identify “significant” sources of PFAS. The bill passed despite some advocates initially wanting a more direct report from those using the chemicals to identify how they were introduced into the environment in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDH will also be embarking on a $500,000 study, due to the General Assembly by Dec. 1, to determine how much it may cost to have waterworks make upgrades to treat PFAS, which could cost </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/09/pfas-clean-up-could-cost-virginia-public-water-systems-millions-for-years-to-come/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">millions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gains in Virginia are an improvement, but come as the rest of the 64,000-mile region that extends into New York is falling short of its annual goal as part of the multi-state effort to improve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Forest buffers are foundational for meeting many of the partnership’s goals for water quality, habitat, climate resilience and people,” said Katherine Brownson, U.S. Forest Service liaison to the Chesapeake Bay Program and coordinator of the Chesapeake Bay Program Forestry Workgroup, in a </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/news/pressrelease/while-forest-buffer-restoration-advances-in-the-bay-watershed-forest-loss-offsets-gains" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riparian forest buffers are the trees, shrubs and bushes planted along waterways that catch nutrients running off from land before they enter and pollute waterways feeding into the Chesapeake Bay. The roots also hold onto dirt along stream banks, preventing erosion from clouding streams and rivers that fish swim in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, the U.S. The Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees the Chesapeake Bay Program that tracks cleanup progress of the Bay, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/05/states-not-on-track-to-meet-2025-chesapeake-bay-goals-says-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acknowledged </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that targets to clean up the Bay by a certain amount next year are not likely to be met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month, the Bay program reported that Virginia had planted 298 miles of buffers in 2023, up from 50 in 2022. The watershed as a whole added 640 miles of riparian barriers in 2023, up from 457 in 2022. The watershed’s goal is to add 900 miles a year, and conserve existing barriers until 70% of the riparian, or stream, areas are forested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Satellite imagery from the Bay Program’s</span> <a href="https://www.chesapeakeconservancy.org/conservation-innovation-center/high-resolution-data/lulc-data-project-2022/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land Use and Land Cover Data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, collected every four years, shows that in 2013 and 2014, about 69.3% of the watershed’s 4.6 million riparian area was forested. That number fell to 68.8% in 2017 and 2018, a loss of 21,743 acres representing a .47% decrease.%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, which has about 40% of the watershed’s riparian area, had forested over </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakeprogress.com/abundant-life/forest-buffers" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its riparian area as of 2018, but experienced the largest loss of all the watershed states between 2014 and 2018, about .85%, or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">15,829 acres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay Program also noted an increase in general </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakeprogress.com/abundant-life/tree-canopy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tree canopy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> numbers within the watershed, but a net loss trend. This year, members of Virginia’s House of Delegates and Senate passed bills that expanded statewide the authority to replace and conserve trees that may be destroyed during the homebuilding process, but Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/10/governor-amends-vetoes-and-signs-energy-environment-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> them, while signing one that encourages a review of tree conservation efforts and calls for the creation of an urban forestry plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an environmental nonprofit focused on cleaning up the bay, noted that this year’s forested buffers planted across the region were the most since 2016, but said, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">our region is </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">losing more forested buffers to development and other causes than it is gaining through planting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even though we’ve long known that protecting and restoring trees along waterways is one of the most efficient ways to prevent pollution to the Chesapeake Bay, these efforts are still falling short,” said Alison Prost, Bay Foundation vice president for environmental protection and restoration, in a statement.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Forestry has a </span><a href="https://dof.virginia.gov/water-quality-protection/water-quality-protection-landowner-assistance/plant-riparian-forest-buffers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help install tree buffers on people’s properties, which has included a partnership with the Bay Foundation and the James River Association to install over 1,000 acres of trees planted along waterways in the Upper and Middle James River Watershed over the past five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These forested buffers are planted at no cost to the landowner,” said Matt Kowalski, Watershed Restoration Scientist for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation in Virginia.</span></p>

(Courtesy of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Conservation and Recreation </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offers a cost-share program for farmers to install the buffers on their property, as well as several other pollution and sediment reduction agricultural best management practices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/06/29/record-funding-to-reduce-agricultural-pollution-expected-to-aid-bay-cleanup/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">amounts of funding devoted to DCR’s cost-share program in recent years, at its June 26 meeting, the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board is expected to allocate about </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$206 million to the cost-share program to implement the best management practices throughout the state, with about $106 million devoted to the Bay watershed region of the state </span></p>
<p>According to information from DCR, cost-share funding led to the installation of about 6,000 acres of forested buffers as of 2023. About 4,000 acres need to be planted this year, and each of the next three years, in order to meet a Bay cleanup goal of 21,000 acres of forested buffers planted by the end of 2027.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Farm Bill, a federal piece of legislation carried out primarily by the U.S. Department of Agriculture has funded a </span><a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/conservation-programs/conservation-reserve-enhancement/index" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that offsets costs for forest buffer installation, and recently made changes to dole out payments on a rolling basis rather than on an annual occurrence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Virginia Farm Bureau President Wayne Pryor wrote in the organization’s September magazine that tree buffers, among other practices, “are conservation methods that farmers may already want to implement, but don’t have the resources to do so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martha Moore, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">senior vice president of governmental relations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Virginia Farm Bureau, added that the development that is taking up land with forrested buffers &#8220;is probably impacted by solar.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why the tree conservation plan&#8221; the Department of Forestry is working on is important, Moore added.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury - July 26,2018)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Valley Pipeline, the 303-mile vessel that will deliver natural gas from the Appalachian region of West Virginia into Southwest Virginia, officially went into service Friday, after about a decade of steadfast opposition over concerns about environmental and community impacts in the areas in its path.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release, the company said the project is now available to deliver natural gas with a capacity of up to 2 billion cubic feet of gas per day. Roanoke Gas said in a separate </span><a href="https://www.roanokegas.com/roanoke-gas-company-milestone/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Friday it had begun receiving the fossil fuel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diana Charletta, president and chief executive officer of Equitrans Midstream Corp, the pipeline’s developer, called the day an “important and long-awaited one,” for the country that will allow “greater access to an abundant supply of domestic natural gas for use as an affordable, reliable, and cleaner energy resource.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project was first announced in 2014 and planned to deliver natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale regions into Pittsylvania County, with an anticipated completion date in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But numerous legal challenges led the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn state permits, finding some agencies failed to adequately ensure protections against sediment erosion and harm to endangered fish species, such as the candy darter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2023, however, Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin included a measure in a federal stop-gap spending plan, the Fiscal Responsibility Act, that required all state and federal agencies to approve permits necessary for the project to be completed. The measure also prevented any legal </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/11/4th-circuit-dismisses-remaining-two-mountain-valley-pipeline-cases/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until it was completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that greenlight, MVP resumed construction in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/24/after-case-dismissals-work-on-mountain-valley-pipeline-resumes-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company requested final approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Monday, stating that the project was “mechanically complete.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, FERC granted the OK, after consultation with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration revealed the agency “had no objections if Commission staff were to authorize in-service for the Mountain Valley Pipeline projec</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">t.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP had entered into a consent </span><a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/2023-10/PHMSA%20Consent%20Agreement%20and%20Order%20-%20Equitrans%20Midstream.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with PHMSA in October, because of conditions posing “an integrity risk to public safety, property or the environment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry L. Turpin, director of the FERC office that oversees the project stated that “Mountain Valley has adequately stabilized the areas disturbed by construction and that restoration and stabilization of the construction work are proceeding satisfactorily.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of the project, initially stated to be $3.5 billion in 2018, more than doubled to </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/04/30/mountain-valley-pipeline-final-cost-revised-up-to-7-85-billion/#:~:text=The%20project's%20lead%20developer%20said,by%20the%20end%20of%20May." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$7.85 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to a news release earlier this year.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scrutiny of the project, including the safety of coatings on the pipeline that laid out in the elements during years of delay and violations for preventing sediment erosion, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/02/mountain-valley-pipeline-opponents-ask-virginia-agency-to-issue-stop-work-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in recent weeks as requests for the project to come online were submitted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, when the pipeline’s activation was imminent, groups who have been advocating on behalf of indigenous people, other community members and the environment in West and Southwest Virginia raised their concerns and called for continued caution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know how else to express how angry, infuriated, grief stricken I am in this moment,” said Russell Chisholm, co-executive director of Protect our Water and Heritage Rights. The pipeline would have “repercussions …for everyone upstream in the fracking fields, and everyone downstream, where the gas is shipped and eventually burned, overheating our planet.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a test </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/08/mountain-valley-pipeline-segment-ruptures-during-test/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on May 1, Appalachian Voices continuously submitted requests for information on inspection reports, in addition to  the March 29 quarterly report that was most recently released, but received no response, said Jessica Sims, the group’s Virginia field coordinator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of response from PHMSA and FERC has left community members in the dark with little legal recourse to take action, Sims added, while condemning Manchin’s intervention at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The level of congressional interference with the project was unprecedented and certainly concerning as a reality that could happen again,” Sims said. “We remain deeply disappointed that one pet project was put on an unrelated debt bill and used to pressure members of congress on a matter they should not have been weighing in on in that way. That lack of separation of judicial and legislative powers is deeply concerning,” said Sims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PHMSA officials said in response to questions over its transparency, that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">information for the public can be found on PHMSA’s website in an </span><a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/foia/phmsa-electronic-reading-room" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electronic reading room</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A PHMSA official said the law requires the agency to “consult and redact” information that’s sensitive or confidential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This process can take time. Nonetheless, PHMSA and its community liaisons have provided numerous briefings to the public directly, congressional offices, and to interested reporters on the matter.“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP will be required to conduct different testing within a year of operation and the agency is awaiting results on what caused the May test failure, the official added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality, “will continue to monitor the progress of final grading, stabilization, and </span><a href="https://www.mountainvalleypipeline.info/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Appendix-H_Restoration-Plan_10-May-2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which includes vegetation establishment,” an agency spokesperson stated Friday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday, the Board of Professional </span>Soil Scientists, Wetland Professionals, and Geologists<span style="font-weight: 400;"> approved the regulation reductions for a voluntary professional geologists certification under the directive of Youngkin’s Executive Order 19, designed to cut down  “discretionary” regulatory requirements for job certifications by 25%. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Geologist certification</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term discretionary regulations refers to existing rules that go beyond what the law that created them dictates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest reductions came after the board  proposed changes in </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/l/ViewStage.cfm?stageid=10098" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">August</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of a Notice of Intended Regulatory Action, or NOIRA, that included a review by Youngkin’s office and administration, in addition to a public comment period that received no responses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes to the geologist certification regulations were made as reductions for professional </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/29/state-rolling-back-regulations-for-wetland-delineators-under-youngkin-directive/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wetland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delineators and several other certifications have been considered, with employees in those specialities voicing concern over a weakening of standards to perform duties well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The changes that have been made to the regulation for the most part eliminate redundancy,” said Drew Thomas, a geologist and the board’s chair, after the meeting. “If it&#8217;s in the [law] it doesn&#8217;t necessarily need to be repeated [in regulation]. That&#8217;s been the flavor of the changes to date.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geologists study the Earth’s materials and processes. In Virginia, the job requires a wide array of knowledge to address how landfills may be built that won’t leak fluids  into groundwater, and how railroad tracks should be constructed in more rocky terrain on a hillside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The last thing you want is a great big boulder rolling off …that squishes your car,” Thomas said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Youngkin’s office requested that specific science and geology education requirements be put back into the regulation, the board considered some final reductions at its meeting Tuesday that included removing a Geologist-in-Training certification requirement. Thomas pushed back against the change, saying that earning that specific distinction helps employees receive promotions in their field.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another agency recommendation was to not allow geologists to place a stamped seal on development plans, but Michael Lawless, another board member and geologist, stated that landfill programs require the stamp on plans that contain siting criteria and geologic characteristics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board executive director Kate R. Nosbisch, who at first suggested the reduction, agreed to keep the seal language in after acknowledging that if geologists aren’t able to seal the plans an outside engineer has to be found to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another change the board approved was to remove detailed language on how a professional who has their certification revoked can re-apply for certification. Thomas said it might be helpful to spell out the process explicitly in the regulations, but Stephen Kirschner, deputy director for licensing and regulation, explained it&#8217;s rare to have that language detailed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The process is the same for everyone,” said Kirschner, with people being able to appeal their revocation or re-apply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board also agreed to remove multiple mentions of educational transcripts requirements, so that it states only one time that a transcript is needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Makes sense to me,” Thomas said in the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board was preparing to reduce 4% of discretionary regulations but that will likely “increase somewhat,” as a result of the final changes adopted Tuesday, said Joseph Haughwout, regulatory affairs manager at the Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation (DPOR). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive order from Youngkin doesn’t detail what happens if the 25% target isn’t met. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about any consequences if regulation reductions fall short of that target, Youngkin press secretary Christian Martinez didn’t answer directly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”Before implementing any regulatory change, agencies must ensure that the benefits of the change outweigh the costs while also maintaining essential protections for public health, safety, and welfare,” Martinez wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Robertson, a spokesperson for the Department of Professional and Occupation Regulation, said board members are the subject matter experts in their fields and, “ensure that individuals practicing or seeking to practice these professions are sufficiently qualified…with as few barriers as possible for the protection of the public.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robertson also stressed that the regulatory revisions should be “discussed in full view of the public” to ensure that the process is “transparent and open to public feedback every step of the way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A failed 2023 </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1480" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Richard Stuart, R-Westmoreland, sought to scrap regulation requirements for several voluntary professional certifications after DPOR said they weren&#8217;t necessary to protect public health and safety, a requirement of Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title54.1/chapter1/section54.1-100/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in order to regulate a profession.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several members of the professions that Stuart sought to deregulate — including geologists, interior designers and auctioneers — pushed back against the bill, saying that removing the certifications would hamper those industries&#8217; ability to operate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, a bill from Del. Bill Wiley, R-Winchester, and Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, codified the definition of geologists in state law by stating the “practice of geology” includes working to “protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public and the environment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Association of Environmental and Engineering Geologists, of which Thomas is a member, said in a </span><a href="https://aeg.memberclicks.net/virginia-geologist-workgroup" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about this year’s bill passing, “We’re thankful that [the] governor acted favorably upon this legislation, and we’re incredibly grateful to our patrons…for their hard work on this issue.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Wetlands delineators</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in Tuesday’s meeting, professional wetland delineator Robin Bedenbaugh presented the scope of his work to the board. The role has a voluntary certification regulation that is also undergoing some reduction reviews proposed in April, similar to what the geologist certification just received. In one example, Bedenbaugh showed two sections of wetlands initially identified on a Richmond-area property during a dryer season that were later determined to be larger, after a second review, and had homes built on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a developer’s question about what would happen to those homes, Bedenbaugh replied: “Well, there’s been no groundwater out there for the past three winters, but if we get to a normal, wetter year, their yards are going to have saturated soils and they’ll start getting mold in their crawl spaces. He wasn’t really happy to hear that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That situation demonstrates why experienced professional wetland delineators are crucial, said Bedenbaugh. “ We really care. We want to facilitate responsible development.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin, to maintain a keen focus on how energy projects can disproportionately impact communities in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once an incoming board member begins in their new role, the air board will consist of a full slate of appointees selected by Youngkin, whose administration’s handling of environmental justice policy has been scrutinized by advocates and lawmakers.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/ Virginia Mercury).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope Cupit said at the air board meeting last Wednesday she felt a need to express “a profound concern that I hope will resonate with all of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Environmental justice is not merely a catch phrase,” Cupit continued. “It is a fundamental principle that will guide us in ensuring communities, especially those historically marginalized, have a voice in decisions that affect their health and well-being.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbreviated as EJ, environmental justice is defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as the “just treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of income, race, color, national origin, Tribal affiliation, or disability, in agency decision-making and other Federal activities that affect human health and the environment.” The </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title2.2/chapter2/article12/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Environmental Justice Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, passed in 2020, seeks “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to promote environmental justice and ensure that it is carried out throughout the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental justice became more of a focal point of Virginia regulations after a controversial permit for the Chickahominy Power Station in Charles City County was approved by the air board, leading to strong community opposition and the creation of a public engagement </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/08/03/after-several-years-of-tumult-air-board-members-reexamine-public-engagement-process/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">committee </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2019. The power station was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/chickahominy-power-cancels-plans-for-natural-gas-plant-in-charles-city/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">canceled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the wake of the outcry; the public engagement committee, which the Virginia Manufacturers Association previously said led to costly delays for project approvals, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/09/future-of-virginia-air-board-committee-in-question/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=00ce81e4-20f3-4607-b694-96380a23fc07"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discontinued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> activity in 2022 under the direction of air board chairman James Patrick Guy, a Youngkin appointee who still chairs the board. The air board is tasked with reviewing regulation requests for everything from carbon </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/regulators-approve-request-from-dominion-to-drop-rggi-fee-on-customer-bills/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">markets</span></a> and<span style="font-weight: 400;"> vehicle </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/youngkin-says-virginia-wont-follow-californias-clean-car-standards-anymore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emission </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">standards, to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/14/dominion-to-seek-air-permit-for-proposed-chesterfield-gas-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">permits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for power plants, in order to monitor and control emissions that pollute the environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In several parts of the state, other projects have faced setbacks and scrutiny for how they could disproportionately impact the environment and quality of life in communities of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In January 2020, the Richmond-based U.S. Court of Appeals 4th Circuit overturned an air permit for the now-canceled natural gas Atlantic Coast Pipeline’s pollution-emitting compressor station, which would have been sited in the predominantly Black community of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/01/07/federal-court-overturns-union-hill-compressor-station-permit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Union Hill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Buckingham County, citing a lack of environmental justice consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Mountain Valley Pipeline developers couldn’t obtain an air permit from the Department of Environmental Quality for a planned compressor station in Pittsylvania County’s Lambert, after the air board pointed out DEQ considered Lambert an environmental justice community which could be </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/12/03/virginia-regulatory-board-denies-mountain-valley-pipeline-compressor-station-permit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disproportionately impacted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the compressor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cupit, as well as board member Lornel Tompkins, whose term will also expire June 30, advocated for more state consideration of the people who lived nearest the proposed compressor. They referenced DEQ’s analysis that found 32% of those living within one mile of the compressor station would be Black — although Black people comprise just 20% of the state’s population. The same report said 31% of residents within five miles of the site were low-income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following that decision, a 2022 law </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/02/07/republican-bills-aim-to-limit-power-of-citizen-environmental-boards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">moved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> approval of air permits to the DEQ agency level, which provides greater administrative control over requests than the more public, citizen-compromised air board, unless they are deemed controversial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The presence of an environmental justice advocate on this board has been crucial in bringing these issues to the forefront,” Cupit said Wednesday. “My role is to amplify the voices of those who are often ignored.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board chair Guy said Cupit and Tompkins have “given stellar service,” while being “very attentive with a great deal of integrity.” He thanked the women for their service to the state and also said it’s “safe to assume” Cupit’s replacement would be seated by the next board meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A DEQ spokesperson said the next air board meeting hasn’t been scheduled yet, but they are typically held quarterly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic legislators and environmental groups have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/20/democratic-legislator-questions-youngkins-appointments-to-environmental-justice-council/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin’s commitment to environmental justice after he announced his appointments to the Virginia Council on Environmental Justice, which was created by the Environmental Justice Act. The governor’s appointments came after long-running vacancies on the council, which members said stymied their work, and after he vetoed a bill by Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, that would have required him to fill the vacancies by August. Youngkin’s board picks were affiliated with the waste, labor, infrastructure, fossil fuel and electric industries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re not terrible people; it’s just, where are they going to be as it relates to environmental justice?” Jones said about Youngkin’s appointees in a previous interview with the Mercury. “We have to get people who understand the challenges faced by communities that for such a long time [have] been negatively impacted by a lot of the decisions that have been made by the energy community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to Jones’ concerns, Youngkin spokesperson Christian Martinez previously said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the Governor’s appointments reflect a variety of communities and stakeholders across Virginia who are committed to furthering Governor Youngkin’s efforts to protect our natural resources and vulnerable communities throughout the Commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee Francis, deputy director for the League of Conservation Voters, said Youngkin’s administration </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“hasn&#8217;t shown that it takes environmental justice seriously at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not holding my breath … that [a Youngkin appointee] doesn’t represent an industry they’re supposed to regulate, because that has been the trend.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average Dominion Energy Virginia residential customer will soon see a charge of about $4.50 dropped from their bills. The fee was being collected to recover costs through the state’s participation in the regional carbon market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, approved a request from Dominion to stop tacking the fee on customer’s bills to recoup the costs the utility racked up through participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which Virginia is no longer a part of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At this time, the Company states it is no longer accruing RGGI-related compliance costs and is collecting revenues to recover the costs already incurred,” wrote the commission in its order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion made the request last month after finalizing its costs for RGGI compliance following Virginia’s withdrawal from the market at the end of 2023, prompted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s regulatory action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although some Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups still say the withdrawal needed to be completed legislatively, Youngkin pulled the plug through the regulatory State Air Pollution Control Board because of the “hidden tax” he said the program created for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RGGI is a market with 11 participating states that incentivizes the decrease of carbon-emitting electricity generation by requiring electricity producers to purchase allowances for each short-ton of carbon they emit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the Virginia Clean Economy </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/02/20/ten-things-to-know-about-the-clean-economy-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which seeks to decarbonize the state’s electric grid by 2050, and the Clean Car Act </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/02/vdot-announces-sites-for-electric-vehicle-charging-stations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles starting in 2035, RGGI participation was seen as part of major policies to reduce emissions that </span><a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6syr/pdf/IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say is causing climate change’s damaging weather shifts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the state’s utilities produce their own electricity, meaning Dominion had to purchase the allowances. The state also allows utilities to recover the costs of those allowances from their customers, which amounted to about $2.39 per month for a typical residential customer when Youngkin took office in 2022.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Youngkin had signaled his desire to leave RGGI prior to being elected, Dominion had </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/06/dominion-asks-to-halt-ratepayer-charge-for-carbon-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">paused </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">collecting the rider fee in 2022, when the state’s exit from RGGI seemed imminent.  But the regulatory process of leaving RGGI was extended, and Dominion continued purchasing allowances for its Virginia City Hybrid Center that runs on coal and biomass, among other sources.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/26/dominion-gets-approval-to-charge-customers-again-for-carbon-market-participation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the utility petitioned for recovery of the costs it accrued during the extended withdrawal, as well as costs anticipated to arise until withdrawal was complete, leading to the $4.34 fee for residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity. Those fees helped Dominion to recover about $283 million, about $73 million short of what staff projected the utility would need after reducing Dominion’s initial request of $373 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For comparison, Appalachian Power Company, Virginia’s second largest utility serving the Southwest Virginia area, had incurred costs of $341,000 in 2021, $275,000 in 2022, and approximately $180,000 as of July 2023, all for the utility’s Clinch River Plant. Teresa Hall, Appalachian Power spokeswoman, said the utility is no longer incurring costs for RGGI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the state having left the market in December, Dominion was on pace to collect $63 million more than it needed if the rider remained in effect from September 1 of last year until the end of August, as it initially requested to recover the allowance costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Resetting Rider RGGI will immediately reduce the typical residential customer’s bill … with greater reductions for higher energy consumers in the residential, as well as commercial and industrial classes,” said Paul McLeod, director of regulatory accounting for Dominion, in </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7zk801!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testimony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion will zero out the rider by July 15 after seeing what is actually recovered through May 31, according to the SCC. Any minimal over- or under-earnings will then be recovered through the utility’s base rates and reviewed by the SCC during Dominion’s next rate case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups are suing the state for what they say was an unlawful withdrawal from the carbon market that has generated an unprecedented amount of funding for flood mitigation and energy efficiency projects. The revenues for the allowance purchases are returned to the states, where in Virginia almost $830 million has been funneled toward those projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC noted in its order that it wasn’t opining on the litigation surrounding the state’s withdrawal from RGGI. The case is scheduled to have its next hearing June 24 with a new judge, after a long delay led to the previous judge in the case recusing themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers attempted to reinstate Virginia in RGGI through the budget process this year, but the language was removed as part of the legislature’s  compromise with Youngkin to pass a spending plan that was months overdue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to respond to our constituents … we will act,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said House Majority leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, on Democrats’ initial push to reintroduce the state into RGGI despite the governor’s clear disinterest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked if lawmakers would consider changing how Dominion can recover the costs of the allowances from customers, Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said, “let’s deal with the issue in front of us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beating the same drum as before by calling RGGI a “tax,” Youngkin Press Secretary Christian Martinez said that the governor has been committed to lowering the cost of living for Virginians by removing the recovery of the costs on bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Monday’s] action by the Virginia State Corporation Commission is an important step forward in reducing costs for Virginians,” said Martinez.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not allowing Dominion to recover a fee for the RGGI costs through their rider should be disallowed by the legislature, said Walton Shepherd, Virginia Policy Director for the Natural Resource Defense Council, considering the market lowered Virginia’s emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The air pollution that RGGI had improved will surely get worse again — making dirtier Virginia air one of Youngkin’s most ignoble legacies,” Shepherd said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Greene, an electric utility regulatory attorney with GreeneHurlocker, noted that if the court does find that the withdrawal from RGGI was unlawful, Dominion would be allowed to add the rider fees back to customers’ bills to recover its RGGI allowance costs again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can look at that and say it’s big money put to excellent use, or you can say it requires ratepayers to pay more than they otherwise should,” Greene stated, of the revenues returned to the state. “The beauty is in the eye of the beholder.”</span></p>
<p><em>This article was corrected with the amount Dominion had recovered through through the reinstatement of the RGGI rider.</em></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks with reporters about this year's hurricane season forecasts, May 24, 2024. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2003, Hurricane Isabel slammed the East Coast and thrashed Virginia and North Carolina most severely, </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/publications/assessments/isabel.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prompting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> widespread power outages, 4 to 6 foot storm surges, flooding, and billions in damage; the storm caused at least 50 direct and indirect deaths. Lasting memories of that disaster now loom large, as the federal government </span><a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forecasts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year’s hurricane season, June 1 to Nov. 30, will be a tumultuous one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can have 27 storms in a year,” said Shawn Talmadge, state coordinator at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. “Only one storm can cause devastation across the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the active hurricane season, state leaders are urging Virginians to prepare as environmental groups call for stronger policy addressing storms that are increasing in frequency and intensity.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">This hurricane season</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase in storms coincides with a climate pattern switch, from the dryer El Niño season to the stormier La Niña season.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LQBmnannFs"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/13/la-nina-is-coming-raising-the-chances-of-a-dangerous-atlantic-hurricane-season/">La Niña is coming, raising the chances of a dangerous Atlantic hurricane season</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, the federal government has </span><a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a range of 17 to 25 storms that have wind speeds of 39 miles per hour or higher. These storms will be named, which helps scientists keep track of the events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of those, eight to 13 are forecasted to become hurricanes, with winds of 74 miles per hour or more. Of those, four to seven are expected to be major hurricanes, reaching categories 3, 4 or 5, with wind speeds of 111 miles per hour or higher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With another active hurricane season approaching, NOAA’s commitment to keeping every American informed with life-saving information is unwavering,” said NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad, Ph.D.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific information on implications for Virginia was not included in the NOAA’s forecast, but an outlook for this summer </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shows that Virginia has an above normal chance of precipitation for the season. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38845" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/precip-outlook-scaled.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38845" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/precip-outlook-scaled.gif" alt="" width="2560" height="1978" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map of the summer 2024 precipitation outlook. (Courtesy of NOAA).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk is known to be one of the lowest lying areas in the country, with a susceptibility to storm surge from rising sea levels. NOAA points to climate change as a driver of sea level rise, which fuels storm surges and hurricane damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Human-caused climate change is warming our ocean globally and in the Atlantic basin, and melting ice on land, leading to sea level rise, which increases the risk of storm surge,” NOAA said in a statement. “Sea level rise represents a clear human influence on the damage potential from a given hurricane.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The storm prep</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said during a May 24 press conference that residents should create plans to weather the storms, informed by federal </span><a href="https://www.ready.gov" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Number one, get prepared. That means have a plan. At the core, have the things you need: a flashlight and emergency medication, three days of food, a radio. Get a plan. Second of all, sign up for emergency alerts so you can be notified of what&#8217;s going on,” Youngkin said. “And third, know your evacuation route.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The press conference came after Youngkin met with the Virginia Department of Emergency Management and ran simulations of what a major storm’s damage could do to Virginia. In the town of Galax, in Southwest Virginia near the North Carolina border, officials ran a mock 48-hour emergency that dumped 20 inches of rain causing “massive flooding,” Younkgin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exercise was conducted by running disaster scenarios with 60 organizations and 100 people to help recovery efforts, including using swiftwater crews. In real emergencies, Virginia will rely on its Emergency Management Assistance Compact, or EMAC, that taps into the National Guard and other emergency response capabilities from other states, Youngkin said. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38846" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240524_125859-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-38846" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240524_125859-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240524_125859-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240524_125859-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240524_125859-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240524_125859-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240524_125859-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240524_125859-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Shawn Talmadge, state coordinator at the Virginia Department of Emergency Management, front, walks in a storm response control room following a briefing with Gov. Glenn Youngkin (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia will also cooperate with neighboring states to address evacuation challenges in the Hampton Roads and Eastern Shore area’s network of tunnels and bridges, which can be constrained during a disaster, the governor told reporters. The state will also coordinate with Virginia’s electric utilities to maintain power during storms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We launched this program a decade ago after finding that a significant number of storm-related power outages were occurring in a relatively small number of areas,&#8221; said Ed Baine, president of Dominion Energy Virginia, in a news release touting the burying of 2,000 miles of overhead lines as part of the utility’s Strategic Underground Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preparing for floods spurred by storms is also “really important,” said Emily Steinhilber, director of climate resilient coasts and watersheds in Virginia for the Environmental Defense Fund. With </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56af7134be7b96f50a2c83e4/t/5ecd3b7995a4d74aea7ec28e/1590508418832/VDOT+Chapter33.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple </span></a><a href="https://midatlantic-idf.rcc-acis.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> finding an approximate 20% duration increase in rainfall, Steinhilber added, “Hurricane season gives us some names and a time of year to focus on this, but oftentimes we see heavy flooding from now [until] the fall. We can&#8217;t let down our guard.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Policy proposals</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin acknowledged the need to balance handling back-to-back storms and post disaster assistance, which advocates say needs to be made more accessible to those who need it and stem from a dedicated source.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one of the scenarios depicting bigger storm impacts, Youngkin said “there may in fact not be surge capacity of equipment and capabilities” to help with cleanup, “because they&#8217;re already deployed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the governor has previously acknowledged that climate change — which scientists say is likely leading to more intense tropical storms — is a threat, Youngkin has also pushed for continued use of </span><a href="https://x.com/TeamYoungkin/status/1797734019565793784" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural gas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to generate energy, which can cause emissions that the same scientists say is leading to climate change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The repeated storms impact Virginia in different ways; one major consequence is flooding. The Southwest Virginia region was </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/05/16/10-months-after-a-flood-left-70-homes-damaged-or-destroyed-whitewood-residents-are-still-rebuilding/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pummeled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with intense periods of rainfall in Hurley and Whitewood in 2022 and 2021, respectively, that led to the death of one person; flooding spawned black mold in homes, leading to health issues and other complications some residents are still dealing with, said Emma Kelly, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">new economy field coordinator</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the environmental nonprofit Appalachian Voices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recovery is still ongoing. It&#8217;s been slow,” said Kelly, adding that flood-destroyed driveways alongside bridges in the hollers of the mountainous terrain haven’t been repaired. “Not only were [people] having to park across the street, carry groceries, carry whatever, down a valley, up a valley. A lot of these [people] are elderly residents — folks who aren&#8217;t necessarily the most mobile.</span><b>”</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following those storms, the state diverted funds from the carbon market known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to provide about $11 million to repair flood damage in Hurley and $18 million for Whitewood flood restoration. Youngkin issued an executive order in 2022 to pull the state out of RGGI. Lawmakers tried to force the state back into the program during budget negotiations this year, but that measure was ultimately </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/13/virginia-lawmakers-pass-bipartisan-budget-that-leaves-tax-policy-unchanged/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">excluded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the budget lawmakers and Youngkin agreed to enact last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other ways the state helps after devastating floods, but they come with challenges for individuals and communities who need aid. According to Amanda Love, spokeswoman for the Department of Housing and Community Development, the state  doled out about $8 million for 117 approved applications for the Hurley flood and about $1 million for 25 approved applications for the Whitewood one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But “legally and then financially, it&#8217;s just a bunch of bureaucratic knots,” Kelly said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owners whose private properties are handed down through families without proper documentation or a deed might find it hard to get help, Kelly said. Another challenge is how the state coordinates with various agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, to assist residents after extreme weather, said Kelly. Reducing requirements for the aid are among the policy proposals her group and several others are recommending as part of a report expected to be fully </span><a href="https://reimagineappalachia.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Appalachian-Flood-Resiliency-Platform-Summary-w-Logos-May-2024.pdf?emci=c6cb82bb-9c21-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&amp;emdi=c81ee5dd-b021-ef11-86d2-6045bdd9e096&amp;ceid=30748567" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Flood insurance is essential,” added Steinhilber, with the Environmental Defense Fund, because it can provide residents coverage in the absence of federal or state disaster relief. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several groups this year backed a bill to require people selling property in flood prone areas to disclose the risks to potential homebuyers, so they can understand what’s at stake and decide if they should have flood insurance. It was defeated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to diverting the RGGI funds, Virginia began its own </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/#:~:text=Over%20the%20past%20two%20years,destroyed%20and%20one%20woman%20dead."><span style="font-weight: 400;">research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year into how a state program could provide disaster relief if residents don’t get federal assistance. Asked about that research, a VDEM spokesperson and Talmadge pointed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s revamped disaster assistance </span><a href="https://www.disasterassistance.gov" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which now rolls aid applications into a single form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They&#8217;ve made significant revisions to the individual assistance program to include under insurance situations,” Talmadge said. “We&#8217;re just really excited about the number of reforms that the federal government has implemented over at FEMA.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden’s administration also announced in October about </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/grants/mitigation/building-resilient-infrastructure-communities/after-apply/selections?page=33" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$86 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant funds will be awarded  to Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the RGGI funds, putting more state resources in place to implement flood resilience master planning document updates that are due by the end of the year is seen as a critical next step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That will be a challenge,” said Steinhilber.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting Friday, some anglers in Virginia will be able to cast their fishing lines into salt waters at the cost everyone can afford: free.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From June 7-9, the Virginia Marine Resources Commission will lift the saltwater recreational fishing license requirement, which typically costs Virginia residents $17.50 to obtain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effort is intended to encourage the public’s participation in fishing, while still adhering to other regulations and conservation measures, and allow people to enjoy the state’s marine resources, which can be </span><a href="https://webapps.mrc.virginia.gov/public/reports/swrecfishingrules.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a smattering of species including pompano, red drum and the iconic striped bass, or rockfish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This initiative provides a wonderful opportunity for Virginians and visitors alike to experience the joy of fishing without the barrier of license fees,&#8221; stated VMRC Commissioner Jamie Green. &#8220;We encourage everyone to take advantage of this opportunity while also respecting our marine ecosystems and regulations.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those going after striped bass, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commissions, the regional authority regulating fisheries along the East Coast, earlier this month imposed a one-fish catch limit for recreational anglers. In the Chesapeake Bay, the catches must be between 19 and 24 inches, and along the Atlantic Coast, hauls must be between 28 inches and 31 inches. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conservation measures were put in place following research that found a continual decline in the number of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-researchers-find-low-number-of-juvenile-striped-bass-in-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">baby striped bass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What has everyone worried is that there are hardly any smaller striped bass growing up for anglers to catch in future years,” said Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Executive Director Chris Moore, in a statement following ASMFC’s </span><a href="https://www.cbf.org/news-media/newsroom/2024/all/as-striped-bass-concerns-continue-atlantic-states-marine-fisheries-commission-plans-next-steps.html?&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=comms" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “The last time the Chesapeake saw a strong group of young striped bass was back in 2015.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moore said big fish need to stay in the water,“to reproduce and rebuild the striped bass population so that they’ll be around in the future.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head boats, charter boats, rental boats, or fishing piers that typically charge a fee are excluded from the free fishing waiver.

(Photo courtesy of Kenny Fletcher/Chesapeake Bay Foundation)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2024 Bay-wide Blue Crab Winter Dredge Survey revealed last week shows the crustaceans are still below desired population levels, as the state’s Marine Resources Commission considers a request to maintain the same crabbing regulations in Virginia and opening a winter dredge season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VMRC Crab Management Advisory Committee voted last Wednesday afternoon to have the larger body consider allowing catches past December at its June meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, crabbing is only allowed between March through the middle of December in Virginia. The state had a winter dredging season up until 2008, when it was closed down following population lows that necessitated an emergency declaration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had been talking about it, trying to get it open…for January and February, and have a poundage cap on it, like 1.5 million [pounds],” said committee member Spencer Headley, who made the motion to extend the dredging season at last week’s meeting.. “And 1.5 million pounds would not hurt their overall population.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Chris Moore, Virginia executive director of the non-profit Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the state “had a long way” to go before considering all the implications of opening that option again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re coming out of a year where we’re two years removed from the lowest winter dredge survey we’ve ever had,” Moore said. “I don&#8217;t think we would be on solid footing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debate to reopen the winter fishery is focused around the increased value of crabs in those months, when there are fewer watermen pulling them in and other states like North and South Carolina allow fishermen to catch the blue crabs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The value is there,” said James Hudgins, president of the Virginia Waterman’s Association, in an interview with the Mercury while adding he was in support of the winter fishery for a limited number of boats, like 15 to 20. “You’re looking at double the amount of money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the debate also includes the catch controls environmental advocates want put in place following the winter survey results that counted 133 million females, about 60 million below desired targets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 28% of the female crabs in the population were caught in 2023, comprising what is known as the exploitation rate. Virginia has some leeway to allow more catches before a 37% exploitation rate is met and mandates conservation measures, Hudgins said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winter dredge survey uses the same dredging technique to pull the crabs up from the bottom for research purposes, but releases them to the water. This year’s dredge research survey found that the crab population had decreased from the previous year&#8217;s abundance of 323 million to 317 million, a 2% decrease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-term average for all crabs since the start of the survey is about 407 million, with the adult average being about 182 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, females — which are crucial to maintain because of their ability to continue producing offspring — were down from 152 million to 133 million, still below the target of 196 million. Males were also down from 55 million to 46 million. Juveniles showed a 16% increase to 138 million, but were still below an average of 207 million since the surveying began in 1900.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Marine Resources Commission said in a news </span><a href="https://mrc.virginia.gov/Notices/2024/2024-VMRC-Dredge-Survey-Media-Release.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that the adult female crab population was “continuing to surpass” average levels for the second year in a row but didn’t point out the other variations in numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling the results a “positive trend,” VMRC’s release highlighted the importance of closely monitoring and managing the adult female crabs. Commissioner Jamie Green said the state’s license-specific catch limits are important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This provides Virginia the flexibility to reduce regulatory burdens that would economically benefit the industry while maintaining the long-term conservation goals of the joint Chesapeake Bay jurisdictions,” Greene said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bay Foundation took a more measured tone on the results, noting the decline from last year and advocating for seagrass habitat improvement like water-filtering oysters and natural shoreline implementation “in order to help ensure better numbers in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Predation, particularly from catfish, can harm the species, too, but Alexa Galvan, VMRC fishery management planner, noted that the state has made efforts to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/blue-catfish-are-invasive-in-virginia-the-state-is-paying-to-get-more-of-them-on-peoples-tables/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the invasive catfish market and processing. A report from the Chesapeake Bay Stock Assessment </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/who/group/chesapeake-bay-stock-assessment-committee" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expected to be completed in 2026 with information on predatory impacts on crabs, and how climate change, rising sea levels and warming water temps affect the animals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think climate change is affecting all the seafood,” Hudgins said, referencing the warmer temps’ impact on their habitat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VMRC staff didn’t share specific information on how </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-regulators-considering-fall-crabbing-season-extension/https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-regulators-considering-fall-crabbing-season-extension/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extensions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made last year impacted the harvest for the 2023 season that started in July and saw 18.5 million pounds caught, a 13% increase from 2022, completed by 772 harvesters on 48,300 trips, a 5% increase. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That led to a $41 million dockside value for catches, which, adjusted for inflation,  was a 31% increase from the previous year. About 8% of harvests are estimated to come from recreational fishers, who are not allowed to use more than two pots at a time and aren’t required to report their catches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a regional effort with the Potomac River Fisheries Commission, and Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Virginia is committed to maintaining the “status quo” on catch limit regulations. Therefore, if the winter dredge season were to result in 1.5 million pounds caught, that much would have to be reduced from what could be caught during the regular fishing seasons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrie Hearne, of Richmond, will begin as executive director of the </span><a href="https://studies.virginiageneralassembly.gov/studies/211" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commission on Electric Utility Regulation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next month. She will take the role after five years at Virginia Energy, where she was the director of affordability and competitiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a pivotal time for the clean energy transition in Virginia, all while electricity </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is growing,” Hearne said in a statement. “The policy and regulatory landscape has a tremendous impact on whether and how energy projects get deployed across Virginia to ensure a reliable, affordable and clean energy system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax — the commission’s chair who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/05/after-six-years-of-inaction-virginia-commission-on-electric-utility-regulation-reconvenes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinvigorated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it through legislation in 2023 following years of dormancy — noted Hearne’s experience working for the state under both Democratic and Republican administrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;From load growth and energy demand to decarbonization and grid modernization, Virginia faces a string of energy challenges over the coming years that must be faced,&#8221; said Surovell in the statement. &#8220;Carrie brings a wealth of public- and private-sector energy policy experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Commission on Electric Utility Regulation, or CEUR, reviews requests to change Virginia&#8217;s energy laws and regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Virginia’s most comprehensive law regarding electricity generation from the state’s two largest utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, is the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/02/20/ten-things-to-know-about-the-clean-economy-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Clean Economy Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed under Democratic control in 2020 and seeks to decarbonize the electric grid by 2050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since passage of the VCEA, which sets targets for increasing electricity generation from renewable sources like solar and wind, several legislators have introduced measures to change electric utility laws and regulations. Those efforts haven’t made it through the legislative process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed changes included a bill this past session from Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, to require </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/in-virginia-new-debates-over-who-gets-the-final-say-on-solar-projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to consider proposals to convert land to solar use, so long as the land covered by panels took up no more than 4% of the locality’s total land. But members of the House of Delegates Committee on Counties, Cities and Towns subcommittee </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/27/bill-to-limit-local-restrictions-on-solar-projects-in-virginia-paused-for-more-study/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to continue the legislation to 2025 with a request for the CEUR to review it further because of the land use implications it may have had for localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other proposals sent to the CEUR in recent years included an option to have Dominion procure its next required amount of offshore </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/01/virginia-bill-to-let-non-utilities-supply-offshore-wind-energy-pushed-back-to-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electricity from a third party, a bill that advocates said can reduce costs. The utility, however, said it strayed away from the current regulated oversight, which is now being used for the $9.8 Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/30/federal-judge-denies-delay-to-dominions-offshore-wind-project/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> off the coast of Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEUR is also charged with creating ratepayer impact statements, reviewing Dominion’s and Appalachian Power’s Integrated Resource </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/12/dominion-regulator-recommends-rejection-of-utilitys-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — the non-binding long-term planning documents for future investments by the utilities — as well as receiving updates from the State Corporation Commission, which oversees Virginia’s utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, the CEUR heard a presentation from the U.S. Department of Energy on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/11/feds-pitch-virginia-on-loan-opportunities-for-renewable-energy-transition/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">loans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fund clean energy energy projects should the state establish a State Energy Financing Institution, a program that would’ve been created by legislation from Surovell this session that was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The governor had released his </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/10/04/youngkins-energy-plan-calls-for-reevaluation-of-clean-economy-act/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022 calling for continued use of natural gas and new forms of nuclear energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glenn Davis, a former legislator </span><a href="https://energy.virginia.gov/public/documents/newsroom/2023/Press_Release_Virginia_Energy_Welcomes_Glenn_Davis_as_Agency_Director20230501.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chosen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Youngkin to be the director of Virginia Department of Energy, said Hearne was “instrumental” in the state receiving an “unprecedented amount of federal grant dollars,” including $156 million under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Solar for All </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/23/president-biden-visits-prince-william-park-to-talk-solar-youth-involvement-on-earth-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She is a strong choice for executive director of CEUR and I look forward to working with her in her new role,” Davis said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarah Kesterson, a spokeswoman for Virginia Energy, said the agency will “very soon” be advertising on their website and social media the vacancy Hearne’s hiring creates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a crucial role to our state energy office and the agency,” Kesterson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another recent addition to the commission is Josephus Allmond, a staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. Allmond joins Cassidy Rasnick and Howard Shafferman as the other citizen members who sit on the board alongside the legislative members.</span></p>
