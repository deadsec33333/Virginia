(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">Members of Congress are among those calling for greater transparency from the federal government as a spate of reported drone sightings concentrated in New Jersey and New York has raised questions beyond the Northeast.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reported sightings of drones, officially known as unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, have spiked since Nov. 18, when authorities received several reports of suspicious drone activity near critical infrastructure in New Jersey, according to an FBI official in the state who briefed reporters over the weekend.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The increased activity has worried some and led to calls from lawmakers for the federal agencies to provide more information on drone activity, even as security officials urged caution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a statement that described an “epidemic of non-stop drone sightings,” U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the federal government to deploy more drone-detection systems and to share information with local authorities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I want it deployed widely across New York and New Jersey to help give us concrete answers on what is going on, and from where,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said of a drone-detection system that the federal government uses. “What we need right now is data. The briefings I have had tell me there is no evidence that this is a government or foreign activity, and so, we have to answer the logical of question of: who?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Schumer called on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to deploy the drone-detection system and said he would cosponsor a bill that would give local law enforcement more authority to respond to drone sightings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Drones, like planes and other users of the national airspace, are regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We still have very few answers on where some of these drones come from and who may be operating them,” Schumer said Monday on the Senate floor. “The people of New York and New Jersey have a lot of questions and haven’t gotten many answers. We know one thing, though. Local officials now don’t have the resources nor the authority to get to the bottom of what’s happening.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">On CBS’ Sunday morning news show “Face the Nation,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is a senior member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee with jurisdiction over the FAA, called for federal officials to brief U.S. senators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We need more transparency,” she said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">‘No evidence’ of threat, says DOD</h4>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Defense Department spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters Monday that there was “no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Regardless, he said he wanted to take the public’s concerns seriously, but also offered further context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The drone industry is expanding, with more than 1 million hobbyist and commercial drones licensed by the FAA and 8,000 in use daily.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He likened the drone sightings, even those near military installations or other important sites, to drivers who may get lost and turn up in their cars at places they are not supposed to be, something he said happens regularly without incident.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The point being is that flying drones is not illegal,” he said. “There are thousands of drones flown around the U.S. on a daily basis. So, as a result, it’s not that unusual to see drones in the sky, nor is it an indication of malicious activity or any public safety threat.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, noted Monday that federal investigators had not found any malicious activity and <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/12/16/governor-murphy-asks-public-to-calm-down-over-drone-sightings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urged residents to “calm down”</a> about drone sightings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many recent reports of drones, noted by non-experts, turned out to be commercial planes flying regularly scheduled nighttime routes.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">More than 5,000 tips</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The New Jersey-based FBI official said that the vast majority of the more than 5,000 tips his office received in the past month related to unidentified objects in the night skies have not been “actionable.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The official, who briefed reporters along with officials from other agencies on the condition their names not be used, said the FBI was working to identify the 100 or so tips that did warrant further investigation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t want to cause alarm and panic, but you can’t ignore the sightings that have been there, and we are concerned about those just as much as anybody else is,” the FBI official said. “We’re doing our best to find the origin of that specific — of those drone activities. But I think there has been a slight overreaction.”</p>

(Photo Illustration by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">The law Congress passed this year to force the Chinese parent company of social media giant TikTok to either sell the service or face a U.S. ban is constitutional, a panel of federal appeals judges ruled Friday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/opinions/docs/2024/12/24-1113-2088317.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order</a> from a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals preserves the bipartisan <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&#038;r=1&#038;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law</a> President Joe Biden signed in April forcing ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, to cease operations in the United States over concerns the platform’s data gathering could be obtained and used by the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TikTok, ByteDance and a handful of users <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/tiktok-sues-block-new-us-law-banning-app-if-it-not-sold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued the administration to block</a> enforcement of the law, saying <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-silenced-free-speech-tiktok-law-platform-tells-federal-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it violated the First Amendment</a> right to free speech and other rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The panel on Friday rejected that argument, saying that although the short-form videos produced on the service constitute speech and the shuttering of U.S. operations would limit that speech, that was the result of the Chinese government’s “hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security,” not the U.S. government’s actions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,” Senior Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg wrote for the panel. “Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ginsburg, who was appointed to the court by Republican President Ronald Reagan, and Neomi Rao, a Donald Trump appointee, formed the court’s main opinion. Chief Judge Sri Srinavasan, whom Democrat Barack Obama appointed, wrote a concurring opinion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TikTok has the option to appeal Friday’s ruling to the full D.C. Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court. The law is set to go into effect Jan. 19, the day before Trump — who has said he opposes the law even after trying his own TikTok ban during his first presidency — retakes office.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Free speech concerns</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Those challenging the law are likely to appeal directly to the Supreme Court and to seek an emergency temporary stay, “given the urgency of the situation,” Jacob Huebert, who represents a plaintiff in the case, said in a Friday interview.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Huebert is the president of Liberty Justice Center, a nonprofit that has litigated high-profile free-speech cases and is representing the libertarian news and commentary channel BASEDPolitics in the TikTok case, arguing that the law unconstitutionally restricts the channel’s reach to its intended audience of Gen Z users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The government’s national security argument should not have overridden the First Amendment concerns, Huebert said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This national security justification that the court relied so heavily on isn’t enough,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The law would set a dangerous precedent that could be applied in the future to other social media, he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It should trouble you regardless of what you think about TikTok or China in particular because it’s really a threat to Americans’ free speech rights online, across the board,” Huebert said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Bill sponsors from both parties praise ruling</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The bipartisan leaders of the U.S. House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, where the bill was introduced, cheered the decision Friday in a joint statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Today’s ruling is a victory for the American people and TikTok users, and a loss for the Chinese Communist Party, which will no longer be able to exploit ByteDance’s control over TikTok to undermine our sovereignty, surveil our citizens, and threaten our national security,” Chairman John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican, wrote. “I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ranking Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois said there is no solution other than a sale of TikTok.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“With today’s opinion, all three branches of government have reached the same conclusion: ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, and TikTok’s ownership by ByteDance is a national security threat that cannot be mitigated through any other means than divestiture,” he said. “Every day that TikTok remains under the Chinese Communist Party’s control is a day that our security is at risk.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was introduced in March by then-Chair Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who has since left Congress, and Krishnamoorthi.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It has dozens of co-sponsors from each party and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-ban-tiktok-unless-it-sold-china-controlled-parent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> the House 352-65. The Senate <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/aid-ukraine-israel-overwhelmingly-approved-us-house-bipartisan-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleared the bill in April</a> as part of a larger funding package.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113546215051155542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pair</a> of <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113546215408213585" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posts</a> to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Monday evening, Trump said on his first day in office he would impose 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on goods from China until those countries stopped the flow of illegal drugs and migrants into the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,” Trump wrote. “On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders. This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Trump has not always followed through on threats of stiff tariffs — generating doubts about how severe the next round will actually be — the executive branch does have wide latitude to impose the taxes on foreign goods without congressional approval, meaning it is likely Trump will act in some way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are going to get several tariff threats via rage-posts over the next four years,” Brendan Duke, a senior director for economic policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, said in an interview. “Unclear what exact levels on what exact countries he is going to pursue.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">What about inflation?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Tariffs are consistent with Trump’s preference for a protectionist trade policy, but may actively hurt in an area that was key to his election win over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris this month: taming inflation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An analysis from the Center for American Progress said the tariffs Trump announced Monday would raise annual costs for the average U.S. family by $1,300.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democratic members of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees tax and trade policy, estimated tariffs favored by Trump would increase consumer costs by up to $4,000 per year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to CBS News exit polling, 78% of voters said inflation was a moderate or severe hardship. Trump won voters who rated the economy as bad by 40 points over Harris.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Cars, ag and energy to be hardest-hit</h4>
<p dir="ltr">About 15% of goods consumed in the United States are imported, Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, an economics research center, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adding across-the-board tariffs on those imports would contribute to consumers’ overall cost of living, even without considering related economic consequences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You’ve added to inflation, and that’s assuming that U.S. producers of similar products don’t jack up their prices,” he said. “But experience shows that if the economy is strong, they’ll do just that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The U.S. automotive sector, which is heavily integrated with Mexico and Canada with parts of a single vehicle produced in all three countries, could see “pretty startling” price increases, Hufbauer said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the U.S. imports Mexican fruits and vegetables and Canadian oil, complicating Trump’s campaign promise to bring down prices specifically of groceries and gas, Duke said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Americans have obviously been frustrated with the cost of food and the cost of gas,” he said. “Some parts of the United States are heavily reliant on Canadian oil, even though we’re a net exporter … So, one would expect price increases, especially in places like the Midwest that are heavily dependent on Canadian oil.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tariffs on Chinese goods would increase the costs of electronics, clothing and other consumer goods, Duke said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Democratic legislation</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Ways and Means Democrats, led by Washington’s Suzan DelBene and Virginia’s Don Beyer, and also joined by Earl Blumenauer of Oregon, Terri Sewell of Alabama, Steven Horsford of Nevada, Dan Kildee of Michigan and four others, introduced a bill Tuesday to rein in the executive’s ability to implement tariffs, citing the added cost to American families.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The American people have clearly and consistently said that costs are one of their top concerns,” DelBene said in a statement. “Imposing sweeping tariffs on imported goods would raise prices on consumer products by thousands of dollars a year according to estimates. Not only would widespread tariffs drive up costs at home and likely send our economy into recession, but they would damage our trade relationships with allies and likely lead to significant retaliation, hurting American workers, farmers, and businesses.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s promises of dramatic tariffs go beyond the intent of the law that gave the president the power to enact tariffs, the Democrats said. Congress wanted a president to be able to quickly impose tariffs on hostile foreign countries, but did not intend “to allow a president to indiscriminately impose tariffs without Congress’ approval.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tariffs can be an important tool for conducting foreign policy, but the range Trump is proposing is 10 to 20 times beyond what even he did in his first term, Duke said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He cautioned that the final form of new tariffs may not be exactly what Trump proposed Monday night, though they could be similar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He’s gonna do something on tariffs. I don’t know what. It’s probably not these exact levels on these exact countries,” he said. “But it rhymes with it.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The House Judiciary Committee unanimously approved it last year and it passed the House by voice vote in January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“REPUBLICANS MUST KILL THIS BILL!” Trump wrote on his social media site, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113516968142292237" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truth Social</a>, in all capital letters on Wednesday, linking to a PBS segment about the measure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Substantial floor time is generally required in the Senate to bypass the process that allows a single member to hold up the chamber’s business. With Democrats prioritizing confirmation of Biden’s judicial nominees before they lose their majority in January, it is unlikely they would bring a vote on the measure without the unanimous consent of all 100 senators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s influence within the Senate Republican Conference makes reaching unanimous consent exceedingly unlikely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill’s House sponsor, California Republican Kevin Kiley, accepted the bill’s defeat in a statement Thursday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Based on the feedback we’ve received from Senators and President Trump, it’s clear we have work to do to achieve consensus on this issue,” he said. “I’m looking forward to working with the new Administration on a great many areas of common ground as we begin a new era of American prosperity.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A Kiley spokesperson declined to provide further details about senators’ feedback on the measure. A spokesperson for U.S. Senate Judiciary ranking Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina did not respond to a message seeking comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the House, 19 members from both parties, including Republicans Barry Moore of Alabama, Darrell Issa of California, Russell Fry of South Carolina and Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota and Democrats Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Ted Lieu of California and Rashida Tlaib and Dan Kildee of Michigan, signed on as cosponsors.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Protection for local journalists</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Jon Schleuss, the president of The NewsGuild-CWA, a national journalists’ union that has supported the bill, noted in <a href="https://newsguild.org/the-press-act-protects-all-american-voices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Thursday statement</a> it would protect news sources across the political spectrum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Americans would not know about the corruption of former Democratic Senator Bob Menendez or former Republican Representative George Santos without the hard work of local journalists holding power to account,” he said. “All of us depend on journalism, especially local journalism, to shine a light and protect Americans from threats, both foreign and domestic. The PRESS Act protects all voices: news sources, whistleblowers and the journalists they talk to from media outlets across the spectrum.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a Thursday statement to States Newsroom, Gabe Rottman, policy director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, called the bill a “reasonable and common-sense measure” that enjoyed broad bipartisan support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Its passage would put an end to actions the Justice Department has taken under past administrations of both parties to target reporters’ confidential communications when investigating and prosecuting disclosures of government information,” he wrote. “We urge Congress to recognize that there is still a need for a legislative remedy here.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Press advocacy groups have expressed worries about Trump’s return to the White House, citing a record in his first term that included surveillance of and legal threats against journalists and news organizations.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Seeking retribution</h4>
<p dir="ltr">In the closing days of the presidential race, Trump <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2024/11/03/as-presidential-campaign-rockets-toward-end-7-big-things-that-happened-this-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fantasized aloud</a> about reporters being shot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Press freedom groups also worry that Trump’s promises to use the federal bureaucracy to seek retribution against perceived enemies would extend to journalists.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In his second term, Trump will make good on these anti-press threats to try to destroy any news outlet, journalist, or whistleblower who criticizes or opposes him,” Seth Stern, the director of advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, wrote in <a href="https://freedom.press/issues/trump-will-try-to-destroy-press-freedom-we-wont-let-him/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Nov. 6 blog post</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stern added that Trump would “almost certainly repeal” the protections against surveillance the Department of Justice had put in place during President Joe Biden’s term.</p>

(Getty photos, of Harris by Justin Sullivan and of Trump by Chip Somodevilla)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump was poised early Wednesday to once again assume the Oval Office after American voters delivered wins in the swing states of North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania, according to projections from The Associated Press.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump led with 267 Electoral College votes overall nationally, eclipsing Democratic nominee Vice President Harris’ 224, just before 3 a.m. Eastern, according to the AP. A total of 270 votes are needed to win.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Associated Press had not yet projected results for the other battleground states of Arizona, Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin. Trump, however, held leads in all four. Alaska’s three electoral votes are reliably Republican and were expected in the morning hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Decision Desk HQ and Fox News also called Wisconsin for Trump, which would give him an Electoral College victory. The AP and other media that project election winners, including NBC News, CNN and The New York Times, had not called the race by 3 a.m. Eastern.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All results are unofficial until local election officials across the country <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">verify and certify</a> the outcome in the <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-certification-deadlines" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">coming days and weeks</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump declared victory at his election night party just before 3 a.m. Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though votes in key swing states were still being counted, the speech signaled the end of an extraordinary presidential contest defined by Trump’s <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/11/04/trump-more-than-ever-mixes-anger-fear-and-insults-to-stir-supporters-say-researchers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">divisive</a> rhetoric, his <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CRIMINAL-INDICTMENT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">numerous</a> <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/07/15/federal-judge-dismisses-trump-classified-documents-criminal-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">criminal</a> <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/09/05/judge-in-trumps-jan-6-case-says-it-wont-be-delayed-by-upcoming-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">cases</a> and <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-assassination-attempt-on-trump-at-butler-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">two</a> <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2024/09/16/man-arrested-after-poking-rifle-onto-trump-golf-course-charged-with-federal-gun-crimes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">attempts</a> on his life. The race took an unprecedented turn when President Joe Biden, following a disastrous debate performance, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://arkansasadvocate.com/2024/07/21/breaking-president-joe-biden-bows-out-of-reelection-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">dropped</a> his reelection bid with just over 100 days until the election, jolting the Trump camp to pivot to Harris.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump promises to ‘heal’</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump amassed electoral votes shortly after polls closed in states forecast in his favor, and picked up critical wins in key battlegrounds when the AP projected victories for him in <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/11/05/ap-trump-wins-north-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">North Carolina</a> just before midnight, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/11/06/after-bitter-defeat-in-2020-trump-comes-back-to-win-georgia-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Georgia</a> at about 1 a.m., and <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/donald-trump-projected-to-win-pennsylvanias-19-electoral-votes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Pennsylvania</a> just before 2:30 a.m. Trump won the key states in his successful 2016 campaign but lost them in his failed reelection bid in 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking to his supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, Trump thanked “thousands of friends in this incredible movement like nobody’s ever seen before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Frankly, this was, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time. There&#8217;s never been anything like this in this country,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump promised to “heal” the country and that his second presidency “will truly be the golden age of America.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We overcame obstacles that nobody thought possible,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During his roughly 25-minute speech, Trump thanked his family and campaign staff, and invited his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, and Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship, to speak on stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vance, poised to become Trump’s vice president, said a new administration would usher in an economic “comeback” for the U.S.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think we just witnessed the greatest political comeback in the history of the United States of America,” Vance said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">White thanked popular podcast host Joe Rogan for his election eve endorsement of Trump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is what happens when the machine comes after you,” White said. “This is karma, ladies and gentlemen.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris to speak Wednesday</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">As election night turned into early Wednesday, the previously energetic crowd at Howard <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-watch-party-dc-hope-gives-way-anxiety" target="_blank">started to dwindle</a>. Once campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond announced Harris would not be speaking at the party, the last stragglers left in waves, the mood quickly souring.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond said that Harris would address supporters and the nation later Wednesday, and tried to give a small pep talk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We still have votes to count,” he said. “We still have states that have not been called yet.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In reference to reports that Harris’ watch party had begun to wind down, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt commented on X “sounds like joy has left the building…” The word “joy” was a rallying cry among the Harris camp and supporters during her whirlwind campaign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Billionaire Elon Musk, a major funder and surrogate for the Trump campaign, posted on his platform X a photo of a launching rocket ship along with the words, “The future is gonna be fantastic.” Shortly before that he posted a photoshopped image of himself hauling a sink into the Oval Office with the message, “Let that sink in.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘I don’t feel as hopeful’</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Harris had planned to spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University in Washington, D.C., where her supporters gathered, but she never left from the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory, according to press pool reports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Early in the evening, Lalika Gerald, a Howard graduate from 2005, remembers studying TV production in the library that is now overlooking an election night rally for potentially the first Black woman to lead the country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s a very exciting time just to be here and to know that a Bison like myself is about to be our president,” she said, referring to the university’s mascot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 41-year-old from Prince George’s County, Maryland, said she has felt a roller coaster of emotions throughout the day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As excited and as hopeful as I am, you know you never know what might happen,” she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a moment for us to be really seen.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By the time the event ended around 1 a.m., Harris supporters’ said the hope they felt at the start of the evening had left.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t know what’s happening, but it’s very stressful right now,” Liane Crosey said as she left the watch party. “Seeing the numbers coming in, I don’t feel as hopeful.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A convicted felon in the Oval Office</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump is positioned to make history as the first-ever <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2024/05/30/breaking-trump-found-guilty-on-34-felony-counts-in-ny-hush-money-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">convicted</a> felon elected to the presidency. His long presidential campaign tangled with a busy legal calendar that included two federal cases, still <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/10/03/special-counsel-jack-smith-reveals-new-evidence-against-trump-in-2020-election-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">ongoing</a>, and cases in Georgia and New York. The former president was convicted in New York in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election. His sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 26.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump ascended on the campaign trail despite facing federal felony charges for scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Four years ago, Trump refused to concede to Biden in 2020 and lost dozens of court cases challenging the results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His repetition of the lie that the 2020 was “stolen” from him became a main feature of his campaign rallies in 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The major policy area he focused on during the campaign was curtailing immigration, and he promised to conduct mass deportations of immigrants in the country illegally. Trump and Vance also targeted legal immigrants, including by amplifying the debunked rumor that Haitians with Temporary Protected Status in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump also pledged to ramp up tariffs, taxes on goods produced overseas, in an effort to boost U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump and campaign officials tried to distance the candidate from a comprehensive conservative policy blueprint written by the Heritage Foundation, a Washington think tank. The plan calls for restructuring the federal government to empower the president, further restricting abortion access and limiting immigration, among other proposals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump would likely enjoy friendly lawmakers in Washington over the next two years, as Republicans were <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/republicans-take-majority-control-us-senate-after-ohio-west-virginia-victories" target="_blank">projected to win</a> control of the U.S. Senate. Control of the House remained unknown early Wednesday,</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite several U.S. House races remaining too close to call, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana issued a written statement declaring “There is hope and morning in America again!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Donald Trump is now our President-elect, chosen by the American people for such a time as this. The citizens of our great country used their voices to decisively reject four more years of Harris’ open borders, high crime, increased cost of living, weaponized government, dangerous radical woke ideology, and weakness on the world stage &#8211; demanding instead, a return to common sense, peace, and prosperity,” Johnson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump is not officially president-elect until election results are certified.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In the states</h4>

	</h4>
<p dir="ltr">States Newsroom journalists fanned out across the country Tuesday, talking to voters outside churches, community centers, schools and courthouses, where the presidential race not only weighed on their minds, but congressional contests and ballot initiatives as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voter Stephanie Capps in Raleigh, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/election-day-in-battleground-nc-voters-reflect-on-history-and-the-future-theyd-like-to-see/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">North Carolina</a>, said she brought her 9-year-old daughter to the polls to show her democracy in action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Because a little over 100 years ago, women couldn’t vote,” Capps told NC Newsline. “And so, we talked about how it’s really important for her to learn to vote.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The presidential campaigns continued to hit swing states, speak to the press and issue statements reminding voters of their rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris stayed in Washington, D.C, where she called in to several radio shows in battleground states. According to her campaign, she was a guest on Power 99 in Philadelphia with Cappuchino and KDKA NewsRadio in Pittsburgh with Larry Richert, the Big Tigger Morning Show in Atlanta, Georgia and Foxy 107.2 with Karen Clark in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m proud to have a lot of support out of Pittsburgh, it’s a historic city,” Harris <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://x.com/KDKARadio/status/1853814481379266648" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">told</a> Richert, who asked about her 10 campaign visits to the western Pennsylvania city.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, stopped in Harrisburg, <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/election-day-2024-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">Pennsylvania</a>, Tuesday where he spoke to supporters and volunteers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Walz told reporters after the event “I think the choice couldn’t be starker.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump <a class="ext" title="(opens in a new window)" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/113432133120615756" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-extlink="">posted</a> video messages on his platform Truth Social throughout Tuesday reminding voters to remain in line if they arrive before polls close.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Republicans, we’re doing very well. Stay on line, don’t get off line, and vote. Make sure you get through and vote. We’re gonna have a big victory tonight,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden, who was the presumed Democratic nominee until he dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris just over 100 days ago, did not make any public appearances Tuesday.</p>

(Jeenah Moon/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — On the final frantic Sunday of the presidential race, while Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a Black church service in Michigan, former President Donald Trump told supporters at a Pennsylvania rally that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House after he lost the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>At a campaign rally at an airplane tarmac in Lititz, Pennsylvania, Trump again perpetuated the falsehood that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him and claimed that this year’s election would also be stolen because election results could take a while to be counted.</p>
<p>“These elections have to be decided by 9 o’clock, 10 o’clock, 11 o’clock on Tuesday night,” he said. “Bunch of crooked people.”</p>
<p>Election officials have warned that<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/final-results-may-lag-deadlocked-presidential-contest-anxious-election-officials-warn" target="_blank"> results could take days to finalize.</a></p>
<p>The comments came as new polls showed good news for Harris. A highly regarded pollster in Iowa showed a shocking lead for Harris there and New York Times-Siena College polls of the seven major battleground states showed slight leads for Harris in some Sun Belt swing states, while Trump made gains in the Rust Belt.</p>
<p>As the campaign dwindles to its final hours, here are seven key developments from this weekend:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump says he ‘shouldn’t have left’ White House</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump spent much of his Lititz rally complaining about the election process and media coverage, seeming to repeat his false claim that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have left, I mean, honestly,” Trump said. “We did so well, we had such a great — so now, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.”</p>
<p>He also <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/pennsylvania-lititz-lancaster-trump-rants-about-polls-says-i-dont-mind-if-someone-shoots-through-the-fake-news-at-pa-rally/" target="_blank">joked about shooters targeting reporters</a> covering his event, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.</p>
<p>He pointed to protective glass covering him on two sides and noted a press section was on another side of him.</p>
<p>“To get me, someone would have to shoot through the fake news,” Trump said. “And I don’t mind that so much.”</p>
<p>In a statement that seemed to contradict the plain meaning of Trump’s remark, campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung denied Trump was encouraging violence against reporters.</p>
<p>“The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else,” Cheung wrote. “It was about threats against him that were spurred on by dangerous rhetoric from Democrats. In fact, President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris heads to the Big Apple</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Harris made an unscheduled trip to New York City Saturday, where she made a surprise appearance during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Funs6yyEw" target="_blank">cold open of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live”</a> alongside actress Maya Rudolph, who portrays the veep in the live sketch comedy show.</p>
<p>In the three-minute opener, Rudolph approaches a vanity dresser and wishes she could talk to “someone who was in my shoes” as a “Black, South Asian woman running for president, preferably from the Bay Area.”</p>
<p>Rudolph turns toward the faux mirror, and Harris, on the other side, responds, “You and me both, sister.”</p>
<p>They wore identical suits and Harris turned to Rudolph and said that she is “here to remind you, you got this.”</p>
<p>“Because you can do something your opponent cannot do. You can open doors,” Harris said, joking about a recent campaign event where Trump tried to open the door to a garbage truck.</p>
<p>Rudolph cackled, doing an impersonation of Harris’ laugh, before the two women began a pep talk with puns of Harris’ first name.</p>
<p>“Now, Kamala, take my palmala,” Rudolph said. “The American people want to stop the chaos.”</p>
<p>“And end the dramala,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Harris and Rudolph then stood side-by-side and said they were going to vote for “us.”</p>
<p>Harris joked and asked Rudolph if she was registered to vote in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Harris headed from New York to Michigan, where she spoke Sunday at the historically Black Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ in Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polling bombshell in a non-swing state</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Polling in the latest <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/iowa-poll-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-2024-presidential-race/75354033007/" target="_blank">Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll</a>, reported a shocking lead for Harris in a state that Trump easily won in 2016 and 2020, with women and independent voters breaking for the Democratic presidential nominee.</p>
<p>The poll shows Harris leading with 47% of likely voters compared to 44% with Trump, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-final-iowa-poll-2024-election" target="_blank">according to the Register.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.nucleusfiles.com/a4/a4f946f9-4e27-4bae-8e32-e77638040f06/11.2-djt-iowa-poll.pdf?_nlid=S2fMS533ZU&amp;_nhids=g2dmirPedj" target="_blank">The Trump campaign </a>quickly called the Iowa poll “a clear outlier,” and instead cited a <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/november-2024-iowa-poll-trump-53-harris-43/" target="_blank">poll by Emerson College </a>as accurate, which showed the former president having 53% support compared to 43% for Harris.</p>
<p>Trump also took his grievances to his social media site, Truth Social.</p>
<p>“All polls, except for one heavily skewed toward the Democrats by a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time, have me up, BY A LOT,” he wrote. “I LOVE THE FARMERS, AND THEY LOVE ME.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html" target="_blank">The New York Times/Siena College Sunday polls</a> found that Harris is improving in North Carolina and Georgia while Trump has gained in Pennsylvania and maintains a strong advantage in Arizona. Harris is still ahead in Nevada and Wisconsin, according to the poll, but Michigan and Pennsylvania remain tied. The poll of Georgia showed Harris with a 1-point edge.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Harris expands her lead over Trump to 10 points in Virginia, new Roanoke College poll says&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/01/harris-expands-her-lead-over-trump-to-10-points-in-virginia-new-roanoke-college-poll-says/embed/#?secret=yeSCzbu3BC#?secret=0xReBV1PDY" data-secret="0xReBV1PDY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Both candidates were within the polls’ margins of error, meaning that the seven swing states could tip to either candidate.</p>
<p>While both Democratic and Republican politicians have expressed confidence in winning the election, polling experts said during a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?539658-1/political-analysts-discuss-2024-elections&amp;live" target="_blank">panel</a> hosted by the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute in late October there’s no way to know for sure who will control the White House until all the votes are counted.</p>
<p>Kristen Soltis Anderson, founding partner at Echelon Insights, said there’s about a 60% chance that this year’s nationwide polling has been mostly correct, though she emphasized that the people who focus their careers on political polling are dedicated to providing a realistic understanding of where campaigns are headed.</p>
<p>“We are trying our very hardest to get it right,” Anderson said. “Even if you don’t believe in our altruism or even if you don’t believe in our academic and intellectual integrity, believe in nothing else than our financial incentives. You want to be the pollster who was right. It is very good business to be the pollster who is right.”</p>
<p>Jeff Horwitt, partner at Hart Research, said during the panel his firm has wrapped up its polling for this election year and expressed skepticism about the polls that emerge close to Election Day.</p>
<p>“Because our job, for our political clients, is to tell them the contours of the election,” Horwitt said. “How do we convince voters to vote for our candidate? What are the most effective messages? What do we have to think about? So the public polls are seeing now, they’re super interesting, and they’re important, but they’re not actionable.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump welcomes sexist insult</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As Trump spent his weekend in a campaign blitz across North Carolina, he welcomed a sexist remark from a rallygoer in Greensboro who suggested that Harris worked as a prostitute.</p>
<p>During the Saturday night rally, Trump questioned whether Harris’ previously worked at a McDonald’s. Her campaign has stated that she worked the summer job in 1983. In a campaign photo opportunity, <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/trump-weekend-pennsylvania-arnold-palmer-latrobe-mcdonalds-steelers-elon-musk/" target="_blank">Trump visited a closed McDonald’s </a>in Pennsylvania where he handed fries to pre-screened people at the drive through.</p>
<p>“It’s so simple,” Trump said. “She’s a significant liar, and when you lie about something so simple, so she never worked there –”</p>
<p>“She worked on a corner,” a man from the crowd shouted.</p>
<p>Trump laughed at the crude comment.</p>
<p>“This place is amazing,” Trump said. “Just remember, it’s other people saying it, it’s not me.”</p>
<p>Harris has significantly gained support with women, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/10/10/the-harris-trump-matchup/" target="_blank">according to the Pew Research Center. </a>Trump has often dismissed criticism that he has lagged among women.</p>
<p>During a rally last week in Wisconsin, and in an attempt to win over women voters, Trump said that he would protect women and “I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump repeats ‘father of fertilization’ claim</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>At a Greensboro, North Carolina, rally Saturday, Trump again called himself “the father of fertilization,” a title <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-claims-title-father-ivf-fox-news-town-hall-women-voters" target="_blank">he first gave himself</a> during a Fox News town hall with women voters last month.</p>
<p>“I consider myself to be the father of fertilization,” he said Saturday.</p>
<p>The Iowa poll — and other late surveys — showed a stark gender gap, with women voters increasingly preferring Harris.</p>
<p>Nearly twice as many Iowa independent women voters, 57% to 29%, favored Harris. That represents a major gain for Harris since a September survey by the same pollster showed the vice president’s edge with independent women was only 5 percentage points.</p>
<p>Democrats have sought to exploit their advantage with women voters by emphasizing Trump’s record on abortion access. The former president appointed three of the U.S. Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn the federal right to an abortion.</p>
<p>A flurry of state-level policymaking on reproductive rights has followed, including restrictions on in vitro fertilization, a common fertility treatment.</p>
<p>Trump has said he opposed an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that outlawed the treatment in the state, but had not previously taken a position on the issue.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Early voters up to 76 million</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>More than 76 million voters had already cast ballots through early and mail voting by midday Sunday, according to <a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/early-vote/2024-early-voting/" target="_blank">the University of Florida’s Election Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Roughly half of those have come in states that track voters’ partisanship. About 700,000 — roughly 2% of the total — more Democrats have voted in those states than Republicans, but the numbers include California, where Democrat Joe Biden won more than 5 million more votes than Trump in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Among the six states — Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Colorado, Idaho and Virginia — that track voters’ gender, women accounted for 54% of the vote, compared to 43.6% for men.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed"> ‘Election eve’ blitz</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The candidates for president and vice president plan to sprint across the key swing states in the campaign’s final days, with particular focus on Pennsylvania, the largest of the contested states where polling has shown a deadlocked race.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign announced Sunday the vice president would be in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on Monday, the night before Election Day, for rallies and musical performances. Scheduled entertainers and speakers included Oprah Winfrey, The Roots, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.</p>
<p>Harris is also set to hold an event in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a majority-Latino city, on Monday. Part of Harris’ closing message has highlighted racist comments Trump and his supporters have made about Latinos.</p>
<p>After spending much of the weekend in North Carolina, Trump will also hold a rally in Pittsburgh on Monday evening.</p>
<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, will be in Milwaukee on Monday.</p>
<p>Trump running mate Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance will hold events in Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania on Monday.</p>
<p>Harris will hold an election night watch party at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Trump’s watch party will be at his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>

(Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)</p><p>The Democratic National Committee will send $2.5 million to more than 30 of its state and territorial parties in the closing weeks of the 2024 election cycle, the DNC said in a Friday statement.</p>
<p>With the new grants, national Democrats will have contributed to all 57 state and territorial chapters for the first time in a presidential cycle, according to the party.</p>
<p>“From the school board to the White House, the DNC is doing the work to elect Democrats to office at all levels of government,” DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said in the statement, given to States Newsroom ahead of a wider announcement.</p>
<p>“We are the only committee responsible for building Democratic infrastructure to win elections across the map, and with a new $2.5 million in grants, the DNC is delivering a multi-million dollar investment across all 57 state parties this cycle – a historic first for our committee.”</p>
<p>The new grants go beyond the seven swing states considered ultra-competitive in the presidential election that have gotten the lion’s share of attention and spending at the national level — and the handful with key U.S. Senate races that have also attracted a national focus.</p>
<p>Though some grants are relatively small, they represent a commitment by the national party to states across the country, including traditionally red states, Democrats said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Field workers in Idaho</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In Idaho, where Democrats hold just 18 of the 105 seats in the Legislature, a more-than $70,000 commitment from the national party will fund two field workers to reach Hispanic voters in two rural counties and tribal members on the Nez Perce Reservation, state party chair and state Rep. Lauren Necochea said.</p>
<p>Necochea, who spoke with States Newsroom in a Thursday interview ahead of the official announcement, said the funding was significant both for the symbolism of the national party’s investment in the overwhelmingly Republican state and for campaign operations this fall.</p>
<p>“We’re just gratified to see that this investment hit all 57 states and territories for the first time … so that no state is left behind,” she said. “We’re a traditionally red state, and that means we need the funding to fight back.”</p>
<p>The two organizers funded by the national money will help boost turnout in the state’s four battleground state legislative districts, Necochea said.</p>
<p>“This level of investment is also meaningful when it comes to winning races and getting out the vote,” she said, noting that a race in the last cycle was decided by 37 votes.</p>
<p>The outcomes in those races could determine which faction of the state’s Republican Party — either the hard right or the more moderate wing — will control the legislative agenda next session, she said.</p>
<p>The Democratic minority in the Legislature sometimes partners with moderate Republicans on legislation to fund education and health care programs, including maintaining the state’s Medicaid expansion, Necochea said.</p>
<p>“It is essential for state government to continue operating that we have a critical mass of Democrats in the Idaho Legislature,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other grants</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The DNC provided a partial list of the spending included in Friday’s announcement. State parties are free to use the funds as they wish, a DNC spokesman said. The national party noted some state organizations had already determined how to allocate the money.</p>
<p>Many state organizations planned to pursue outreach to voters of color, including in tribal communities.</p>
<p>Some examples of the spending and objectives, according to the DNC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Florida: More than $400,000 for statewide programs targeting “key coalitions.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Oregon: $125,000 to help the state party’s efforts in three key U.S. House races.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Pennsylvania: $100,000 “to supercharge voter outreach” in the only presidential battleground state on the new list. A portion of the funding will target the state’s large Puerto Rican community, the DNC said.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Minnesota: At least $100,000 to boost the state’s paid canvassing campaign. The new funding brings the total DNC allocation to the state to about $630,000, according to the party. The canvassing effort will help protect Democrats’ slim majorities in both legislative chambers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Missouri: “Nearly $100,000” for new organizing staff focused on breaking GOP supermajorities in both statehouse chambers and passing <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/09/25/amendment-3-challenges-abortion-missouri-legislation/" target="_blank">an abortion ballot measure</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Maryland: $75,000 for the state party’s mail program, with a focus on reaching Asian American and Pacific Islander voters, a growing segment of the state’s voting base, the DNC said. The DNC noted its support for U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks, calling her race against former GOP Gov. Larry Hogan critical to protecting reproductive rights.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>South Carolina: More than $70,000 for a get-out-the-vote staffer, focusing on outreach to new voters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Maine: $61,250 for three staffers to focus get-out-the-vote efforts in rural parts of U.S. Rep. Jared Golden’s swing district.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Arkansas: Nearly $60,000 to hire six coalition directors targeting young, Black and Latino voters, including Spanish-speaking organizers. It’s the first DNC spending in Arkansas this cycle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Louisiana: $55,000 for an organizer to help the state party reach voters in the new majority-Black 6th Congressional District.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Kansas: $50,000 for paid canvassing efforts to break GOP supermajorities in both legislative chambers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Oklahoma: $50,000 to help the state party’s outreach to tribal communities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Virginia: $50,000 for the state party’s get-out-the-vote and voter contact programs, focusing on two competitive U.S. House races: <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/race-details/virginia-congressional-district-7/">Virginia&#8217;s 7th Congressional District contest</a>, where Democrat Eugene Vindman is facing off against Republican Derrick Anderson; and V<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/race-details/virginia-congressional-district-2/">irginia&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District race</a>, where Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal is competing against Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>West Virginia: $50,000 for get-out-the-vote and paid mail programs targeting “youth and minority voters” who could affect four competitive state legislative races.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>North Dakota: Nearly $40,000 for get-out-the-vote efforts and organizing in tribal communities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>New Jersey: “Five figures” will go to get-out-the-vote operations in all state races, with a particular focus on Rep. Andy Kim’s U.S. Senate race against Republican Curtis Bashaw. It’s the first DNC spending in the Garden State this cycle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Tennessee: An unspecified amount to help the state party “build on the organizing momentum” it has seen in the past year.</li>

<p>The debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia hosted by ABC News just 56 days before the election was also notable as the first exchange between the candidates since President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8" target="_blank">exited</a> the race weeks after his botched debate performance in late June.</p>

<p>It is the only debate the campaigns have agreed to before the November election, although the Harris camp afterward suggested they’re ready for another and Fox News offered to host it in October.</p>
<p>The night began with Democratic nominee Harris crossing the stage to initiate a handshake and introducing herself to Trump, the GOP candidate. The two had never before met.</p>
<p>But the back-and-forth quickly grew contentious, as Trump blasted Harris’ record as vice president under President Joe Biden, and Harris said Trump was unfit to be president for myriad reasons. The two did not shake hands at the close.</p>
<p>Harris portrayed herself as a champion of the middle class. She presented a hopeful vision of the country that she sought to contrast with what she described as Trump’s self-centered vision that included attacks on the country’s democratic traditions and people of color.</p>
<p>“I am actually the only person on this stage who has a plan that is about lifting up the middle class and working people of America,” she said. “I believe in the ambition, the aspirations, the dreams of the American people.”</p>
<p>The vice president lambasted Trump as “extreme” and sought to tie him to the ultraconservative Project 2025, with which he denied an association. Harris also underscored the numerous legal cases Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trumps-jan-6-case-extend-beyond-election-day-under-timeline-laid-out-judge%C2%A0-2" target="_blank">continues</a> to face. Trump is the first former president to become a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">convicted</a> felon.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump actually has no plan for you,” she said. “Because he is more interested in defending himself than he is in looking out for you.”</p>
<p>Trump repeated unverified claims about migrants eating dogs in Ohio, returned time and again to complaints about immigration, defended his plan to raise tariffs and boasted about campaign rally crowd sizes — after Harris taunted him about his events, saying people left.</p>
<p>“In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs, the people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating, they’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” Trump said in one of the more jarring moments of the debate, when he repeated <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/jd-vance-ohio-police-no-reports-haitian-immigrants-harming-pets-rcna170271" target="_blank">baseless</a> claims about Haitian migrants. The rumors have circulated on social media in recent days, and have been <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GXC9L0aXQAAjeIm.jpeg" target="_blank">amplified</a> by Trump’s running mate, Ohio U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance.</p>
<p>Trump challenged Harris to use her position in the administration to address inflation and immigration, suggesting that she was not actually able to follow through on her promises.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LvYR73wQrF"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/15/im-entitled-to-personal-attacks-against-harris-trump-asserts/"> ‘I’m entitled to personal attacks’ against Harris, Trump asserts</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“She doesn’t have a plan,” he said. “She copied Biden’s plan, and it’s like four sentences like, ‘Run, Spot, run,’ four sentences that are just, ‘Oh, we’ll try and lower taxes.’ She doesn’t have a plan.”</p>
<p>Polls show the race is <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/category/political/nyt/" target="_blank">virtually tied</a> nationally and in seven key states that will decide the Electoral College margin: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. Harris enjoyed a polling bump soon after she became a candidate, but her numbers have dropped in the weeks since and recent polls showed her roughly even with Trump.</p>
<p>Among the top moments of the night touching on policy and politics:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The 2024 presidential election marks a test for the peaceful transfer of power after political violence marred the nation’s tradition when Trump’s refusal to accept his loss sparked a Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump repeated false claims during Tuesday’s debate that he won the 2020 presidential election, even walking back recent public statements that seemed to accept defeat.</p>
<p>Asked by moderator David Muir if recent statements that he “lost by a whisker” and similar sentiments were acknowledgements he’d lost, Trump said the comments were sarcastic.</p>
<p>“I don’t acknowledge that at all,” he said. “That was said sarcastically.”</p>
<p>Harris called Trump’s answer “deeply troubling.”</p>
<p>“You did, in fact, lose that election,” she told him. She added that his continued denial “leads one to believe that perhaps we do not have, in the candidate to my right, the temperament or the ability to not be confused about fact. That’s deeply troubling, and the American people deserve better.</p>
<p>When asked if he regretted any of his actions when the U.S. Capitol was violently overrun by his supporters, Trump defended himself and returned to the topic of immigration.</p>
<p>“I had nothing to do with that, other than they asked me to make a speech,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Harris responded: “For everyone watching who remembers what January 6 was, I say ‘We don’t have to go back.’”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Race</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Moderators asked Trump about his <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2024/07/31/trump-insults-harris-makes-false-claims-quarrels-with-black-journalists-at-conference/" target="_blank">disparaging comments</a> about Harris’ biracial identity to the National Association of Black Journalists last month. Muir questioned if it was appropriate for Trump to weigh in on his opponent’s race.</p>
<p>Trump said it was not appropriate, but seemed to defend the comment that Harris had “turned Black” to promote her political career.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what she is,” he said. “Whatever she wants to be is OK with me. All I can say is that I read where she was not Black, that she put out, and I’ll say that, and then I read that she was Black, and that’s okay. Either one was okay with me. That’s up to her.”</p>
<p>Harris called it “a tragedy” that Trump continued “to use race to divide the American people.”</p>
<p>She invoked allegations that he refused to rent his residential properties to Black families, spread conspiracy theories that the first Black president, Barack Obama, was not born in the United States and supported the execution of Black and Latino boys accused of murder in New York’s Central Park. The suspects were later exonerated.</p>
<p>“The American people want better than that, want better than this,” she said, adding that voters wanted a conversation about how candidates could improve their lives. “Regardless of people’s color or the language their grandmother speaks, we all have the same dreams and aspirations, and want a president who invests in those, not in hate and division.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion and IVF</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The 2024 presidential election is the first since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 6-3 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>While Trump told debate moderators that he would not sign a nationwide abortion bill into law, he refused to give a yes or no answer when asked if he would veto one.</p>
<p>Moderator Linsey Davis corrected Trump after he claimed that some states allow abortion “in the ninth month,” but he continued to repeat it throughout the debate.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qw37QWvj2i"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/">Virginia Democrats do not support infanticide, but here’s why Trump keeps saying they do</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia Democrats do not support infanticide, but here’s why Trump keeps saying they do&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/embed/#?secret=O8snATNWbx#?secret=qw37QWvj2i" data-secret="qw37QWvj2i" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Trump hailed the Supreme Court justices — three of whom he appointed — for giving full control of abortion laws to state governments.</p>
<p>“What I did is something, for 52 years, they have been trying to get Roe v. Wade into the states, and through the genius and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices, we were able to do that,” Trump said, adding that he “strongly” believes in exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.</p>
<p>Harris said she would “proudly” sign a bill into law that restored the federal right to an abortion.</p>
<p>“One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,” Harris said.</p>
<p>She attacked what she dubbed “Donald Trump’s abortion bans” and said his actions resulted in a reality where couples “who pray and dream of having a family are being denied IVF treatments.”</p>
<p>In vitro fertilization, or IVF, has become a <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/02/28/u-s-senate-republican-blocks-legislation-protecting-in-vitro-fertilization/" target="_blank">lightning rod for debate</a> on the right after an Alabama court ruled in early 2024 that frozen embryos counted as children. Legislators in the state have since passed a law to restore IVF access.</p>
<p>Trump said Harris was telling “another lie.”</p>
<p>“I have been a leader on IVF, with which is fertilization, the IVF. I have been a leader,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes, the economy, health care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With Trump’s signature 2017 tax law expiring at the end of 2025, tax policy has been front and center of the 2024 presidential race.</p>
<p>Harris trumpeted her plans for an “opportunity economy” and panned Trump’s proposal to raise tariffs and “provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations.”</p>
<p>“Donald Trump has no plan for you, and when you look at his economic plan, it’s all about tax breaks for the richest people,” Harris said on the debate stage.</p>
<p>Harris’ proposals include increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%, permanently expanding the child tax credit to pandemic levels and extending up to $6,000 to new parents, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-roll-out-new-plan-tax-relief-small-businesses" target="_blank">providing</a> up to $50,000 in tax relief for business start-up costs, and offering new homebuyers a $25,000 tax credit.</p>
<p>A large part of Trump’s economic plan is to impose universal tariffs of at</p>
<p>least 10% on all U.S. imports, with tariffs on Chinese goods at 60%. When asked by Muir if the approach could cause consumer prices to increase, Trump denied the possibility.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to have higher prices. What’s going to happen, who’s going to have higher prices is China, and all of the countries that have been ripping us off for years,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Trump has promised, at minimum, to extend his tax policies, which cut individual income tax rates, lowered the corporate tax rate to 21%, loosened business expensing and deductions, and doubled the child tax credit to $2,000.</p>
<p>Economists warn that if extended, the Trump-era tax cuts would add trillions to the deficit. That total could reach between $4 trillion and $5.8 trillion over the next decade, <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">according</a> to the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model. In a separate model, the Tax Foundation <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/donald-trump-tax-plan-2024/" target="_blank">estimated</a> the policies could reduce federal revenue up to $6.1 trillion over a 10-year window.</p>
<p>The Penn Wharton model <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/harris-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">estimates</a> Harris’ proposals would increase the deficit by up to $2 trillion over ten years. Modeling from the Tax Foundation released Tuesday <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/kamala-harris-tax-plan-2024/" target="_blank">predicts</a> the vice president’s plan would increase taxes by $4.1 trillion over the next decade, but after accounting for various tax cuts and credits, the projected revenue drops to $1.7 trillion, and even further if slowed economic growth is considered.</p>
<p>On health care, Trump said he had “concepts of a plan” to overhaul the law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.</p>
<p>“I would only change it if we come up with something that’s better and less expensive,” he said. “And there are concepts and options we have to do that, and you’ll be hearing about it in the not too distant future.”</p>
<p>Harris defended the law known as “Obamacare.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration and border security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump tried several times to steer the conversation to immigration, his signature issue since he began his first White House run in 2015.</p>
<p>He referenced viral — but unverified — stories of sensational disruptions caused by immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado, and blamed Harris and Biden for the supposed episodes.</p>
<p>“These are the people that she and Biden let into our country,” he said.</p>
<p>Continuing Biden’s immigration policies would turn the country into “Venezuela on steroids,” he said.</p>
<p>Harris laughed after Trump pressed unverified claims about immigration. “Talk about extreme,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris promoted a bipartisan immigration and border security bill this year that included measures Republicans sought to strengthen enforcement. But the bill fell apart, she said, under opposition from Trump, who preferred campaigning on the issue to solving the problem.</p>
<p>When moderators then asked Trump about the bill, he began his answer by bragging about crowds at his campaign rallies, responding to a comment Harris had made.</p>
<p>Rally attendance remained high, he said, “because people want to take their country back.”</p>
<p>“Our country is being lost,” he said. “We’re a failing nation, and it happened three-and-a-half years ago. And what? What’s going on here? … What they have done to our country by allowing these millions and millions of people to come into our country and look at what’s happening to the towns all over the United States.”</p>
<p>He did not answer the question about the bill.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy and climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Moderators asked Harris about her position on hydraulic fracturing, a technique for extracting natural gas better known as fracking.</p>
<p>The process is controversial among environmentalists, but a major industry in gas-rich Pennsylvania. During her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020, Harris told a climate activist during a televised town hall that she favored banning fracking, but has said this year that is not her position.</p>
<p>Asked by Davis to explain the change Tuesday night, she said she’s also made clear in 2020 that she did not want to ban fracking.</p>
<p>She also noted her tie-breaking vote in the Senate to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, a massive energy, taxes and domestic policy law Democrats passed along party lines in 2022 that included expanded leases for natural gas production.</p>
<p>Trump urged voters not to believe Harris.</p>
<p>“If she becomes president, fracking in Pennsylvania will end on day one,” he said.</p>
<p>The last question before closing statements was on climate change.</p>
<p>Harris called it a threat and touted the Biden administration’s work to expand the clean energy industry, while preserving natural gas jobs.</p>
<p>Trump declined to answer the question, instead focusing on the work of Hunter Biden, the president’s son, with a Ukrainian energy company. Trump called the Biden administration “corrupt.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As the humanitarian crisis continues in the Gaza Strip with deaths mounting 40,000, according to Gaza health officials, Davis asked Harris how she could break through a stalemate on a proposed cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas militants.</p>
<p>The vice president offered little detail on how to finally broker a deal, but said, “What we know is this war must end.”</p>
<p>“It must end immediately, and the way it will end is we need a cease-fire deal, and we need the hostages out, and so we will continue to work around the clock on that — work around the clock — also understanding that we must chart a course for a two-state solution,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris added that she will “always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran.”</p>
<p>Trump lashed back with accusations that Harris “hates” Israel and the “Arab population,” and repeated his refrain that “if I were president, (the war) would have never started.”</p>
<p>“I will get that settled and fast, and I’ll get the war with Ukraine and Russia ended. If I’m president-elect, I’ll get it done before even becoming president,” Trump said.</p>
<p>He did not directly answer if he wanted Ukraine to win the war.</p>
<p>“I think it’s in the U.S. best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal, because we have to stop all of these human lives from being destroyed,” Trump said when asked if a Ukraine victory is in the U.S.’s best interest.</p>
<p>Harris said she would continue to stand with NATO allies on defending Ukraine.</p>
<p>“I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up. And that’s not who we are as Americans,” she rebutted.</p>
<p>Another foreign policy topic was on display at the U.S. Capitol hours before the debate when congressional leaders held a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?537990-1/house-speaker-mike-johnson-holds-congressional-medal-ceremony" target="_blank">ceremony</a> honoring 13 service members who were killed during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Trump and Republican lawmakers have ratcheted up criticism of Harris — implicating her hundreds of times in a damning <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WILLFULL-BLINDNESS-An-Assessment-of-the-Biden-Harris%20Administrations-Withdrawal-from-Afghanistan-and-the-Chaos-that-Followed.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released Monday — for the Biden administration’s handling of the August 2021 exit from Afghanistan after two decades of war.</p>
<p>“I will tell you I agreed with President Biden’s decision to pull out of Afghanistan. Four presidents said they would, and Joe Biden did,” Harris told Muir when asked if she bears any responsibility for the deadly withdrawal.</p>
<p>Harris criticized Trump for “negotiating directly with a terrorist organization” when he struck a deal with the Taliban before he left office.</p>
<p>Trump defended himself saying “I got involved with the Taliban because the Taliban was doing the killing” and said he achieved a “very good agreement.”</p>
<p>Trump made waves on the recent third anniversary of the 13 service members’ deaths when his staffers pushed an Arlington National Cemetery official aside to take photos in a restricted area, according to the U.S. Army and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5091154/trump-arlington-cemetery" target="_blank">reporting</a> by NPR.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Swift endorsement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after the debate’s close, mega star Taylor Swift said in an Instagram post she would vote for Harris.</p>
<p>Part of Swift’s exuberant fan base had called on her to endorse Harris, following her support for Biden and Harris four years ago.</p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>CHICAGO — Vice President Kamala Harris accepted her party’s nomination for president Thursday evening, pitching her candidacy as an opportunity for the nation to move forward, rather than accept a dark future she said would follow a second election of her Republican opponent.</p>
<p>Harris on the last night of the Democratic National Convention took advantage of the largest television audience she’s likely to have at least until her first debate with Republican nominee Donald Trump next month.</p>
<p>The vice president told her life story to the millions of Americans watching, saying it informed her agenda meant to boost the country’s’ middle class.</p>
<p>She characterized herself as a lifelong public servant and unifier, in contrast to what she described as Trump’s divisive self-centeredness.</p>
<p>“My entire career, I have only had one client: the people,” she said. “And so, on behalf of the people, on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender, or the language your grandmother speaks, on behalf of my mother and everyone who has ever set out  on their own unlikely journey, … on behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination for president of the United States of America.”</p>
<p>She professed her patriotism several times in her roughly 40-minute address. Near the close, she urged the Democrats in the arena and viewers at home to work for her election on behalf of the country.</p>
<p>“Let’s get out there and let’s fight for it,” she said “Let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told.”</p>
<p>Americans across the nation made their assessments. Yvette Young, a lifelong Philadelphia resident and project manager at SEPTA who attended a watch party at a Harris campaign office, said she thought it was an excellent speech and comprehensive.</p>
<p>“She touched on, I think, every issue,” Young said. “She wasn’t afraid to call Donald Trump out on his nonsense and put into perspective how he has harmed our country.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A middle-class childhood</h4>

	
<p>Harris has downplayed the historic nature of her candidacy — she is the first Black and South Asian woman to lead a major party ticket and would be the first woman president of any race — but expanded Thursday on the values her immigrant mother instilled in her.</p>
<p>Her mother, a scientist from India, “was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for women’s health,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris described her upbringing as middle class, saying she was raised mainly by her mom after her parents divorced. Harris’ father was a Jamaican student who met her mother at a civil rights meeting, Harris said Thursday.</p>
<p>The vice president promised to be a middle-class champion, creating what she called “an opportunity economy” that would unite labor, small businesses and workers. Additionally, she pledged to “end America’s housing shortage,” to lower the cost of everyday needs.</p>
<p>Ahead of the convention, Harris<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-unveils-plan-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes" target="_blank"> unveiled policy details</a> to stop price gouging, boost the child tax credit, curb rent hikes and help first-time homebuyers.</p>
<p>“We know a strong middle class has always been critical to America’s success,” she said. “And building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. This is personal to me. The middle class is where I come from.”</p>
<p>Her remarks were applauded by another person at the watch party, Lindsay Davis, a Germantown resident and UX designer.</p>
<p>Davis believes that there’s a particular issue that Harris can talk about that can sway undecided voters.</p>
<p>“A lot of the stuff she’s already said about making it easier for first-time homebuyers to buy a house that was, like, huge,” she said. “I think that’s really big for, like, younger people that aren’t boomers, I guess Gen Z, Gen X, Gen whatever, all the Gens.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A sense of justice</h4>

	
<p>Harris’s mother also taught her daughters “never to complain about injustice, but to do something about it,” she said, repeating a line former first lady Michelle Obama used throughout a Tuesday speech.</p>
<p>She said the same sense of justice motivated her to become a prosecutor, which she did as the district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California before her election to the U.S. Senate in 2016.</p>
<p>As the top lawyer in California, Harris won a $20 billion settlement for homeowners in the state as part of a nationwide lawsuit against banks over predatory lending during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who was also his state’s attorney general at the time, said Thursday in remarks just before Harris spoke that he saw her demand much more than what the banks initially offered.</p>
<p>“America, we’ve got a lot of big fights ahead of us,” he said. “And we’ve got one hell of a fighter ready to take them on.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s ‘dark agenda’</h4>

	
<p>Harris described much of her policy objectives in contrast to her opponent, the former president seeking another term, Trump.</p>
<p>While her administration would work to expand reproductive rights, Trump would further restrict them, she said.</p>
<p>Trump would pursue a nationwide abortion ban “with or without Congress,” limit access to birth control and require women to report miscarriages, she said.</p>
<p>“Why is it that they don’t trust women?” she asked the packed United Center crowd. “Well, we trust women.”</p>
<p>She said if she is elected, and Congress passes a bill restoring the Roe v. Wade abortion decision, she will sign it into law. For that to happen, Democrats would likely need to not only control both chambers, but also have 60 votes in the Senate.</p>
<p>On foreign policy, Harris said Trump wouldn’t stand up to dictators, “because he wants to be an autocrat himself.”</p>
<p>She described November’s election as a “fight for America’s future.”</p>
<p>The crowd broke out in a chant: “We’re not going back.”</p>
<p>She also asked the audience to imagine how dangerous Trump would be in office after a July 1 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said Trump could not be prosecuted for most actions he took in office.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Second woman candidate</h4>

	
<p>Harris addressed a packed crowd in which many women wore white, a nod to the women’s suffrage movement.</p>
<p>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who gave a speech Monday, was the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major party at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, when she gave her acceptance speech in a white pantsuit.</p>
<p>But Harris dressed head to toe in black.</p>
<p>She took the stage to Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” a song the campaign has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/black-women-quickly-mobilize-boost-kamala-harris-presidential-bid" target="_blank">made its anthem.</a> Beyoncé, however, did not appear in person, despite widespread rumors she would show up.</p>
<p>After Harris’ speech, what Democratic officials said were 100,000 red, white and blue balloons were released, a convention tradition. Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and his wife, Gwen Walz, held hands onstage and acknowledged the cheers of the delegates.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Unexpected’ path to nomination</h4>

	
<p>Harris acknowledged her abbreviated path to the nomination, which began just 32 days ago, was highly unusual.</p>
<p>After President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid and endorsed Harris on July 21, the party quickly coalesced around the vice president.</p>
<p>She racked up the necessary delegates and after a short vetting period tapped Walz. They soon hit the campaign trail in the seven key battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Throughout the whirlwind, she has praised Biden for his leadership and accomplishments.</p>
<p>She did again in the opening lines of her speech Thursday.</p>
<p>“Your record is extraordinary, as history will show,” she said. “And your character is inspiring.”</p>
<p>Republicans have criticized the process that led to Harris’ nomination, calling it a “coup” against Biden.</p>
<p>In a written statement ahead of Harris’ address Thursday, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley repeated that claim and slammed Harris’ policy proposals as “the most radical agenda ever put forward at a major party convention.”</p>
<p>“After staging a coup to take the nomination from Joe Biden just weeks ago, Kamala Harris will take the stage at the DNC to share her dangerously liberal agenda with the Democrats gathered to coronate her in Chicago,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Convention capstone</h4>

	
<p>Harris’ acceptance marked the end of a four-day convention focused on the theme of passing the torch to the next generation that was woven through the speeches of long-established Democrats in the party, such as former President Bill Clinton, who said he <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/bill-clinton-urges-democrats-work-harris-president-joy" target="_blank">loved “seeing all these young leaders.”</a></p>
<p>On the first night, Biden, who dropped out of the race last month, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-delivers-late-night-farewell-democrats-he-passes-torch-harris" target="_blank">delivered a farewell address to Democrats</a>, endorsing Harris. The Obamas Tuesday made the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/hope-making-comeback-obamas-make-case-kamala-harris" target="_blank">case for Harris,</a> saying in her candidacy, “hope is making a comeback.”</p>
<p>As Harris gave her speech aimed at defining her candidacy and vision for the country as one of freedom and joy, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/frustrated-uncommitted-delegates-push-palestinian-american-speaker-dnc-nears-end" target="_blank">a sit-in protest occurred outside the United Center.</a> Dozens of Uncommitted delegates who advocated for a Palestinian American to have a speaking slot at the DNC said they had their request denied by the Harris campaign.</p>
<p>Inside the arena, Harris said negotiating an end to the war, with a return of Israeli hostages and a lasting cease-fire, was a top administration priority.</p>
<p>“President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity,” she said.</p>
<p>At the watch party in Philadelphia, Alina Taylor, a special education teacher who lives in Upper Dublin, said as a Democratic committee person for her area, she plans to volunteer and canvass for the Harris campaign.</p>
<p>“I came down here because I’m fired up and I’m ready to go,” she said.</p>
<p>She said prior to Harris’ speech that she wants to hear her talk about the economy and what she plans on doing about reproductive rights.</p>
<p>“That’s so huge, because I want my daughters to have more rights than me, and I don’t want them to have less,” she said.</p>

</p><p>CHICAGO — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted the Democratic nomination for vice president Wednesday, showcasing his appeal on the third night of the Democratic National Convention as a candidate who can fuse a middle-class image to a fairly progressive record and effectively attack the Republican alternative.</p>
<p>A native of a small town in Nebraska, Walz is a former high school teacher, coach and Army National Guardsman whom presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris chose just a little more than two weeks ago as her running mate.</p>
<p>In his speech to delegates packed into the United Center, an introduction to millions of Americans, Walz made the case that Democrats’ policies were the ones more consistent with heartland values than those of Republicans, led by the presidential ticket of former President Donald Trump and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance.</p>
<p>“This is a big part about what this election is about: freedom,” he said.</p>
<p>Republicans invoke freedom to pass restrictions on reproductive rights, allow corporations to pollute and permit banks to take advantage of customers, he said.</p>
<p>“But when we Democrats talk about freedom, we mean the freedom to make a better life for yourself and the people that you love, to make your own health care decisions, your kids to go to school without worrying about being shot dead,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Coach Walz</h4>

	
<p>A night after former President Barack Obama attested to Walz’s authentic style by lightly mocking his worn flannel shirts, other speakers sought to brandish Walz’s image as a stereotypically sensible Upper Midwesterner.</p>
<p>Minnesota’s senior Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Benjamin Ingman, a former student and next-door neighbor of Walz’s, introduced the vice-presidential candidate.</p>
<p>“Tim Walz is the kind of the guy you can count on to push you out of a snowbank,” Ingman said, referring to the neighborly chore of freeing a vehicle stuck after a heavy snow. “I know this because Tim Walz pushed me out of a snowbank.”</p>
<p>While Ingman spoke, former members of Walz-coached football teams took the stage, wearing red-and-white Mankato West High School football jerseys.</p>
<p>Klobuchar praised Walz’s progressive policy wins as governor — signing laws to guarantee paid leave, provide school meals and cut taxes for families.</p>
<p>She also made note of Walz’s folksy appeal and humble background that is unusual at the highest levels of U.S. politics.</p>
<p>“A former football coach knows how to level the playing field,” Klobuchar said. “And a former public school teacher knows how to school the likes of J.D. Vance.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Freedom theme</h4>

	
<p>Walz argued that Democrats sought to expand freedom, a central theme of the Harris campaign, while Republicans worked to limit rights.</p>
<p>He mentioned fertility treatments, which he and his wife, Gwen, used to conceive their two children. After the U.S. Supreme Court repealed the nationwide right to an abortion, some Republicans have also opposed in vitro fertilization, a common fertility treatment. Gwen Walz clarified this week that the Walzes used a different fertility treatment that is not as controversial with anti-abortion advocates.</p>
<p>Still, Walz said the pain of infertility was “hell,” and in an emotional moment, he acknowledged Gwen and children Hope and Gus in the crowd, telling them they were his “entire world.”</p>
<p>The crowd cheered as the Walz family’s emotion-filled faces appeared on the screens in the United Center.</p>
<p>Walz promoted his record as governor, including the free school meals program and an expansion of reproductive rights, and framed them as in line with traditional American values.</p>
<p>“While other states were banning books from their schools, we were banishing hunger from ours,” he said. “We also protected reproductive freedom because in Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and the choices they make. Even if we wouldn’t make those same choices for ourselves, we’ve got a golden rule: Mind your own damn business.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Project 2025</h4>

	
<p>Walz blasted the Republican agenda, including the 900-plus page proposal published by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>Republicans, including the Trump campaign, have sought to distance themselves from the document, which includes several provisions that Democrats have been eager to criticize.</p>
<p>Walz said it showed Republicans would gut Social Security and Medicare, repeal the popular health care law known as Obamacare and restrict abortion nationwide.</p>
<p>He characterized Republicans as out of touch, extreme and — and he has for weeks — weird.</p>
<p>“It’s an agenda that served nobody except the richest and the most extreme amongst us, and it’s an agenda that does nothing for our neighbors in need,” he said. “Is it weird? Absolutely.”</p>
<p>Walz sought to position Democrats as the party of common sense, including on guns.</p>
<p>As a veteran and hunter, Walz was familiar with guns and supportive of gun rights. But he suggested there must be limits that many Republicans do not accept.</p>
<p>“I believe in the Second Amendment,” he said. “But I also believe our first responsibility is to keep our kids safe.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Call to action</h4>

	
<p>As president, he said, Harris would lower middle-class taxes, rein in drug costs and “stand up and fight for your freedom to live the life that you want to lead.”</p>
<p>Using another mainstay of his campaign speeches, Walz urged the Democratic delegates in the audience to work tirelessly until Election Day.</p>
<p>Walz’s acceptance pumped up the group of Democratic delegates from Minnesota, who stayed for roughly 30 minutes after the program ended on the United Center floor chanting “U-S-A,” “Harris-Walz,” “Minnesota” and other cheers.</p>
<p>In another ode to his state, musicians John Legend and Sheila E. performed “Let’s Go Crazy” by Minnesota native Prince before Walz took the stage.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Oprah endorsement</h4>

	
<p>Just before the odes to Walz began, TV talk show legend Oprah Winfrey, whose show was broadcast from Chicago for decades, made a surprise appearance on the convention stage.</p>
<p>Winfrey made the case for Harris as a barrier-breaking candidate and a deeply decent person.</p>
<p>Winfrey, who has backed every Democratic presidential candidate since Obama in 2008 but said she remains an independent voter, urged undecided voters to base their votes on the candidates’ character.</p>
<p>“Decency and respect are on the ballot in 2024,” she said. “And just plain common sense. Common sense tells you that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can give us decency and respect.”</p>
<p>She criticized Republicans under Trump.</p>
<p>“Let us choose loyalty to the Constitution instead of loyalty to a single person,” she said</p>
<p>She appealed for an inclusive vision of politics, rejecting Vance’s dismissive description of some Democratic voters as “childless cat ladies.”</p>
<p>“Despite what some would have you think, we are not so different from our neighbors,” she said. “When a house is on fire, we don’t ask about the homeowner’s race or religion. We don’t wonder who their partner is or how they voted, no. We just try to do the best we can to save them. And if the place happens to belong to a childless cat lady, well, we try to get that cat out too.”</p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p>CHICAGO — As he did in his first speech to a Democratic National Convention 20 years ago, former President Barack Obama emphasized the connections binding Americans together and called for a more positive national atmosphere on the second night of this year’s convention Tuesday, while rallying Democrats to campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>At the United Center, in a convention hosted by their hometown, Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, who spoke immediately before the former president, scattered references to the 2008 and 2012 White House races he won as they made the case for Harris.</p>
<p>“America, hope is making a comeback,” Michelle Obama said, referring to the theme of her husband’s 2008 campaign and tying it to Harris.</p>
<p>The energy among the Democrats since Harris became a presidential candidate a month ago could be described as “the contagious power of hope,” she said.</p>
<p>The couple also trained criticism on Republican nominee former President Donald Trump, painting him as an agent of division and calling for voters to reject him in favor of a more inclusive nation.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them,” Barack Obama said. “Between the real Americans, who of course support him, and the outsiders who don’t.”</p>
<p>He called for Americans to turn aside that point of view.</p>
<p>Republicans in their response also sought to tie Harris to Obama.</p>
<p>“Democrats want to evoke memories of 2008,” Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley said in a written statement. “But this isn’t Barack Obama’s Democrat Party — Kamala Harris is even more dangerously liberal.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Michelle Obama’s change in tone</h4>

	
<p>In a marked shift from her convention speeches eight and four years ago, when she encouraged Democrats to take the moral high road in response to Trump’s attacks, Michelle Obama took a much more confrontational tone Tuesday night toward the Republican nominee.</p>
<p>“Who’s gonna tell him the job he is currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs?” she said, in reference to a comment Trump had made about immigrants taking “Black jobs.”</p>
<p>Harris would be the second Black president, after Obama.</p>
<p>Earlier, with veiled shots at Trump, the former first lady contrasted him with Harris.</p>
<p>Harris “understands that most of us will never be afforded the grace of failing forward,” she said. “Who will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth. If we bankrupt a business or choke in a crisis, we don’t get a second, third or fourth chance.”</p>
<p>Some Republicans have called Harris, a Black and South Asian woman, a “DEI hire,” an implication that her race and gender were more important than her career and character qualifications. Trump gained an inheritance from his father, who was also a real estate developer.</p>
<p>Trump oversaw bankrupted businesses before he entered politics. And Democrats have said he bungled the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Barack Obama also leveled attacks on Trump, calling him “a 78-year-old billionaire who has not stopped whining about his problems since he came down off his golden escalator” when he announced his 2016 presidential bid.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump alternative</h4>

	
<p>Both Obamas said Harris provided a strong alternative to Trump.</p>
<p>Not born into privilege like Trump, she has the empathy he lacks, Barack Obama said.</p>
<p>“In other words, Kamala Harris won’t be focused on her problems,” he said. “She’ll be focused on yours.”</p>
<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, also provided a counterbalance to Trump, Obama said, adding that he loved Walz’s authentic Midwestern persona.</p>
<p>Both Obamas called on Democrats to work hard for Harris’ cause over the 11 weeks until Election Day.</p>
<p>Michelle Obama made “do something” a refrain of her speech.</p>
<p>“You know what we need to do,” the former first lady said. “Michelle Obama is asking you — no I’m telling y’all — to do something. This election is going to be close. In some states, just a handful of votes in every precinct could decide the winner.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden tribute</h4>

	
<p>Barack Obama dedicated the first portion of his roughly half-hour speech to honoring his vice president, President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Biden guided the country out of the COVID-19 pandemic and led a strong economic recovery while lowering health care costs, Obama said.</p>
<p>And Biden deserved credit for sacrificing his political ambition by bowing out of his reelection race, he said.</p>
<p>“At a time when the other party had turned into a cult of personality, we needed a leader who was steady, and brought people together and was selfless enough to do the rarest thing there is in politics: putting his own ambition aside for the sake of the country,” Obama said. “History will remember Joe Biden as a president who defended democracy at a time of great danger.”</p>
<p>He nodded along as the crowd chanted “Thank you, Joe.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Appealing to unity</h4>

	
<p>Both Obamas repeated slogans from campaigns that had his name on the ballot and his presidency, seeking to tie his historic election victory to Harris’ campaign.</p>
<p>“On health care, we should all be proud of the progress we made through the Affordable Care Act,” Barack Obama said, referring to the major health care law he championed in his first term. “I noticed, by the way, that since it became popular they don’t call it Obamacare no more.”</p>
<p>Harris “knows we can’t stop there,” he continued, and would work to lower drug costs.</p>
<p>He also called for Americans to focus on common bonds.</p>
<p>“The ties that bind us together are still there,” he said. “We still coach Little League and look out for our elderly neighbors. We still feed the hungry in churches and mosques and synagogues and temples.”</p>
<p>In his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, Obama also invoked Little League to stress national unity.</p>
<p>“The vast majority of us do not want to live in a country this bitter and divided,” he said Tuesday. “We want something better. We want to be better.”</p>
<p>The excitement for the Harris campaign showed that was a popular idea, he added.</p>
<p>To close his speech, he invoked the first president nominated at a Chicago convention, elected in the most bitterly divided period of American history — Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>“As much as any policy or program, I believe that’s what we yearn for: A return to an America where we work together and look out for each other, a restoration of what Lincoln called, on the eve of civil war, ‘our bonds of affection,’ when America taps what he called ‘the better angels of our nature,’” he said. “That’s what this election is all about.”</p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>CHICAGO –– After waiting nearly an hour to deliver a scheduled-for-prime-time speech that was pushed to nearly 11:30 p.m. Eastern time, President Joe Biden waited an extra three minutes at the lectern on the first night of the Democratic National Convention as chants from party faithful drowned out his attempts to begin.</p>
<p>When planning for the convention began, Biden was expected to speak, as the party’s nominee, on the final night.</p>
<p>Instead, he spoke Monday as a leader a few months away from retirement, and as a bridge to new Democratic leadership.</p>
<p>“I love my job,” he said as he approached the end of his remarks. “But I love my country more.”</p>
<p>In the final minutes of perhaps the final major political speech in a half-century-long career, Biden quoted a song by Gene Scheer.</p>
<p>“America, America, I gave my best to you,” he said.</p>
<p>Early and often as he spoke, the thousands of Democratic delegates at the United Center voiced their appreciation, delaying and interrupting him with chants of “We love Joe.”</p>
<p>Hours after another crowd, protesters opposed to Biden’s handling of Israel’s war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, gathered outside the convention hall, Biden gave his strongest remarks to date on the conflict, calling for a cease-fire. He conceded the protesters “have a point.”</p>
<p>Biden’s address provided a glimpse of what an acceptance speech for a second Democratic nomination might have looked like. But instead of promising what he would do in a second term, he said Vice President Kamala Harris would continue the administration’s work.</p>
<p>Biden endorsed Harris as his replacement on the Democratic ticket when he withdrew from the race last month under pressure from Democratic leaders, following his debate performance in June.</p>
<p>In a moment that seemed to surprise Biden, Harris and second spouse Doug Emhoff joined the president and first lady on stage directly after the speech.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘The best volunteer’</h4>

	
<p>Throughout the address, Biden promoted his own record and said Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, possessed the same values and character that would lead to policies Democrats want.</p>
<p>“I promise I’ll be the best volunteer the Harris and Walz campaign has ever seen,” he said.</p>
<p>Much of his remarks were also focused on the Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump, whom Biden defeated in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Biden’s appearance was bumped out of the prime-time block, as scores of earlier speakers and performers forced Democrats’ debut night further and further off schedule. Some had to be rescheduled.</p>
<p>“Because of the raucous applause interrupting speaker after speaker, we ultimately skipped elements of our program to ensure we could get to President Biden as quickly as possible so that he could speak directly to the American people,” convention officials said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We are proud of the electric atmosphere in our convention hall and proud that our convention is showcasing the broad and diverse coalition behind the Harris-Walz ticket throughout the week on and off the stage.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Infrastructure, gun safety, prescription drugs</h4>

	
<p>Biden promoted his record over nearly four years in office. The country was no longer in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, he said.</p>
<p>He said wages were trending up and inflation was moving down, though he noted there was still more to do on those issues.</p>
<p>He delivered a massive infrastructure bill, signed a bipartisan gun safety law and worked to bring costs of prescription drugs down.</p>
<p>Promoting the successes of his administration, Biden highlighted Harris’ role.</p>
<p>When he mentioned the passage of a major Democratic bill in 2022 to boost clean energy production, cap some prescription drug costs and other measures, the crowd responded with a chant of “Thank you, Joe.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Kamala, too,” Biden replied.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Middle East</h4>

	
<p>Biden also said he had much still to do and addressed an issue that has divided Democrats during the past year of his presidency: Israel’s war in Gaza.</p>
<p>He said his administration was working to get humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>
<p>“And finally, finally, finally deliver a cease-fire and end this war,” he said, pounding the lectern with his fist. “Those protesters out in the street, they have a point. A lot of innocent people are getting killed on both sides.”</p>
<p>On other issues, he said Harris and Walz would continue his work.</p>
<p>“Kamala and Tim will make the child tax cut permanent,” he said, referring to a COVID 19-era provision that increased a tax credit for families.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Contrast with Trump</h4>

	
<p>Biden called Trump a tool of authoritarian leaders, such as Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Biden repeated a story he told throughout the 2020 campaign that he decided to run for president and challenge Trump’s reelection after Trump excused a deadly rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>
<p>Biden rejected political violence and professed a commitment to enduring democracy, a theme he sounded in his 2020 campaign that only gained more relevance after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters who sought to keep him in the White House.</p>
<p>Trump has again not said he would accept the results of an election loss, Biden said.</p>
<p>Electing Harris was a necessary step in protecting democracy, he said.</p>
<p>“Democracy has prevailed, democracy has delivered,” he said. “And now, democracy must be preserved.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Union message</h4>

	
<p>As he has through much of his half-century in national politics, Biden appealed to union members, a traditional Democratic constituency.</p>
<p>“Wall Street didn’t build America,” he said. “The middle class built America, and unions built the middle class.”</p>
<p>He said he was proud to have walked the picket line with striking member of the United Auto Workers.</p>
<p>Earlier in the evening, UAW President Shawn Fain in remarks to the crowd praised Biden for making history as the first president to walk a picket line.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Passing the torch</h4>

	
<p>Speakers throughout the evening praised Biden for his record in office and for passing the torch to Harris.</p>
<p>Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, a Biden ally who took Biden’s seat in the Senate after Biden was elected vice president, said Biden helped the nation recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Jan. 6 attack.</p>
<p>“On behalf of our nation, Joe, for your courage in fighting for our democracy, we thank you,” Coons said. “On behalf of our Democratic Party, for fighting for our Democratic values, we thank you.”</p>
<p>First lady Jill Biden said the president worked for causes larger than himself, which she was reminded of as she saw him “dig deep into his soul and decide to no longer seek reelection and endorse Kamala Harris.”</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking Democrat in the House for years, also praised Biden’s decision to make Harris his running mate, and to endorse her when he dropped out.</p>
<p>Talking to reporters after his official remarks, Clyburn said a Harris victory in November would bookend Biden’s role in Black presidential history. After serving eight years as vice president to the first Black president, Clyburn said, Biden chose the first Black vice president, Harris.</p>
<p>If Harris wins the November election, Clyburn said, “Joe Biden goes down in history as probably the most transformational president this country’s ever had.”</p>

The DNC runs from August 19-22. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p>Democrats will gather in Chicago for their once-every-four-years convention, beginning Monday. Here’s a rundown:</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is it?</h4>

	
<p>National political conventions are large gatherings of party officeholders, candidates and allies. They meet every four years to officially nominate candidates for president and vice president; to adopt a party platform, the list of policy proposals most party members agree on; and to celebrate and network.</p>
<p>This year, Vice President Kamala Harris has already been officially nominated through a virtual roll call vote earlier this month. A ceremonial roll call is still expected to be a part of the convention, and Harris will officially accept the nomination.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">When should I tune in?</h4>

	
<p>The convention runs from Monday, Aug. 19 to Thursday, Aug. 22.</p>
<p>Major news networks and a host of streaming platforms will broadcast the nightly events — usually speeches from high-profile members of the party — live. The prime-time program runs from 6:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday and 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Full schedules for prime-time speeches have not been disclosed, but the vice presidential candidate usually accepts the nomination on Wednesday night and the presidential nominee’s acceptance speech closes out the convention on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Former presidents and presidential nominees are also likely to have speaking roles.</p>
<p>During the day, delegates and party officials will hold various events and meetings, only some of which will be broadcast or even open to reporters, as the convention doubles as a huge networking event for Democratic politicians, strategists, activists and others.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How can I watch?</h4>

	
<p>Network and cable news TV stations generally air the prime-time programming from start to finish.</p>
<p>National Public Radio will also broadcast much of the convention.</p>
<p>Convention organizers will also be livestreaming the event on a host of platforms, including YouTube, X and TikTok. A full list of official livestreams is available <a href="https://demconvention.com/news/press-releases/how-to-watchdemocratic-national-convention-announces-streaming-partners-and-first-ever-vertical-streaming-platforms/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Where is the convention this year?</h4>

	
<p>Chicago is hosting the Democratic convention for the 12th time, the most of any city.</p>
<p>The major addresses in the evening will be at the United Center, an arena that fits tens of thousands for the city’s professional basketball and hockey teams, concerts or other events.</p>
<p>Daytime activities will be more spread out, with locations at McCormick Place, about 6 miles southeast of the United Center, and the River North neighborhood, about 2 ½ miles to the northeast.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How many people will be there?</h4>

	
<p>About 5,000 Democratic delegates, who have the formal duty of voting to approve the nominees for president and vice president, are expected to attend.</p>
<p>A total of about 50,000 people could be in town for the event, according to <a href="https://chicago2024.com/faqs/" target="_blank">the city</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will any celebrities be there? </h4>

	
<p>The 2016 Democratic National Convention — the last in-person convention Democrats held, since they moved the 2020 version online in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic — that nominated Hillary Clinton featured celebrities including singer Katy Perry and screenwriter/actor Lena Dunham.</p>
<p>The Republican National Convention in July included appearances by musical artist Kid Rock and professional wrestler Hulk Hogan during prime time.</p>
<p>A full list of participants for the Democratic convention this year has not yet been shared, but that has not stopped some fans of major music acts from <a href="https://sign.moveon.org/petitions/taylor-swift-and-beyonce-to-perform-together-at-the-dnc-convention-and-formally-support-harris" target="_blank">wishing</a> they’ll see their favorites at the event.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Where can I find fair, fearless and free reporting about the convention?</h4>

	
<p><a href="http://newsfromthestates.com" target="_blank">Right here!</a> And from your state’s newsroom, which you can find on <a href="https://statesnewsroom.com/newsrooms/" data-type="link" data-id="https://statesnewsroom.com/newsrooms/" target="_blank">this map. </a>States Newsroom is sending multiple reporters to cover the convention and will have in-depth coverage of the major events and more.</p>

The convention will be held Aug. 19-22. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Just a little over a month after she became a candidate for president in the biggest shakeup in generations of presidential politics, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday will deliver a widely anticipated speech accepting the Democratic nomination at the party’s convention in Chicago.</p>
<p>Harris’ ascent to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden changed course and said he would not seek reelection has breathed new life into the Democratic bid, with polls showing Harris — who is already <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kamala-harris-will-be-democratic-presidential-nominee-dnc-announces" target="_blank">the party’s official nominee</a> after a virtual roll call earlier this month — faring much better than Biden was against Republican rival Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Over the course of four days, Democrats will look to capitalize on their base’s newfound enthusiasm for the campaign, with leading speakers aiming to rally the faithful around the party’s positions on reproductive rights, gun safety and voting rights, while <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-ballot-democrats-work-build-momentum-bigger-youth-vote" target="_blank">making a strong pitch to young voters</a>. Harris will also be expected to further lay out her policy positions.</p>
<p>Harris’ nomination is historic. The daughter of immigrants, Harris is the first Black and South Asian woman selected to lead a major party ticket. She would be the first woman of any race to guide the nation as chief executive.</p>
<p>The party has not released an official detailed schedule of speakers, but a convention official confirmed that “current and past presidents are expected to participate in convention programming.” Biden and two former presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, as well as former nominee Hillary Clinton, will all speak, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/us/politics/dnc-speakers-biden-obama-clinton.html" target="_blank">according to the New York Times.</a></p>
<p>Vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is expected to address the convention Wednesday evening, with Harris’ acceptance speech closing out the convention Thursday, the convention official said.</p>
<p>The evening programming block will run from 6:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Monday and 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. the rest of the week.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual television broadcasts, the convention will livestream on several social media platforms, including YouTube, X, Instagram and TikTok. The official live stream will be available on <a href="https://demconvention.us9.list-manage.com/track/click?u=d68a84b1a4b0303a9452770cd&amp;id=e86e03e670&amp;e=a21b6b7198" target="_blank">DemConvention.com</a>.</p>
<p>Scores of Democratic caucus and council meetings, as well as state delegation breakfasts and gatherings, are also scheduled throughout the week’s daytime hours. Media organizations and outside groups are also holding daytime events that will feature Democratic officeholders and candidates.</p>
<p>Protests are also expected over the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, with the backdrop of a <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/04/08/israel-hamas-war-sets-progressive-and-young-voters-on-collision-course-with-white-house/" target="_blank">delegation of uncommitted voters</a> who oppose the war.</p>
<p>As many as 25,000 protestors are expected over the course of the convention, according to DemList, a newsletter for Democratic officials and allies.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A contest transformed</h4>

	
<p>Harris’ entry into the race, nearly immediately after Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/president-joe-biden-bows-out-reelection-campaign-harris-vows-win-nomination-8" target="_blank">announced on July 21</a> he would no longer seek reelection, energized Democrats distressed over Biden’s poor showings in polls against Trump, whose reelection bid Biden turned back in 2020.</p>
<p>A Monmouth University <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_081424/" target="_blank">poll published Aug. 14</a> showed a huge jump in enthusiasm for Democrats. The survey found 85% of Democratic respondents were excited about the Harris-Trump race. By comparison, only 46% of Democratic respondents said in June they were excited about a Biden-Trump race.</p>
<p>Harris is also seeing better polling numbers in matchups against Trump, with battleground-state and national surveys consistently shifting toward the Democratic ticket since Biden left the race.</p>
<p>Polls of seven battleground states <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/survey-research/2024-swing-state-project/fight-redefine-2024-race-president" target="_blank">published</a> by The Cook Political Report With Amy Walter on Aug. 14 showed Harris narrowly leading in five states — Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — and tied in Georgia and trailing in Nevada. All were improvements from Biden’s standing in the same poll in May.</p>
<p><a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3902" target="_blank">An Aug. 14 survey from Quinnipiac University</a> showed Harris with a 48%-45% edge in Pennsylvania. The 3-point advantage for Harris was within the poll’s margin of error.</p>
<p>Democrats hope to carry the momentum through the convention. Polls typically favor a party during and immediately after its national party gathering.</p>
<p>Despite the recent polling, Harris and Walz continue to describe themselves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkwZ_A49hb8" target="_blank">as underdogs in the race</a>.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Campaign themes</h4>

	
<p>In her short time on the campaign trail, Harris has emphasized a few core messages.</p>
<p>She’s made reproductive rights a central focus, including the slogan “We are not going back” in her stump speech after describing Republicans’ position on abortion. Additionally, a Texas woman who had to leave the state for an emergency abortion will speak at the DNC, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-woman-who-left-state-abortion-back-harris-convention-2024-08-15/" target="_blank">according to Reuters.</a></p>
<p>Harris has also played up her background as a prosecutor, drawing a contrast with Trump’s legal troubles.</p>
<p>Walz has highlighted his working-class background and military service, while attacking Republican positions to restrict reproductive rights and ban certain books in schools.</p>
<p>Walz’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/walz-first-solo-speech-vp-candidate-touts-dem-tickets-labor-union-ties" target="_blank">first solo campaign stop</a> since Harris selected him as her running mate was at a union convention, where he emphasized his union background as a high school teacher.</p>
<p>Walz was not initially considered the favorite to be Harris’ running mate, but his appeal as a Midwesterner with a record of winning tough elections and enacting progressive policies <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-picked-harris-her-running-mate-democratic-ticket" target="_blank">led to his selection</a> Aug. 6.</p>
<p>Harris has faced criticism for not sitting down for a formal media interview or holding a press conference since she became a candidate.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Platform in flux</h4>

	
<p>Democrats have not finalized their platform for 2024. Adopting a party platform is generally among the official items at a convention.</p>
<p>The party set <a href="https://democrats.org/news/dnc-releases-2024-party-platform-draft-outlining-historic-record-and-bold-agenda-for-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-to-finish-the-job/" target="_blank">a draft platform</a> in July just eight days before Biden dropped his reelection bid. The document centered on the theme of “finishing the job” and mentioned Biden, then the presumptive nominee, 50 times and Harris 12.</p>
<p>Party spokespeople did not respond to an inquiry this week about plans for an update to the platform.</p>
<p>Reproductive rights will likely be a focus point of any policy wishlist.</p>
<p>Harris, during her time as vice president, has led the administration’s messaging on reproductive rights after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in the summer of 2022.</p>
<p>In her campaign speeches, she has often stressed the need to “trust women” and that the government should not be deciding reproductive health.</p>
<p>Harris has often promised that if she is elected, she will restore those reproductive rights, but unless Democrats control a majority in the U.S. House and 60 Senate votes, it’s unlikely she would be able to achieve that promise.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/06/24/updated-u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">Roe v. Wade was overturned</a> in that Supreme Court decision, Democrats have campaigned on reproductive rights that expand beyond abortion and include protections for in vitro fertilization.</p>
<p><a href="https://democrats.org/where-we-stand/party-platform/" target="_blank">The 2020 party platform</a> focused on recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, the economy, quality health care, investing in education, protecting democracy and combating climate change.</p>
<p>Democrats are likely to continue to criticize the Project 2025 playbook — a blueprint by the Heritage Foundation, a think tank, to implement conservative policies across the federal government should Trump win in November.</p>
<p>Trump has disavowed the document, but has not detailed his own policy plans.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Chicago conventions</h4>

	
<p>The Democratic National Convention will take place in Chicago, a city with a long history of hosting the event. Democrats have held their convention in Chicago 11 times, first in 1864 and most recently in 1996.</p>
<p>This year’s will be the first in-person Democratic National Convention since 2016. It was upended due to the coronavirus pandemic and held virtually in 2020.</p>
<p>Throughout the four-day convention, there will be speeches and side events hosted by state Democratic party leaders.</p>
<p>The ceremonial roll call vote with delegates on the convention floor will take place Tuesday. The vice presidential nomination speech by Walz will be Wednesday night and on Thursday night, Harris will give her nomination acceptance speech.</p>
<p>The city is also preparing for massive protests from several groups on reproductive rights, LGBTQ protections, housing and an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, <a href="https://www.wbez.org/government-politics/dnc-2024/2024/08/12/dnc-democratic-national-convention-protests-kamala-harris-israel-gaza-lgbtq-reproductive-rights-cpd-police" target="_blank">according to WBEZ News. </a></p>
<p>The City Council of Chicago in January approved a ceasefire resolution, with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson the tiebreaker, making it the largest city to call for an end to the Israel-Hamas war, in which<a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaza-war-hamas-dead-graves-40000-988d16b648e06e222f04964dc9440da0?taid=66bdedd74b96700001cc25c8&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter" target="_blank"> more than 40,000 Palestinians have died</a>.</p>
<p>The war followed an Oct. 7 attack from Hamas, in which <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker" target="_blank">nearly 1,200 people</a> were killed in Israel and hundreds taken hostage.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Road to nomination</h4>

	
<p>Harris’ acceptance speech will cap a five-year journey to her party’s nomination.</p>
<p>In 2019, the California senator announced a bid for president in the next year’s election, but <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/03/784443227/kamala-harris-drops-out-of-presidential-race" target="_blank">dropped out</a> before the first primary or caucus votes were cast after she failed to catch on with Democratic voters.</p>
<p>Biden later picked her as a running mate, and the two defeated Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Biden launched a reelection campaign for 2024, but stepped aside after a disastrous debate performance in June spurred questions about his ability to campaign and serve for another four-year term.</p>
<p>After Biden bowed out, Harris <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democratic-delegates-swiftly-give-harris-enough-support-clinch-presidential-nomination" target="_blank">quickly secured 99%</a> of delegates <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kamala-harris-officially-becomes-democratic-presidential-nominee" target="_blank">to become the party’s likely nominee</a>. The virtual five-day vote secured her official nomination.</p>
<p>With less than three months until Election Day, Harris and Walz already have sprinted through battleground states including Arizona, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.</p>
<p>Their campaign has also pulled in more than $300 million, according to the campaign. Official Federal Election Commission records will be released in mid-October.</p>
<p>Harris and Trump have <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/08/08/trump-agrees-to-sept-10-debate-with-harris-claims-two-more-upcoming/" target="_blank">agreed to a Sept. 10 </a>debate hosted by ABC News in Philadelphia. Trump proposed two more debates, and Harris has said she would be open to another one between the first debate and Election Day.<br />
Walz and Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/mark-your-calendar-vp-candidates-walz-and-vance-debate-oct-1" target="_blank">agreed to an Oct. 1</a> debate on CBS News, in New York City.</p>

(Photo by Jabin Botsford-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p>Former President Donald Trump asked a New York court Thursday to delay until after November’s presidential election his sentencing for the 34 state felonies the court convicted him of in May.</p>
<p>Judge Juan Merchan scheduled a sentencing hearing for Sept. 18. But that date overlaps with early voting in the presidential election and gives Trump too little time to appeal a potential ruling against him on a request to vacate the conviction, which Merchan is scheduled to issue two days prior, attorneys Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote to Merchan <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25045316-20240814-letter-to-justice-merchan-re-sentencing-adjournment" target="_blank">in a letter</a> dated Wednesday.</p>
<p>The one-page letter was not on the court’s official docket Thursday morning, but Blanche provided a copy to States Newsroom and said it had been filed with the court.</p>
<p>Merchan’s schedule is unrealistic and ignores several related issues, Trump’s attorneys wrote.</p>
<p>A sentencing proceeding could improperly affect voters’ perception of Trump leading up to Election Day, and Merchan’s daughter’s ties to elected Democrats could undermine the public’s faith in the court, they wrote.</p>
<p>While Merchan has rejected three requests from Trump that he recuse himself from the case because of his daughter’s employment at a company that produces advertising campaigns for Democrats, Trump’s lawyers said delaying the sentencing would help mitigate any potential appearance of a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Trump’s Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, continue to discuss the case on the campaign trail. And the founder of the firm where Merchan’s daughter works has expressed his support for Harris on social media, Blanche and Bove wrote.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election entanglements</h4>

	
<p>The Sept. 18 sentencing is also scheduled “after the commencement of early voting in the Presidential election,” they wrote.</p>
<p>“By adjourning the sentencing until after that election … the Court would reduce, even if not eliminate, issues regarding the integrity of any future proceedings,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania law allows the earliest voting, according to a<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/early-in-person-voting" target="_blank"> database</a> compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Pennsylvania counties are permitted to hold early voting 50 days before Election Day, which is Sept. 16.</p>
<p>It is unclear if any counties in the key battleground state are planning to make voting available that soon.</p>
<p>No other states allow voting before Sept. 18, according to the NCSL database. Blanche did not answer an emailed question about what early voting he was referring to in the letter.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Presidential immunity</h4>

	
<p>Trump’s attorneys said the sentencing hearing should also be moved to accommodate another issue in the case: Trump’s presidential immunity argument.</p>
<p>Trump has asked for his conviction to be overturned following a U.S. Supreme Court decision that ruled presidents were entitled to a broad definition of criminal immunity for acts they take in office.</p>
<p>Merchan set a Sept. 16 date to rule on the request the state conviction be set aside, but Trump’s attorneys said that does not leave enough time for Trump to appeal a potentially unfavorable ruling on the immunity issue.</p>
<p>“The requested adjournment is also necessary to allow President Trump adequate time to assess and pursue state and federal appellate options in response to any adverse ruling,” they wrote.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court decision that established presidential immunity arose from a pretrial appeal, they wrote.</p>
<p>A New York jury<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank"> convicted</a> Trump in May of 34 felony counts of falsified business records, making him the first former president to be convicted of a felony. Trump was accused of sending $130,000, through attorney  Michael Cohen, to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the weeks before the 2016 election to buy her silence about<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/porn-star-stormy-daniels-nyc-hush-money-trial-alleges-sexual-encounter-trump" target="_blank"> an alleged sexual encounter</a> years earlier.</p>
<p>Merchan initially set sentencing for July 11.</p>
<p>But after the Supreme Court<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/presidential-immunity-covers-some-official-acts-supreme-court-rules-trump-case" target="_blank"> ruled on July 1</a> that presidents enjoy full immunity from criminal charges for their official acts, the New York judge agreed to delay sentencing to first rule on how the Supreme Court decision affected the New York case.</p>
<p>While much of the conduct alleged in the New York case took place before Trump was in office, his attorneys have argued that the prosecution also included investigations into Oval Office meetings with Cohen that could be impermissible under the Supreme Court’s standard.</p>

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)</p><p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made his first solo campaign appearance as the Democratic vice presidential candidate Tuesday, telling a union audience in Los Angeles that the Democratic ticket led by Vice President Kamala Harris would prioritize worker-friendly policies.</p>
<p>Walz appeared to tailor most of his 20-minute speech to the audience of members of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a 1.4-million-member union of public-sector workers.</p>
<p>Walz, who was a union member as a public school teacher in southern Minnesota before he won a U.S. House seat in 2006, praised the policies Harris championed as part of President Joe Biden’s administration, and those he pushed as Minnesota governor.</p>
<p>Walz and Harris come from working-class backgrounds, he said, noting that Harris worked at McDonald’s as a student.</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris took that work ethic, goes to work every single day to make sure families don’t just get by, but they get ahead,” he said.</p>
<p>Harris led the administration’s work to eliminate barriers to organizing and cast the tiebreaking vote in the U.S. Senate to pass the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill in 2021 that Walz said kept public-sector workers employed during the pandemic.</p>
<p>As governor, Walz said he made it easier to form unions, strengthened worker protections and banned “those damn captive audience meetings for good,” referring to meetings employers can mandate workers attend ahead of union votes to discourage support for organizing.</p>
<p>Both Walz and Harris have walked on picket lines with striking workers, he said.</p>
<p>Walz is the second person who has been a union member to appear on a presidential ticket since Ronald Reagan, who led the Screen Actors Guild before a career in politics, in 1984. Unlike the two-term Republican president, who engaged in a high-profile standoff with the federal air traffic controllers’ union, Walz told the audience he would not “lose (his) way” once elected.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump was also a member of SAG-AFTRA, the successor organization to the Screen Actors Guild, when he ran for president in 2016 and 2020. Trump, who was nominated by Republicans in July as their presidential candidate, is no longer a member.</p>
<p>Walz called on the union audience to get involved in campaign organizing, saying that if the group could mobilize friends and neighbors, it could make a difference in an election that could be decided by tens of thousands of votes in a few key states.</p>
<p>“This is going to be a close, tough race,” he said. “But if each of us does an extra shift, an extra hour, a little bit more, we get to wake up on that morning after the election and know that the work we did transformed the lives for millions, transformed generations, impacted the world.”</p>
<p>He closed with a campaign slogan Harris has been using, leading the crowd in a chant of, “When we fight, we win.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Attack on GOP</h4>

	
<p>Walz asked for organized labor to help turn out Democratic voters in November.</p>
<p>“I know I’m preaching to the choir a little bit today,” he said. “But the choir needs to sing.”</p>
<p>Trump and his running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, were “not in the choir” of union supporters, Walz said.</p>
<p>Trump has said he supports “right-to-work” laws that make union organizing difficult, Walz said.</p>
<p>Walz related a conversation he’d had with United Autoworkers President Shawn Fain in which the labor leader called Trump a derisive name for an anti-union worker over his position on such laws.</p>
<p>“I saw our friend Shawn Fain at the UAW had a name for that, he called him a scab,” Walz said. “That’s not name-calling, it’s an observation in fact, just to be clear.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Project 2025</h4>

	
<p>A second Trump administration would work to “put the screws to working people,” Walz said, noting that sections of the “Project 2025 to-do list” call for restricting union organizing and reducing overtime.</p>
<p>Project 2025 is a list of policy goals developed by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, with input from former Trump administration officials. Democrats have worked to tie Trump to the document they describe as radically conservative.</p>
<p>Trump has denied any involvement in its drafting and has not committed to working toward it if elected.</p>
<p>Walz, a former high school football coach, said Trump was “playing dumb” about the contents of Project 2025.</p>
<p>“I’m a football coach at heart,” he said. “I’ll tell you one thing I know for sure is, if you’re going to take the time to draw up a playbook, you’re damn sure going to use it.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Broader message</h4>

	
<p>Walz also peppered his remarks with messages seemingly meant for a broader general-election audience, advocating for reproductive rights and criticizing restrictions on book bans some Republican states have led against gender or race-based content and Trump’s position on cutting taxes for the wealthy.</p>
<p>Highlighting the campaign’s theme of freedom, Walz said the government should not be involved in “personal choices” about how to start a family, what books to read or whether to join a union.</p>
<p>“This country is great because we have a golden rule that makes things work. We mind our own damn business on those things,” he said.</p>
<p>He also defended against criticisms of his record in the Army National Guard that has come under scrutiny from Republicans, including Vance, who is a Marine Corps veteran. They have said Walz exaggerated his role and left his unit months before it was deployed to Iraq in 2005.</p>
<p>Walz said he was proud of his 24 years of service in the National Guard, which only ended in 2005 so he could run for Congress, where he joined the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>“I’m proud of my service to this country,” he said. “And I firmly believe you should never denigrate another person’s service record. Anyone brave enough to put on that uniform for our great country, including my opponent, I just have a few simple words: Thank you for your service and sacrifice.”</p>
<p><em>CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this report said Walz was the first former union member since Ronald Reagan to appear on a presidential ticket, after he said during his speech he was the first union member since Reagan. He is the second person who has been a union member to be on a presidential ticket since 1984.</em></p>

The press conference was held to address Project 2025 and Republican policies on abortion. (Photo by Jim Vondruska/Getty Images)</p><p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday in a move meant to boost the Democratic ticket’s appeal in key Midwestern states and with blue-collar voters.</p>
<p>Walz, a former social studies teacher and Army National Guard veteran who won challenging elections in a rural U.S. House district before running for governor in 2018 and winning reelection in 2022, balances Harris geographically and demographically, while bringing a history of campaign wins in purple-to-red areas and a governing record among the most progressive of any contender to join the ticket.</p>
<p>“One of the things that stood out to me about Tim is how his convictions on fighting for middle class families run deep,” Harris wrote in a statement. “It’s personal. As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he’s delivered for working families like his own. We are going to build a great partnership. We start out as underdogs but I believe together, we can win this election.”</p>
<p>Walz was also seen as the preferred vice presidential pick of the party’s progressive wing, especially as an alternative to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Harris <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/vp-speculation-hits-fever-pitch-harris-announcement-expected-very-soon" target="_blank">interviewed both governors</a>, and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, in Washington Sunday as she whittled down her shortlist.</p>
<p>Little known until recently outside his home state to all but the closest political observers, Walz’s laid-back style and approachable demeanor — and straightforward attacks on Republican rivals Donald Trump and J.D. Vance — over weeks of consistent national TV appearances won praise from Democratic officials and strategists who have struggled to break Trump’s hold over white voters without college degrees.</p>
<p>Walz, 60, emerged in recent weeks as one of the party’s top communicators through the power of a single adjective for Republicans and their policy goals.</p>
<p>“These are weird people on the other side,” Walz said in a July 23 interview on MSNBC. “They want to take books away, they want to be in your exam room … These are weird ideas.”</p>
<p>Despite the best efforts of President Joe Biden’s abandoned reelection bid to describe Republicans under Trump’s leadership as a threat to U.S. democracy and reproductive rights who couldn’t be trusted to responsibly govern, the attacks didn’t stick and Trump continued to climb in the polls.</p>
<p>But shortly after Biden’s July 21 exit from the race, Democrats embraced the succinct message that has been credited to the Minnesota governor.</p>
<p>“I am loving Tim Walz on TV,” Rebecca Pearcey, a Democratic strategist, told States Newsroom in a July interview on potential vice presidential picks for Harris.</p>
<p>“I love that he’s just so down-to-earth and so pithy and that he’s like, ‘These guys are weird,’” she added. “That’s exactly it — we are overcomplicating what this message has to be.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Shapiro said he was grateful to have been considered for Harris’ running mate and would continue his work as governor, calling that role “the highest honor” of his life.</p>
<p>Shapiro congratulated Walz, saying he would be an “exceptionally strong addition to the ticket.” He said he would work to help the Harris-Walz ticket win in November.</p>
<p>“Vice President Kamala Harris has my enthusiastic support – and I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,” he wrote. “Over the next 92 days, I look forward to traveling all across the Commonwealth to unite Pennsylvanians behind Kamala Harris’ campaign to defeat Donald Trump, become the 47th President of the United States, and build a better future for our country.”</p>
<p>According to his official schedule, Shapiro is scheduled to speak at Walz’s first public appearance with Harris, a rally in Philadelphia Tuesday evening.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Far-left radical’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after reports of the Walz choice surfaced, Trump’s campaign blasted him in a statement that sought to undercut his appeal to rural Midwestern voters and tie him to Harris’ Bay Area background, potentially previewing the attacks Walz will see throughout the three months leading up to Election Day.</p>
<p>“It’s no surprise that San Francisco Liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running-mate – Walz has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State,” Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.</p>
<p>“If Walz won’t tell voters the truth, we will: just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist, and the Harris-Walz California dream is every American’s nightmare.”</p>
<p>Leavitt highlighted Walz’s signature on a bill to require the state move to 100% non-carbon energy by 2040.</p>
<p>A political action committee associated with Trump also slammed the Minnesota governor.</p>
<p>A written statement from MAGA Inc. criticized Walz’s positions on transgender rights and immigration, as well as his response to the riots in Minneapolis after police there killed George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.</p>
<p>The PAC also sought to tie Walz to a federal fraud case in the state that saw <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/06/07/five-feeding-our-future-defendants-found-guilty-two-acquitted-in-sprawling-fraud-case/" target="_blank">five convicted</a> in federal court of taking federal COVID-19 relief money intended to feed needy children. The case dealt with a nonprofit, but a June report from the state auditor found the state’s Department of Education failed to properly oversee the federal payments.</p>
<p>“Governor Tim Walz and Kamala Harris will get along just great,” the statement said. “They’re both far-left radicals that don’t know how to govern.”</p>
<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is also from San Francisco, said in an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Tuesday that characterizations of Walz as far-left were “mystifying.”</p>
<p>“To characterize him as left is so unreal,” Pelosi <a href="https://x.com/Morning_Joe/status/1820815933637537872" target="_blank">said</a>. “He’s right down the middle. He’s a heartland-of-America Democrat.”</p>
<p>As the top Democrat on the U.S. House Veterans Affairs Committee, Walz made “tremendous, tremendous gains” for veterans, Pelosi said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Communicating rural values</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Walz, who grew up in a rural community in Nebraska, has slammed national Republicans for a relentless focus on cultural issues. He’s trained that criticism recently on Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio whose rise to Republican vice presidential nominee was built on his controversial book detailing the lives of people in impoverished rural areas of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Vance and Republicans have “obsessions” with taking away rights, Walz has said, especially related to reproductive rights and education that includes discussion of gender and sexuality.</p>
<p>“The golden rule that makes small towns work so we’re not at each other’s throats all the time in a little town is: Mind your own damn business,” Walz told MSNBC’s Jen Psaki on July 25. “I don’t need him (Vance) to tell me about my family, I don’t need him to tell me about my wife’s health care and her reproductive rights, I don’t need him telling my children what books to read.”</p>
<p>Walz instead projects a pragmatic vision of Democratic governance.</p>
<p>“They scream socialism, we just build roads and we build schools and we build prosperity into this,” he told Psaki.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Working-class message</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As governor, Walz has notched a series of policy wins he can boast to the party’s progressive wing about. He signed laws to offer free meals to all public school students, expand abortion access and legalize some recreational uses of THC.</p>
<p>But the sometimes bespectacled former high school teacher and football coach, who has donned t-shirts and hunting caps in national TV hits, also projects an image of Midwestern pragmatism.</p>
<p>That may help balance voters’ views of a Democratic ticket led by Harris, who would be the first woman president, the first president of South Asian descent and the second Black president, and who is seen as more liberal than most in the party after climbing the ranks through Democratic primaries in California.</p>
<p>Christopher Devine, a political scientist at the University of Dayton, said Walz’s appeal is not unlike that of Harris’ last running mate.</p>
<p>“Walz has a message that kind of reminds me of Joe Biden’s appeal, kind of a working-class focus,” he said. “He can speak from a rural background, he’s been a teacher and a coach and has a military background as well. He seems to me like he’s someone who could maybe help with kind of a working-class message.”</p>
<p>The campaign will depend on Walz to carry that message to neighboring Wisconsin and other crucial Rust Belt states such as Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p>

(Photo by Octavio Jones/Getty Images)</p><p>Voter intimidation, an exodus of election workers fed up with harassment and continued misinformation and disinformation campaigns threaten the integrity of the November elections, officials with the government watchdog group Common Cause said Tuesday.</p>
<p>This year will be the first presidential election since “the big lie,” Common Cause President Virginia Kase Solomón said on a video call with reporters.</p>
<p>She was referring to the effort by then-President Donald Trump and his allies to undermine Trump’s reelection loss in 2020 by promoting a series of unfounded conspiracy theories and encouraging supporters to obstruct Congress’ certification of the results on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Common Cause is a nonpartisan organization and Solomón and other speakers did not mention Trump, who is again the Republican nominee for president, by name.</p>
<p>But Solomón said the country’s election integrity was damaged by the 2020 experience, with many veteran election workers opting to leave the profession rather than deal with the threats and harassment from believers in election conspiracies.</p>
<p>“We’re still living with the legacy of those lies,” she said. “They’ve undermined the faith of many Americans in our elections and fed anger and heated rhetoric … Those lies have also led to threats and harassment to election officials who have seen massive turnover in their ranks.”</p>
<p>On top of those challenges, election workers and voters also must deal this cycle with improving generative artificial intelligence tools that make disinformation easier than ever, Common Cause experts said.</p>
<p>And state laws, such as a measure that went into effect in Florida after the 2022 elections to cancel automatic delivery of vote-by-mail ballots, promise further confusion and disenfranchisement, they said.</p>
<p>To combat those threats to election integrity, the group is gearing up for campaign-season education drives.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Threats of violence</h4>

	
<p>Instances of actual political violence remain rare, said Suzanne Almeida, a Common Cause director of state operations who also leads the group’s work on political violence.</p>
<p>But threats, militant language, doxing and other harassment continue, Almeida said.</p>
<p>That has affected election workers, with a recent<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/poll-election-officials-finds-concerns-about-safety-political" target="_blank"> study</a> from the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice finding that 38% of election workers had experienced threats and more than half of local election officials feared for their safety.</p>
<p>While surveys, including a recent University of California-Davis<a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/news/headlines/new-study-looks-at-attitudes-towards-political-violence/2023/09" target="_blank"> study</a>, show that voters of both parties reject political violence, “candidates who have large platforms” have used them to drive turnout, Almeida said.</p>
<p>“We are seeing the normalization of hate, violent rhetoric, violent threats and harassment as a viable political strategy,” she said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not respond to a message seeking comment Tuesday.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">AI and misinformation</h4>

	
<p>Intentional efforts to disinform voters and accidental spreading of misinformation remain a growing problem, Common Cause’s media and democracy program director Ishan Mehta said.</p>
<p>The expansion and improvement of generative artificial intelligence makes it easier to create and spread fraudulent campaign content.</p>
<p>“The ubiquity of these tools means that you don’t have to be a computer expert anymore to have misinformation that would convince a lot, over half the population,” Mehta said.</p>
<p>Social media platforms that surged misinformation enforcement after Jan. 6 have now backed off enforcing misinformation, he said.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/us/politics/elon-musk-kamala-harris-deepfake.html" target="_blank">tweeted</a> a doctored video of likely Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris over the weekend. Musk, who has endorsed Trump, bought the platform in 2022. He boasts 192 million followers.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Deploying poll monitors</h4>

	
<p>While predicting widespread violence on Election Day would not happen, Common Cause Pennsylvania Executive Director Philip Hensley-Robin anticipated some instances of political violence or intimidation.</p>
<p>The group would send “hundreds of poll monitors” across the commonwealth to record such instances, with monitors who will also be trained in deescalation, he said.</p>
<p>Hensley-Robin began his remarks by acknowledging the “tragic events” of the assassination attempt on Trump at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, but said the “isolated incident” would not deter voters from turning out.</p>
<p>He also anticipated that some would mount “spurious” lawsuits to “disenfranchise voters and undermine public confidence” in the election, but predicted those would be quickly dismissed.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign lost scores of lawsuits challenging 2020 election results.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voter outreach</h4>

	
<p>Solomón said Common Cause would be reminding voters to be on the lookout for misinformation and disinformation, especially from AI, and that it’s likely Election Day will end without a clear winner in the presidential race, a situation that has encouraged conspiracy theories about election fraud.</p>
<p>“That’s not a sign that anything is wrong,” she said.</p>
<p>The group will also be in touch with election workers to understand their needs and to offer assistance, she said.</p>
<p>She added that democracy had to be proactive.</p>
<p>“In the 2020 election, I think there was a false narrative that came out of that, and that was that democracy held and did what it was supposed to do,” she said. “And one of the things that I like to remind people of is that democracy did not hold. We made it hold.”</p>

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday, he said in <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815080881981190320" target="_blank">a letter posted to social media</a>, creating an unprecedented vacancy atop the Democratic ticket one month before he was scheduled to officially accept his party’s nomination.</p>
<p>In a followup <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933" target="_blank">post</a> less than 30 minutes later, Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place as the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>Biden’s withdrawal came after a weeks-long pressure campaign from party insiders following a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-reel-terrible-biden-debate-performance-he-defends-candidacy%C2%A0" target="_blank">disastrous</a> June 27 debate performance against GOP candidate former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The move throws an already-unusual presidential race into further chaos, and it was not immediately clear Sunday how Democrats would choose a replacement for Biden in November’s election, though Harris would have a strong claim to lead the ticket.</p>
<p>Biden praised Harris as “an extraordinary partner” in the administration’s accomplishments.</p>
<p>Biden, who has been fighting a COVID-19 infection at home in Delaware since last week, was not specific about his reasons for stepping aside, but said he believed it was in the country’s best interest.</p>
<p>“It has been the great honor of my life to serve as your President,” he wrote in the one-page letter. “And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.”</p>
<p>Biden, 81, appeared frail and confused at several points throughout the debate, leading to worries among elected Democrats and the party’s voters that he was no longer up to the task of governing or contesting Trump’s bid to win back the White House.</p>
<p>As several congressional Democrats called for him to quit the race, others asked that he ramp up his public schedule and include more unrehearsed appearances that could demonstrate his fitness.</p>
<p>But a more robust schedule of news interviews, press conferences and campaign rallies did not sufficiently quiet the Democratic voices saying Biden’s candidacy was likely to throw the presidential race to Trump – whom Biden and others have described as an existential threat to U.S. democracy – and deeply handicap Democrats in other races up and down November’s ballot.</p>
<p>On Friday, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and <a href="https://sourcenm.com/2024/07/19/sen-heinrich-calls-on-biden-to-drop-out/" target="_blank">Martin Heinrich of New Mexico</a> brought the number of senators calling on Biden to drop out to four. A day earlier, Montana Sen. Jon Tester <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2024/07/18/sen-tester-calls-on-biden-not-to-seek-another-term/" target="_blank">said</a> Biden should drop his reelection campaign and that Democrats should hold an open nomination process at their Chicago convention next month.</p>
<p>In the U.S. House, 29 Democrats had called for Biden to withdraw from the race by the end of the day July 19.</p>
<p>In a post following the announcement to his social media site, Truth Social, Trump said Biden was “never” fit to serve as president.</p>
<p>“Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve – And never was!” Trump wrote. “He only attained the position of President by lies, Fake News, and not leaving his Basement. All those around him, including his Doctor and the Media, knew that he wasn’t capable of being President, and he wasn’t – And now, look what he’s done to our Country.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More details of announcement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In the letter, Biden praised his administration’s accomplishments over three-and-a-half years, saying he’d worked to make “historic investments” in the country, lowered prescription drug costs, nominated the first Black woman to the U.S. Supreme Court and “passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world.”</p>
<p>“Together we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,”  Biden wrote. “We’ve protected and preserved our Democracy. And we’ve revitalized and strengthened our alliances around the world.”</p>
<p>Biden said he would “speak to the Nation later this week” about the decision.</p>
<p>He praised Harris and other supporters.</p>
<p>“For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me reelected,” he wrote. “I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work. And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me.”</p>
<p>In follow-up posts, Biden said he was endorsing Harris and added a fundraising link.</p>
<p>“My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,” he said. “And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump gains in polls</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The about face in what was to be a 2020 presidential election rematch leaves Democrats searching for a new candidate as Trump, who promises authoritarian-style leadership, has gained support in recent polls.</p>
<p>With just 107 days until Election Day, Biden’s move marks the latest date in modern presidential history that a candidate has withdrawn from the race.</p>
<p>President Lyndon Johnson announced in March 1968 that he would not seek reelection that year, leaving Democratic delegates to decide on a replacement – ultimately Vice President Hubert Humphrey – at the party’s convention that summer in Chicago.</p>
<p>Harris appears to be in a strong position to replace Biden as the party’s standard bearer, though questions remain about how the process will play out and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pa-gov-josh-shapiro-would-bring-battleground-state-and-political-acumen-national-ticket" target="_blank">who</a> would become the vice presidential nominee.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats praise decision</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Reaction poured in shortly after the Sunday afternoon announcement, with Democrats largely praising Biden’s record and calling his decision courageous.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that he understood Biden’s decision to step out of the race was “not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first.”</p>
<p>“Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he is a truly amazing human being,” the New York Democrat said.</p>
<p>Several Republicans called for Biden to resign his office.</p>
<p>“If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President,” House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on X. “He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A crescendoing chorus to step down</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden faced calls for him to abandon his reelection bid from congressional Democrats, even as he tried to stabilize the debate aftershock by holding a series of campaign rallies, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-first-tv-interview-debate-denies-medical-condition-it-was-bad-episode" target="_blank">sitting down</a> for <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-says-bulls-eye-remark-about-trump-was-mistake-defends-criticism" target="_blank">interviews</a> and holding a press conference at<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-nato-press-conference-rebuts-doubters-im-best-qualified-govern" target="_blank"> the annual NATO conference</a>.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congressional-dems-urge-more-robust-biden-campaign-trail-few-openly-revolt" target="_blank">largely</a> <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/united-their-objections-trump-congressional-dems-largely-close-ranks-behind-biden" target="_blank">presented</a> a public front of support for Biden in statements and passing interviews in the U.S. Capitol hallways with reporters.</p>
<p>What began as a trickle of dissent from rank-and-file Democrats — <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-us-house-member-calls-biden-withdraw-amid-debate-fallout" target="_blank">beginning</a> with Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas and a handful of doubtful senior House Democrats — steadily grew to a torrent by Friday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">50-year career in Washington</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden’s exit marks the closure of a long, storied career in Washington, including 38 years in the U.S. Senate, featuring stints leading the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees, and eight years as vice president under President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Biden’s presidency was punctuated with major economic wins for Democrats, beginning with nearly $2 trillion to combat the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>His leadership with a Democratic majority in Congress resulted in substantial nationwide infrastructure investments, drove financial incentives to tackle climate change and revive the U.S. global role in semiconductor manufacturing, and strengthened flagging tax enforcement.</p>
<p>However, low approval ratings followed Biden throughout his presidency as Americans aimed their frustrations over inflation at the White House and assigned blame for record numbers of border crossings as a divided Congress – after Democrats lost their House majority in the 2022 midterms – failed to pass immigration restrictions negotiated with the administration.</p>
<p>Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war also hurt his support among young and progressive voters as Israel’s continued offensive against Hamas militants in the Palestinian territory of the Gaza Strip killed tens of thousands of civilians. Protesters against the U.S. supply of weapons to Israel interrupted dozens of Biden’s reelection campaign events through 2024.</p>

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden dug in on his 2024 reelection bid Thursday at a solo press conference following the NATO summit in Washington, despite a growing list of rank-and-file Democrats and high-profile supporters urging him to abandon his campaign over suspected health concerns.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated press conference followed weeks of speculation about Biden’s ability to hold office and whether he should remain in the 2024 presidential election against former President Donald Trump. His performance, while markedly stronger than his <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-and-trump-trade-insults-accusations-lying-acrimonious-presidential-debate" target="_blank">devastating debate performance</a>, still included a notable gaffe and could leave questions open.</p>
<p>In response to the first question, about if Vice President Kamala Harris would be an able candidate against Trump, Biden mixed up their names.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president if I didn’t think she was not qualified to be president,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden fielded a wide range of questions from reporters from both the U.S. and overseas for just less than an hour. The meeting with the press came exactly two weeks after the June 27 debate, during which Biden stumbled repeatedly, spoke in a hoarse voice and appeared unable to finish some sentences.</p>
<p>Biden and the White House have repeatedly attributed the debate as a “bad night” and pointed to clean results from his last three annual physical examinations.</p>
<p>Asked directly about congressional Democrats’ <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-camp-works-stem-growing-democratic-unease-over-reelection-prospects" target="_blank">unease</a> about his candidacy, Biden said he had made a final decision to remain in the race, but was working to show doubters he was up to the task and responding to criticism that he could not handle impromptu questioning.</p>
<p>“I’m determined on running,” he said. “But I think it’s important that I allay fears by seeing — let them see me out there.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Not stepping aside</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>He added that delegates pledged to him through the Democratic nominating process should be free to vote their conscience, but that no one had a better alternative to his candidacy against Trump, the presumed Republican candidate.</p>
<p>“I believe I’m the best qualified to govern and I think I’m the best qualified to win,” Biden said. “But there are other people who could beat Trump, too, but it’s awful hard to start from scratch.”</p>
<p>Asked if he would step aside if his polling data showed Harris could beat Trump, Biden said he would not, unless it also showed he could not win.</p>
<p>“No one’s saying that,” he added in a whisper. “No poll says that.”</p>
<p>Harris is seen as the likeliest replacement for Biden if he were to leave the race.</p>
<p>A trickle of congressional Democrats calling for him to leave the race <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-us-house-member-calls-biden-withdraw-amid-debate-fallout" target="_blank">since</a> July 2 <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-camp-works-stem-growing-democratic-unease-over-reelection-prospects" target="_blank">turned</a> to a stream this week — with some reports indicating a poor performance Thursday night could give way to a flood.</p>
<p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a decades-long friend of Biden’s, <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/nancy-pelosi-it-s-up-to-biden-to-decide-if-he-s-going-to-run-214554181531" target="_blank">urged</a> colleagues in an MSNBC interview Wednesday to “let (Biden) deal with this NATO conference, this is a very big deal.”</p>
<p>At the time Biden began his Thursday press conference, 14 Democrats in Congress had explicitly called for him to leave the race, with others suggesting it.</p>
<p>Shortly after the press conference concluded, two more, Connecticut’s Jim Himes and California’s Scott Peters, called on Biden to step aside.</p>
<p>Biden should “make room for a new generation of leaders,” Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, wrote in a statement <a href="https://x.com/jahimes/status/1811558379661185359" target="_blank">posted to X</a>.</p>
<p>Peters’ statement was <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/11/congress/how-dem-lawmakers-viewed-bidens-performance-00167743" target="_blank">provided to Politico</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Emphasis on foreign policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden, who has rarely held press conferences, consulted a list of reporters and took questions that ranged from his fitness to serve as president to his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>He lauded his accomplishments in office and said his job performance showed he was still up for the job.</p>
<p>“If I slow down, I can’t get the job done, that’s a sign that I shouldn’t be doing it,” he said. “But there’s no indication of that yet. None.”</p>
<p>Biden — a former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee — appeared more comfortable on foreign policy questions than he was discussing his political future, providing in-depth answers on the Israel-Hamas war, China’s growing influence on the world stage and Ukraine’s war with Russia.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump mocks Biden</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While Biden’s voice and grasp on the issues appeared stronger than he was at the debate, he still made several speaking mistakes, including the confusion between his vice president and Trump.</p>
<p>Trump mocked the mix-up on his social media platform Truth Social with a post saying “Great job, Joe!”</p>
<p>Later, Biden said Harris was qualified to be president and that is why he picked her as a running mate. His comments were worthy of attention given Harris would likely become the nominee if Biden were to step down.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden attacks Trump on NATO</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden declared the summit a “great success” and underlined the U.S. commitment to the alliance and to Ukraine’s war against Russia.</p>
<p>“For those who thought NATO’s time had passed, they got a rude awakening when Putin invaded Ukraine. Some of the oldest and deepest fears in Europe roared back to life because once again a murderous madman was on the march. This time, no one cowered in appeasement, especially the United States,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Prior to taking questions, he attacked Trump’s record of disparaging NATO and its foundational commitment to defend fellow member nations. The former president has threatened to withdraw from NATO and accused allies of shortchanging the organization’s defense coffers.</p>
<p>“A strong NATO is essential to American security, and I believe the obligation of Article Five is sacred. And I remind all Americans, Article Five was invoked only once in NATO’s long history, and that was to defend America after 9/11,” Biden said.</p>
<p>The three-day summit largely centered on Russia’s ongoing bombardment and occupation of parts of Ukraine. World leaders promised a path for Ukraine to join the alliance, and the event culminated with the U.S. joining two dozen allies in signing the Ukraine Compact to “(a)ffirm that the security of Ukraine is integral to the security of the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond.”</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?536945-1/president-biden-meets-ukrainian-president-zelensky" target="_blank">sat down</a> with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier Thursday to underscore military assistance including “working with our NATO allies to ensure Ukraine is flying F-16s this summer.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy thanked Biden for his “support and personal statement” following Russia’s strike on a children’s hospital in Kyiv Monday. Biden shook his head and responded the attack was “sick.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Another flub</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Between his meeting with Zelenskyy and the press conference, Biden introduced the Ukrainian president at a separate event to sign the compact, but mistakenly called him President Putin — the Russian leader at war with Zelenskyy’s country — before correcting himself.</p>
<p>When asked about the blunder, Biden acknowledged that he made the mistake but said that he corrected it immediately.</p>
<p>“I thought it was the most successful conference I’ve attended in a long time and find me a world leader who didn’t think it was,” he replied.</p>
<p>Biden did not stumble earlier in the week <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/07/09/biden-commends-nato-strength-pledges-more-aid-for-ukraine-against-russia/" target="_blank">when he delivered remarks</a> at NATO’s 75th anniversary event; rather, his voice remained steady and firm as he opened the ceremony for leaders from the 32 member nations.</p>

(Photo by Brendan McDermid-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. presidents enjoy full immunity from criminal charges for their official “core constitutional” acts, but no immunity for unofficial acts, the Supreme Court ruled Monday, sending former President Donald Trump’s case back to the lower courts.</p>
<p>The justices left open the question of how far official acts can reach, possibly reshaping the contours of the American presidency.</p>
<p>Trump escalated his immunity claim to the nation’s highest bench after two lower courts <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-claim-presidential-immunity-turned-down-federal-appeals-court-dc" target="_blank">denied</a> his request for protection from federal criminal charges alleging he schemed to overturn the 2020 presidential results.</p>
<p>The decision about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee’s actions while in office likely <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/delayed-supreme-court-ruling-makes-trump-trial-2020-charges-unlikely-election" target="_blank">closes the door</a> to any chance that Trump’s election subversion case could go to trial before Election Day.</p>
<p>The justices took up the case in February but did not hear <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-floats-return-trial-court-trump-presidential-immunity-case" target="_blank">oral arguments</a> until April 25.</p>
<p>The trial court must now grapple with whether Trump’s alleged conduct to spread false information about the 2020 election results and conspiring to overturn them qualified as official presidential action.</p>
<p>In a 6-3 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf" target="_blank">opinion</a>, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the president is subject to criminal prosecution for unofficial acts, “like everyone else.”</p>
<p>“But unlike anyone else, the President is a branch of government, and the Constitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties,” Roberts wrote. “Accounting for that reality—and ensuring that the President may exercise those powers forcefully, as the Framers anticipated he would—does not place him above the law; it preserves the basic structure of the Constitution.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court held that Trump’s conversations with Department of Justice officials regarding the election results were official but left unanswered questions about other conduct named in Department of Justice special counsel Jack’s Smith <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">indictment</a> of Trump.</p>
<p>“​​Certain allegations—such as those involving Trump’s discussions with the Acting Attorney General—are readily categorized in light of the nature of the President’s official relationship to the office held by that individual,” the opinion reads. “Other allegations— such as those involving Trump’s interactions with the Vice President, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public—present more difficult questions.”</p>
<p>In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the decision makes the president “immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to violate criminal law.”</p>
<p>“If the occupant of that office misuses official power for personal gain, the criminal law that the rest of us must abide will not provide a backstop,” Sotomayor wrote. “With fear for our democracy, I dissent.”</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-makes-one-last-presidential-immunity-argument-us-supreme-court" target="_blank">claimed</a> in court filings that he could not be prosecuted for actions he took while still in office. His legal team also argues that former presidents cannot be tried in the court of law unless they are first impeached by the U.S. House and convicted by the Senate.</p>
<p>The indictment, which a federal grand jury handed up in August 2023, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">alleges</a> Trump knowingly spread falsehoods to his supporters, plotting with co-conspirators to overturn results in seven states and eventually working his base into a frenzy that culminated in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the day Congress was to certify electoral votes.</p>
<p>DOJ’s Smith <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">charged</a> the former president with conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of, and attempt to obstruct, an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.</p>

Biden and Trump are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p><p>President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump pitched to undecided voters Thursday night during the first debate of the presidential campaign — trading insults over their policy differences, immigration and who represents a threat to democracy.</p>
<p>During the debate from CNN’s headquarters in Atlanta, the two men argued over who can do better for Americans during the next four years on a broad swath of issues, ranging from the economy to climate change to foreign policy. Each repeatedly accused the other of lying.</p>
<p>Biden early in the debate spoke softly at several points, coughed and gave several somewhat confusing answers. At one point, Biden appeared to lose his train of thought and ended an answer with the statement that “we finally beat Medicare.”</p>
<p>The two disagreed sharply over access to reproductive rights, including abortion, with Trump arguing Democrats’ position is “radical” and Biden saying that leaving decisions up to the states has been “terrible” for women.</p>
<p>Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, did not shake hands at the beginning, a break from past debates.</p>
<p>Near the end of the debate, Trump said political violence was “totally unacceptable,” though he went on to downplay the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, defending the conduct of his mob of supporters.</p>
<p>Trump initially did not directly answer a question about whether he would accept the results of the election if he lost. When pressed by moderator Dana Bash, Trump conditioned his answer.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jabs over personal conduct</h4>

	
<p>Even with rules meant to minimize crosstalk, the debate — moderated by Bash, anchor and chief political correspondent, and Jake Tapper, anchor and chief Washington correspondent — saw many moments of acrimony.</p>
<p>While Trump had harsh words about Biden’s border policy and Biden blasted his predecessor for appointing Supreme Court justices who overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, they saved their harshest criticism for the other’s personal conduct.</p>
<p>Referring to reports that, as president, Trump said veterans killed in action in France during World War II were “suckers and losers,” Biden, invoked his son, Beau, who was a National Guard veteran and later died of brain cancer.</p>
<p>“My son was not a loser and was not a sucker,” Biden told his predecessor, scowling. “You’re the sucker. You’re the loser.”</p>
<p>Trump denied he ever made the remark, first reported in The Atlantic and confirmed in other reports.</p>
<p>Biden at several times attacked Trump’s credibility and truthfulness, saying after one answer, “Every single thing he said is a lie.”</p>
<p>“I never heard so much malarkey in my whole life,” he said in response to another of Trump’s answers.</p>
<p>Trump brought up the conviction of Biden’s son, Hunter, on federal gun charges this year. And he said that Joe Biden could face prosecution for his performance on border security.</p>
<p>Trump and his legal team <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-floats-return-trial-court-trump-presidential-immunity-case" target="_blank">argued in front of the Supreme Court</a> in April that presidents have absolute immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s conviction</h4>

	
<p>Thursday’s event was the first presidential debate where one participant was a convicted felon.</p>
<p>A New York state jury in May <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">found Trump guilty</a> of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels for an affair she testified they had that Trump didn’t want to harm his 2016 election prospects.</p>
<p>Trump has denied the affair and it hasn’t affected his support within the GOP, though his sentencing July 11 could affect his campaign strategy.</p>
<p>Trump rejected his criminal conviction during the debate and reiterated his stance that he didn’t have a sexual relationship with an adult film star.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have sex with a porn star,” Trump said, marking the first time such words, or anything near them, have been uttered during a presidential debate.</p>
<p>“I did nothing wrong, we have a system that was rigged and disgusting,” Trump said. “I did nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>Trump also responded to the question by referring to Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>“When he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon,” Trump said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jan. 6 disagreement</h4>

	
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court is <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/delayed-supreme-court-ruling-makes-trump-trial-2020-charges-unlikely-election" target="_blank">expected to release a ruling </a>within days in another trial involving Trump, this time on whether presidents enjoy complete immunity from criminal prosecution for their actions while in office.</p>
<p>The justices’ decision will determine whether a federal trial against Trump for election interference stemming from his actions on Jan. 6, 2021 can proceed.</p>
<p>During the debate, Trump said that “on January 6 we were respected all over the world,” but that changed after Biden took office.</p>
<p>Trump seemed to imply that the people who stormed the Capitol building were “innocent” and “patriotic,” saying that “you ought to be ashamed of yourself” for those people being in prison.</p>
<p>Biden said that Trump encouraged the “folks” who attacked the U.S. Capitol building and U.S. Capitol Police officers.</p>
<p>“If they’re convicted, he says he wants to commute their sentences,” Biden said, criticizing Trump’s behavior that day. “These people should be in jail. They should be the ones held accountable.”</p>
<p>Biden rejected the idea that the people who attacked the police and disrupted the electoral certification were patriots.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Divide on abortion rights</h4>

	
<p>Reproductive rights — including access to abortion — sharply divided Biden and Trump, who sparred over which political party’s stance is better.</p>
<p>Trump said that he agreed with the U.S. Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-rejects-attempt-limit-access-abortion-pill-6" target="_blank">decision earlier this month</a> to leave access to mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion, in place. And he said he wouldn’t seek to limit access if elected president in November.</p>
<p>“I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it,” Trump said, adding that the Supreme Court’s earlier decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion was a good thing.</p>
<p>“We brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue,” Trump said. “It’s been a great thing.”</p>
<p>Trump said he supports exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the woman.</p>
<p>Biden rejected Trump’s classification that Democrats are “radical” on abortion policy and said he supports reinstating the protections that existed under Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>“It’s been a terrible thing,” Biden said of leaving decisions about abortion access up to state lawmakers, comparing it to leaving civil rights decisions up to the states.</p>
<p>Trump said during an interview with Time magazine <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-leaves-door-open-banning-medication-abortion-nationwide" target="_blank">released in April </a>that his campaign was on the brink of releasing a policy regarding mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion. The campaign has yet to release that policy.</p>
<p>Trump suggested that he would be okay with states limiting or barring access to contraception during a May interview with a Pittsburgh TV news station. But he quickly <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signals-hes-open-state-limits-contraceptive-access-then-insists-hes-not" target="_blank">walked back those comments</a> in a social media post.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank, has suggested that another Trump administration could block the mailing of mifepristone by enforcing the Comstock Act.</p>
<p>The group included the proposal along with dozens of others in Project 2025, its <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank">920-page blueprint</a> for a second Trump administration.</p>
<p>The 1873 anti-obscenity law <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/1873-law-banned-mailing-boxing-photos-could-it-block-abortion-pills-too" target="_blank">hasn’t been enforced in decades </a>and is referred to as a “zombie law” by reproductive rights organizations, but it is still technically a law.</p>
<p>A future Republican attorney general seeking to enforce the law to block the mailing of mifepristone would likely see the law challenged in court, likely working its way up to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Mifepristone is one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortions, which are approved for up to 10 weeks gestation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The two-drug regimen accounts for about 63% of all abortions within the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">First of two debates</h4>

	
<p>The two presidential debates this year are a departure from past years, with both candidates <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-presidential-debates-one-vp-debate-scheduled-ahead-2024-election" target="_blank">ditching the proposed schedule</a> from the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.</p>
<p>Biden and Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/cnn-sets-first-biden-trump-presidential-debate-june-27-atlanta" target="_blank">later agreed</a> to two debates, the one held Thursday by CNN and another one on Sept. 10 that will be hosted by ABC News.</p>
<p>CNN opted to hold its debate at its studios in Atlanta, Georgia, without an audience. Thursday night’s debate was also earlier than any other presidential debates, which have traditionally begun in September or October.</p>
<p>The television news network created frustration ahead of the debate with the White House Correspondents Association when it decided to keep the pool, the group of journalists that travel everywhere with the president, out of the room.</p>
<p>Kelly O’Donnell, president of the WHCA, released a statement Thursday afternoon that the organization was “deeply concerned that CNN has rejected our repeated requests to include the White House travel pool inside the studio”</p>
<p>“The pool is there for the ‘what ifs?’ in a world where the unexpected does happen,” wrote O’Donnell, who is also the senior White House correspondent for NBC News. “A pool reporter is present to provide context and insight by direct observation and not through the lens of the television production.”</p>
<p>CNN’s rules also said that neither Biden nor Trump was allowed to bring props or pre-written notes into the debate area.</p>
<p>Each stood behind “a uniform podium” and was not allowed to interact with campaign staff during the two commercial breaks.</p>
<p>Biden was scheduled to travel with first lady Jill Biden to Raleigh, North Carolina, immediately after the debate wrapped. They’re set to participate in campaign events on Friday morning before traveling to New York later in the day.</p>
<p>The Bidens are then expected to travel to Red Bank, New Jersey, on Saturday for more campaigning before heading back to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.</p>
<p>Trump will attend a campaign rally Friday afternoon in Chesapeake, Virginia. In a release announcing the event, Trump criticized Biden on inflation, crime and drug addiction, and immigration.</p>

(Photo by Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)</p><p>President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will get a crucial opportunity to reach undecided voters and set the terms for the 2024 presidential campaign at Thursday night’s debate in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Partisans on either side have already made up their minds about which candidate they’ll support. And with this year’s race serving as a rematch of 2020, many Americans have already formed strong and possibly unchangeable opinions about the candidates.</p>
<p>Yet there is a sizable group of voters who haven’t decided who they’ll support in November, Christopher Stout, a professor of political science at Oregon State University, said in an interview with States Newsroom.</p>
<p>“On one hand, opinions about Joe Biden and Donald Trump are baked in,” Stout said. “On the other hand, there’s a lot of people who aren’t paying any attention to politics and this is their first time thinking about the 2024 election.”</p>
<p>For Biden, a major objective will be to show voters the 81-year-old incumbent can be energetic and forceful, Stout and political strategists said.</p>
<p>Trump, 78, may focus on appealing to voters in the ideological middle and wavering Republicans who want a conservative candidate but are turned off by the former president’s antics.</p>
<p>On policy, each candidate has issues they will capitalize on as strengths. Trump will probably press Biden on immigration and inflation, while Biden undoubtedly will be eager to criticize Trump on reproductive rights.</p>
<p>The debate, sponsored by CNN, will be moderated by the network’s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash and begin at 9 p.m. Eastern, with no studio audience. It is set to last for 90 minutes and will air live on CNN with simulcast available for other cable and broadcast networks.</p>
<p>Each candidate’s microphone will be muted while the other is speaking. No props are allowed but each man will be given a pen, pad and bottle of water, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/politics/how-to-watch-cnn-debate/index.html" target="_blank">CNN said.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can Trump be boring?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump could gain ground with moderate and independent voters by appearing steady.</p>
<p>After winning the presidency in 2016, Trump lost to Biden in 2020 amid a sense that Republican-leaning voters were weary of his unorthodox style and tendency to create scandal.</p>
<p>“If he’s boring and he looks like a typical politician, that’s going to be a big plus for him,” Stout said. “If he looks like a typical politician and he seems more moderate, then there’s the opportunity to bring back a set of voters who were once Republican who have now left the party.”</p>
<p>At the same time, there’s likely not too much down side for Trump if he does go off-script, as voters have come to expect outlandish comments and behavior, Republican strategist Doug Heye said.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is gonna say something crazy,” Heye said. “That is all factored in and that’s not changing anybody’s mind.”</p>
<p>Heye cited recent remarks Trump has made about shark attacks, electrocution from oversized batteries and taking his shirt off to reveal psychic wounds inflicted by political opponents.</p>
<p>In a move reminiscent of his reality-show past, Trump has teased a possible announcement of <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/calm-conservative-confident-what-gop-senators-want-trumps-vice-presidential-pick" target="_blank">his vice presidential pick</a> at the debate.</p>
<p>But even if voters expect some degree of eccentricity from Trump, that will not help him win over the undecided voters who will decide the election, said Rodell Mollineau, a co-founder and partner at the Washington-based strategy firm ROKK Solutions and a veteran of Democratic campaigns.</p>
<p>“If you’re actually trying to reach voters, I’m not sure how Trump ranting and raving, talking about delusional conspiracy theories, helps him win independent voters,” Mollineau said.</p>
<p>Trump will face an additional unique challenge if he tries to look like a traditional presidential candidate: his <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">34 felony convictions</a> in New York last month and the three other felony prosecutions against him pending, including two related to his efforts to overturn his loss in the 2020 election that led to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.</p>
<p>“I’m watching to see how he talks about or doesn’t talk about his many court dalliances and the conviction and whatever else he has hanging over his head,” Mollineau said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can Biden be forceful?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden faces different questions he must answer.</p>
<p>Voters have doubts about the incumbent’s ability, due in part to his age, inclination for misspeaking and a concerted effort by Republicans and GOP-aligned media to portray Biden as past his prime.</p>
<p>“I think Biden in part is going to be trying to overcome the image that Trump and Republicans in general have been very successful in creating,” University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said.  “They’ve been working on this now for at least five years, and that is the image of Biden being too old, being not up to it physically or mentally to continue to serve as president for another four years.”</p>
<p>Biden countered that narrative — at least temporarily — with an exuberant performance at <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-warns-freedom-and-democracy-are-under-attack-fierce-state-union-address" target="_blank">the State of the Union address</a> this year, several observers said.</p>
<p>Matching that energy will help him have a positive debate, they said.</p>
<p>But Heye noted that despite rave reviews from Democrats, the president’s State of the Union performance did not improve his standing in polls.</p>
<p>“The reaction from Democrats was: game changer,” Heye said. “And if we look at the polling, the game didn’t change at all.”</p>
<p>Biden would also benefit by reminding voters of his policy record, and contrasting it with Trump’s, Stout and Mollineau said.</p>
<p>“It will advantage him if he can talk about policy,” Stout said. “People don’t know the things he has done and so there’s hope maybe to inform people and sway the electorate.”</p>
<p>Biden should target left-leaning voters by reminding them of his achievements on climate and the environment and his administration’s efforts to create jobs, Stout said.</p>
<p>Mollineau added that Biden must remind voters of Trump’s tumultuous time in office and Biden’s achievements thus far, while balancing that message with an acknowledgment that many Americans are unsatisfied.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An early debate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The debate, which will be broadcast from CNN’s Georgia headquarters, comes much earlier in the election cycle than usual, even before the party conventions that typically symbolize the start of the general election.</p>
<p>The candidates agreed to the unusual schedule after rejecting a proposal from the Commission on Presidential Debates, a nonpartisan organization that has organized the events for decades, typically with three meetings between presidential candidates and one between would-be vice presidents.</p>
<p>All debates are usually in the fall.</p>
<p>This year’s June schedule could give the candidates a chance to frame the race moving forward, as many voters will be tuning in to the contest for the first time.</p>
<p>But the nearly 19 weeks remaining until Election Day could also mean a candidate with a weak performance has time to recover, or that a strong performance could diminish.</p>
<p>“I do not believe anyone is going to either win or lose the election this week,” Mollineau said.</p>
<p>Bullock, the Georgia professor, differed.</p>
<p>Because of the unpopularity of both candidates, and the sense that voters will be choosing the one they view as “the least of two evils,” either could provide a voter’s “final straw,” he said.</p>
<p>“They may hear something coming out of the mouths of one of these and say, ‘Yeah, that’s it,’” Bullock said. “‘That’s the final straw. I can’t support that one. It helps me make up my mind to go with the other person.’”</p>

(Photo Illustration by Mario Tama/Getty Images)</p><p>Nearly three weeks after the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration proposed loosening a federal prohibition on marijuana, the next phases of policy fights over the drug’s status are starting to take shape.</p>
<p>Public comments, which the DEA is accepting on the proposal until mid-July, will likely include an analysis of the economic impact of more lenient federal rules.</p>
<p>Administrative law hearings, a venue for opponents to challenge executive branch decisions, will likely follow, with marijuana’s potential for abuse a possible issue.</p>
<p>Congress, meanwhile, could act on multiple related issues, including banking access for state-legal marijuana businesses and proposals to help communities harmed by the decades of federal prohibition.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, a Democrat from Oregon and longtime advocate for legalizing marijuana who’s retiring at the end of the year, is encouraging his colleagues to build on the administration’s action by taking up bills on those related issues.</p>
<p>The politics of the issue should favor action, even in the face of an upcoming campaign season that typically slows legislative action, Blumenauer said in a May 17 interview, noting the popularity of a more permissive approach to the drug.</p>
<p>“Congress may not do a lot between now and November, but they should,” the 14-term House member said. “Because it’s an election year, there’s no downside to being more aggressive.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economic impact</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/21/2024-11137/schedules-of-controlled-substances-rescheduling-of-marijuana#print" target="_blank">proposed rule</a> published in the Federal Register last month, the DEA specifically asked commenters to weigh in on the economic impacts of moving the drug from Schedule I to the less-restrictive Schedule III list under the federal Controlled Substances Act.</p>
<p>That will likely mean the agency will consider the impact of allowing state-legal marijuana businesses to deduct business expenses from their federal taxes, Mason Tvert, a partner at Denver-based cannabis policy and public affairs firm Strategies 64, said in an interview. Under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/280E" target="_blank">current law</a>, no deductions are allowed.</p>
<p>That issue is seen by advocates, including Blumenauer and f<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-launch-renewed-push-full-marijuana-legalization" target="_blank">ellow Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden</a>, who chairs the tax-writing U.S. Senate Finance Committee, as paramount for the industry.</p>
<p>Thousands of state-legal businesses struggle to earn a profit or operate at a loss under the current system, Blumenauer said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Potential for abuse</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The DEA typically looks at three factors when assessing how strictly to regulate a drug: its medicinal value, potential for abuse relative to other drugs and ability to cause physical addiction.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/d1b41750bb7210f6/63765434-full.pdf" target="_blank">2023 analysis</a> by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that looked at data from states where medicinal marijuana is legal showed that “there exists some credible scientific support for the medical use of marijuana.”</p>
<p>That finding could lead DEA to look at other factors, Tvert said.</p>
<p>“The battleground that we’ll see will be around how we define potential for abuse,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Agencies split?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>But the DEA proposed rule revealed a divided view among government agencies about the drug’s potential harms, Paul Armentano, the deputy director for the longtime leading advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, told States Newsroom.</p>
<p>The text of the proposed rule shows “a lack of consensus” among HHS, the Attorney General’s Office and the Drug Enforcement Administration, he said.</p>
<p>“There are several points in the DEA’s proposed rule where they express a desire to see additional evidence specific to concerns that the agency has about the potential effects of cannabis, particularly as they pertain to abuse potential and potential harms,” Armentano said.</p>
<p>“The HHS addresses those issues, but the DEA essentially says, ‘We’d like to see more information on it.’”</p>
<p>Kevin Sabat, the president and CEO of the anti-legalization group Smart Approaches to Marijuana, agreed that the DEA did not appear to agree with the HHS conclusion that medical uses exist.</p>
<p>The proposed rule “just brings up all these issues with the HHS’s determination and it basically invites comment on all those issues,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Administrative law hearing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Sabat’s group will also be petitioning for a DEA administrative hearing, he said. An administrative law judge could rule that the proposal should not go through or that it should be amended to remain stricter than the initial proposal described.</p>
<p>“We’re going to highlight the fact that, first of all, this does not have approved or accepted medical use,” he said.</p>
<p>Tvert said the accepted medical value question is likely not to be a major factor in an administrative law hearing. Several medical organizations and states that allow medicinal use have already endorsed its medicinal value, he said.</p>
<p>Instead, the focus will turn to the drug’s potential for abuse, he said.</p>
<p>“What will be critical is looking at cannabis relative to other substances that are currently II or III or not on the schedule, and determining whether cannabis should be on Schedule I when alcohol is not even on the schedules and ketamine is Schedule III.”</p>
<p>As of June 6, nearly 12,000 people had commented on the proposal in the 18 days since its publication.</p>
<p>While opinion polls show that most Americans favor liberalizing cannabis laws — a Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/03/26/most-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana-for-medical-recreational-use/#:~:text=Nearly%20six%2Din%2Dten%20Americans,not%20be%20legal%20at%20all." target="_blank">survey in March</a> found 57% of U.S. adults favor full legalization while only 11% say it should be entirely illegal — the public comments so far represent a full spectrum of views on the topic.</p>
<p>“This rule is a horrible idea, this should remain in Schedule I,” one comment read. “Marijuana is a gateway drug and ruins lives.”</p>
<p>“There are no negative side effects to its use,” another commenter, who favored “fully” legalizing the substance, wrote. “Its not harmful. The only harm is what the government has done to me and America. Shame on the people that continue to oppose this. Seriously shame on anyone that would stand in the way of this change.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Congressional action?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Blumenauer authored a memo last month on “the path forward” for reform as the rescheduling process plays out.</p>
<p>He listed four bills for Congress to consider this year.</p>
<p>One, sponsored by House Democrats, would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substance Act schedule entirely and expunge prior offenses.</p>
<p>A bipartisan bill would make changes to the banking laws to allow state-legal businesses greater access to loans and other financial services.</p>
<p>Another, cosponsored with Florida Republican Brian Mast, would allow Veterans Administration health providers to discuss state-legal medicinal marijuana with veteran patients.</p>
<p>Blumenauer has also co-written language for appropriations bills that would prevent the Department of Justice from prosecuting marijuana businesses that are legal under state or tribal law.</p>
<p>“All of these things are overwhelmingly popular, they’re important, we have legislative vehicles and supporters,” he said.</p>
<p>Still, there may be disagreements about what to pursue next.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen disagreements among Democratic supporters of legalization over whether to prioritize banking or criminal justice reforms.</p>
<p>A banking overhaul has much greater bipartisan support, and advocates on all sides of the issue agree it’s the most likely to see congressional action.</p>
<p>But some who support changes to banking laws in principle object to focusing on improving the business environment without first addressing the harms they say prohibition has caused to largely non-white and disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-law-still-treats-marijuana-illegal-drug-creating-headaches-states" target="_blank">recently as 2021</a>, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer described banking reform legislation as too narrow. Sen. Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, called it a “common-sense policy” but said that he favored a more comprehensive approach.</p>
<p>“I’ve gone around with Cory on that,” Blumenauer said. “More than anybody in Congress, I’m in favor of the major reforms, and we’ve been fighting for racial justice and equity … but (racial justice and banking reforms) are not mutually exclusive.”</p>
<p>In September, <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-statement-on-safer-banking-act" target="_blank">Booker agreed</a> to co-sponsor the banking reform bill after winning a promise from Schumer that a separate bill to help expunge criminal records would also receive a vote. Neither measure has actually received a floor vote.</p>
<p>In a statement following the administration’s announcement on rescheduling, Booker praised the move, but called for further action from Congress.</p>
<p>That includes passing a bill he’s sponsored that would decriminalize the drug at the federal level, expunge the records of people convicted of federal marijuana crimes and direct federal funding to communities “most harmed by the failed War on Drugs,” according to <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-schumer-wyden-lead-reintroduction-of-cannabis-administration-and-opportunity-act-legislation-to-end-federal-prohibition-of-cannabis" target="_blank">a summary</a> from Booker’s office.</p>
<p>“We still have a long way to go,” Booker said in the statement on rescheduling. “Thousands of people remain in prisons around the country for marijuana-related crimes. They continue to bear the devastating consequences that come with a criminal history.”</p>
<p>Blumenauer said Congress should act on the proposals that have widespread support from voters.</p>
<p>“This not low-hanging fruit, this is having them pick it up off the ground,” he said. “There is no other controversial issue that has as much bipartisan support that’s awaiting action.”</p>

<p>The Drug Enforcement Administration will propose moving the drug from a Schedule I substance, which also includes heroin and methamphetamine, to Schedule III, which is the category for regulated-but-legal drugs including testosterone and Tylenol with codeine.</p>
<p>“Today, the Attorney General circulated a proposal to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III,” DOJ spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement to States Newsroom. “Once published by the Federal Register, it will initiate a formal rulemaking process as prescribed by Congress in the Controlled Substances Act.”</p>
<p>Cannabis has been listed as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act since 1971, even as many states have moved to legalize recreational use for more than a decade and medicinal use for even longer.</p>
<p>State-legal marijuana businesses make up a multibillion-dollar industry, but the illegal status of the drug under federal law creates barriers unseen by other industries, including a lack of access to banking and the inability to deduct business expenses from taxes.</p>
<p>Social justice advocates have also noted that prosecutions for marijuana-related crimes have hurt communities of color. Many of those convicted for offenses related to marijuana have not benefited from the recent decriminalization in many states.</p>
<p>Moving cannabis to Schedule III would allow a more permissive approach to the drug, including permitting greater study of medicinal uses and allowing related businesses to use a common tax deduction.</p>
<p><strong>Schumer praises development</strong></p>
<p>Congressional leaders on the issue and other advocates of changing marijuana’s status welcomed the news Tuesday afternoon, even as they called for further action.</p>
<p>“It is great news that DEA is finally recognizing that restrictive and Draconian cannabis laws need to change to catch up to what science and the majority of Americans have said loud and clear,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.</p>
<p>The New York Democrat added that other legislation, including bills to provide cannabis businesses with greater access to banking and to completely delist the drug, is still needed.</p>
<p>“Congress must do everything we can to end the federal prohibition on cannabis and address longstanding harms caused by the war on drugs,” he said.</p>
<p>Sen. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat from Colorado who was the state’s governor when it and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational use in 2012, said the news was welcome but did not go far enough.</p>
<p>“Rescheduling marijuana is a step in the right direction. But – just a step,” he posted to X. “Marijuana should be DEscheduled altogether.”</p>
<p>The state’s current Gov. Jared Polis, also a Democrat, cheered the move in a written statement.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled by the Biden Administration’s decision to begin the process of finally rescheduling cannabis, following the lead of Colorado and 37 other states that have already legalized it for medical or adult use, correcting decades of outdated federal policy,” Polis said.</p>
<p>“This action is good for Colorado businesses and our economy, it will improve public safety, and will support a more just and equitable system for all.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Cannabis Council, a business group, applauded the expected change.</p>
<p>The move was based on U.S. Department of Health and Human Services research and would have myriad benefits for business, Executive Director Edward Conklin said in a written statement.</p>
<p>The update would put marijuana on a path to full legalization and make it easier for state-legal businesses to run profitable operations, he said.</p>
<p>“Moving to Schedule III represents a tectonic shift in our nation’s drug laws. The US Cannabis Council is committed to ending federal cannabis prohibition, and we believe that reclassification is a necessary and critical step toward that goal,” he wrote. “In the coming days, we will submit comments to the DEA in support of the proposed rule.”</p>

(Photo by Patrick Donovan/Getty Photos)</p><p>Key members of Congress announced an agreement Monday on a $105 billion bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration for five years ahead of a May 10 deadline.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/faa_reauthorization_act_of_2024.pdf" target="_blank">1,000-page bill</a> would raise hiring targets for air traffic control and would codify in law <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/feds-require-airlines-automatically-refund-passengers-canceled-or-delayed-flights" target="_blank">a rule the Biden administration introduced</a> this month requiring airlines to offer refunds for canceled or significantly delayed flights, among other consumer-focused provisions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/faa_reauth_act_section_by_section.pdf?utm_campaign=197793-345" target="_blank">legislation</a> also would add flights to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, despite opposition from U.S. senators from Virginia and Maryland who said in a letter Monday the move would hurt safety efforts.</p>
<p>The compromise measure was negotiated by U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Chair Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, and ranking Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Chair Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, and ranking Democrat Rick Larsen, a Washington Democrat.</p>
<p>The four lawmakers released <a href="https://transportation.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=407408" target="_blank">a joint statement</a> announcing the agreement early Monday praising their “bipartisan, bicameral, comprehensive agreement.”</p>
<p>“The American people deserve nothing less than the safest and most efficient aerospace system in the world, and to that end, our bill provides critical safety enhancements, grows America’s aviation workforce, invests in infrastructure at airports of all sizes, sets clear priorities for advancing innovative aviation solutions, improves the flying public’s travel experience, and ensures a healthy general aviation sector for years to come,” the lawmakers said.</p>
<p>The bill would authorize $66.7 billion to fund key safety programs such as aircraft safety certification and the hiring of air traffic controllers and technical engineers. It would also authorize $19.35 billion for infrastructure improvements. It would more than double annual funding for the Essential Air Service program that subsidizes flights to small rural airports.</p>
<p>No votes have been scheduled in either chamber on the measure, which President Joe Biden must sign by midnight on May 10 to avoid a lapse in FAA authority.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Washington National Airport</h4>

	
<p>With endorsements from committee leaders on both sides of the aisle, the bill should have broad bipartisan appeal in both chambers of Congress.</p>
<p>But senators from the states bordering Washington, D.C., said Monday they opposed the provision adding five incoming and five outgoing flights to Washington’s Reagan National Airport, or DCA, located in Northern Virginia just across the Potomac River.</p>
<p>In a statement, Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia and Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland vowed to “continue to fight against this ridiculous and dangerous provision.”</p>
<p>Two planes cleared to take off from the busy airport <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2024/04/19/faa-investigating-near-miss-reagan-national/" target="_blank">came within 400 feet of crashing</a> in an April 18 incident. The near-miss should have underscored the crowded conditions at DCA, which, as the closest airport to the Capitol, is a favorite of members of Congress, the senators wrote.</p>
<p>Committee members, none of whom are from the area, “decided to ignore the flashing red warning light of the recent near collision of two aircraft at DCA and jam even more flights onto the busiest runway in America,” the senators said. “It should go without saying that the safety of the traveling public should be a higher priority than the convenience of a few lawmakers who want direct flights home from their preferred airport.”</p>
<p>Because the federal government owns DCA and Dulles International Airport further into the Northern Virginia suburbs, Congress has the power to make operational changes.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Consumer provisions</h4>

	
<p>The bill includes several provisions meant to protect consumers.</p>
<p>It would establish in law a rule the Biden administration proposed this month to require airlines to offer cash refunds for flight delays of more than three hours for domestic flights or six hours for international travel.</p>
<p>The Biden administration had sought such a measure, even as it pursued the rule.</p>
<p>It would also require airline credits to be effective for at least five years, bar airlines from charging families to sit together and require the Transportation Department to create a digital dashboard of the minimum seat sizes for U.S. airlines. It does not mandate a national standard for seat size, but it does direct the FAA to decide if a rule on the issue is needed.</p>
<p>The legislation would establish a Senate-confirmed position of deputy secretary for consumer protection, who would run a new office with an annual budget of $14 million dedicated to consumer issues.</p>

United States was argued inside. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court appeared skeptical Thursday of former President Donald Trump’s argument he is immune from criminal charges that he tried to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>But conservatives who dominate the court appeared open to returning key questions to a trial court, possibly delaying Trump’s prosecution beyond the November election — and essentially assisting the former president as he fights legal challenges on multiple fronts.</p>
<p>Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has argued in a federal trial court and in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia that his actions following the 2020 election and leading up to the violent Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, were “official acts” conducted while still in office and therefore are not subject to criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>While court precedent establishes that U.S. presidents are immune to civil damages for their official acts, and to criminal prosecution while in office, the justices now must decide the unanswered question of whether former presidents are absolutely immune from criminal law.</p>
<p>At oral arguments Thursday in Trump v. United States, much of the discussion centered on what should be considered an official presidential act.</p>
<p>Several conservative justices suggested that lower courts work to determine what aspects of the charges against Trump arose solely from his private conduct.</p>
<p>Such a detour could eat up additional weeks or months as the trial calendar converges with Election Day.</p>
<p>A decision from the court may not arrive until late June or early July. If a ruling calls for additional fact-finding at the trial court level, Trump’s election interference trial likely would not happen prior to the November election.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyer, D. John Sauer, of St. Louis, argued that nearly everything a president does in office — including hypotheticals about ordering a military coup or assassinating a political rival — could be considered official acts.</p>
<p>While much of the court appeared skeptical of that broad view of official acts, several justices on the conservative wing asked about having the trial court determine what acts should be considered official. They also suggested prosecutors could drop sections of the four-count indictment against Trump that dealt with official acts.</p>
<p>The court’s three liberal justices voiced serious concerns about Trump’s immunity argument, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wondering aloud if the court accepting a broad view of criminal immunity for the president would make the Oval Office “the seat of criminal activity.”</p>
<p>The case is one of four in state and federal courts in which criminal charges have been made against Trump. On Thursday, he was in a New York state courtroom where he <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ny-prosecutor-ties-trump-hush-money-payments-campaign-criminal-trial-kicks" target="_blank">faces charges</a> in an ongoing hush-money trial; the judge there did not allow him to attend the Supreme Court arguments.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trial court determination</h4>

	
<p>Conservative justices asked if they could avoid the constitutional question by having the trial court, presided over by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, determine which parts of the allegations could be considered official or unofficial acts.</p>
<p>Special counsel Jack Smith and his team of prosecutors have indicated that prosecuting only Trump’s private conduct would be sufficient, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said.</p>
<p>“The normal process, what Mr. Sauer asked, would be for us to remand if we decided that there were some official acts immunity, and to let that be sorted out below,” Barrett said, referring to a process in which a case is sent back to a lower court. “It is another option for the special counsel to just proceed based on the private conduct and drop the official conduct.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Absolute immunity’</h4>

	
<p>Sauer argued, as <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-gop-led-states-argue-presidential-immunity-claim-supreme-court" target="_blank">he has</a> <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-makes-one-last-presidential-immunity-argument-us-supreme-court" target="_blank">for months</a>, for “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution for presidents acting in their official capacity.</p>
<p>No president who has not been impeached and removed from office can be prosecuted for official actions, Sauer said, broadly interpreting the meaning of official acts.</p>
<p>Liberal justices questioned Sauer about how far his definition of official acts would stretch. Trump’s attorney was reluctant to list any exceptions.</p>
<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked a hypothetical that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-federal-panel-grills-trump-lawyer-claim-presidential-immunity" target="_blank">arose</a> in a lower court: Would it be an official act for the president to order the assassination of a political rival?</p>
<p>“That could well be an official act,” Sauer answered.</p>
<p>He also answered Justice Elena Kagan that it could be an official act for a president to order a military coup, though Sauer said “it would depend on the circumstances.”</p>
<p>Michael R. Dreeben, representing the U.S. Department of Justice, argued that Trump’s broad view of presidential immunity would break a fundamental element of U.S. democracy, that no one is above the law.</p>
<p>“His novel theory would immunize former presidents for criminal liability for bribery, treason, sedition, murder, and here, conspiring to use fraud to overturn the results of an election and perpetuate himself in power,” Dreeben said.</p>
<p>Jackson, questioning Sauer, appeared to agree with that argument.</p>
<p>She said Sauer appeared worried that the president would be “chilled” by potential criminal prosecution, but she said there would be “a really significant opposite problem if the president wasn’t chilled.”</p>
<p>“Once we say, ‘No criminal liability, Mr. President, you can do whatever you want,’ I’m worried that we would have a worse problem than the problem of the president feeling constrained to follow the law while he’s in office,” Jackson said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A special, peculiarly precarious position’</h4>

	
<p>But other members of the court appeared more amenable to Sauer’s argument that subjecting presidents to criminal prosecution would constrain them.</p>
<p>Justice Samuel Alito, one of the court’s conservatives, asked Dreeben about Trump’s argument that a president’s duties require a broad view of immunity.</p>
<p>The president has to make difficult decisions, sometimes in areas of law that are unsettled, Alito said.</p>
<p>“I understand you to say, ‘If he makes a mistake, he makes a mistake, he’s subject to the criminal laws just like anybody else,’” Alito said. “You don’t think he’s in a special, peculiarly precarious position?”</p>
<p>Dreeben answered that the president has access to highly qualified legal advice and that making a mistake is not what generally leads to criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>He also noted that the allegations against Trump involve him going beyond his powers as president to interfere with the certification of an election, which is not a presidential power in the Constitution.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Incumbents leaving office</h4>

	
<p>Alito, who seemed to be the justice most sympathetic to Trump’s argument that allowing a president to be prosecuted would undermine the powers of the office, also raised the prospect that incumbents who lose elections may seek to illegally stay in power precisely because prosecution would await after they leave office.</p>
<p>“A stable democratic society requires that a candidate who loses an election, even a close one, even a hotly contested one, leave office peacefully,” he said.</p>
<p>“If an incumbent who loses a very close, hotly contested election, knows that a real possibility after leaving office is … the president may be criminally prosecuted by a bitter political opponent, will that not lead us into a cycle that destabilizes the functioning of our country as a democracy?”</p>
<p>Dreeben answered that “it’s exactly the opposite,” because there are well-established lawful options, including court challenges, available to challenge election results.</p>
<p>Trump posted several times Thursday morning on his social media platform Truth Social that the president would “have no power at all” without absolute immunity.</p>
<p>“That would be the end of the Presidency, and our Country, as we know it, and is just one of the many Traps there would be for a President without Presidential Immunity. Obama, Bush, and soon, Crooked Joe Biden, would all be in BIG TROUBLE,” he wrote.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Writing a rule for the ages’</h4>

	
<p>Some justices indicated they will be thinking beyond the question as it relates to Trump’s election interference charges, possibly hinting at a drawn-out process in issuing an opinion.</p>
<p>Criminally prosecuting a former president could open the door to prosecution based on motives, including the motive to get reelected or for other personal gain, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch suggested.</p>
<p>“I’m not concerned about this case, but I am concerned about future uses of the criminal law to target political opponents based on accusations about their motives,” Gorsuch said in a lengthy back-and-forth with Dreeben.</p>
<p>“I’m going to say something that I don’t normally say, which is: That’s really not involved in this case,” Dreeben said, eliciting a laugh from Gorsuch.</p>
<p>“I understand that. I appreciate that. But you also appreciate that we’re writing a rule for the ages,” Gorsuch responded.</p>
<p>At another point, Dreeben tried to redirect the justices to specific details of the Trump case, including his point that the judicial system has safeguards against purely politically motivated and retaliatory legal action.</p>
<p>Dreeben attempted to detail for Alito that the Justice Department functioned “in the way that it is supposed to” when Trump’s alleged plan to ask officials to send fraudulent letters to states regarding election results failed.</p>
<p>Alito pushed back, saying he wanted to discuss the case “in the abstract.”</p>
<p>“I understand that Mr. Dreeben. But as I said, this case will have effects that go far beyond this particular prosecution,” Alito said.</p>
<p>Alan Morrison, a law professor at George Washington University who has argued 20 cases before the Supreme Court, said in a phone interview after oral arguments that the court will not reach “a fast decision” as the justices wrestle with the extent of what is considered a president’s official acts.</p>
<p>“Neither side is going to get everything they want,” Morrison said. “And the hardest questions to answer are going to be what are official and what are not official acts.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Reacting against a monarch’</h4>

	
<p>Sticking to the specifics of the indictment against Trump, Kagan ran through a list of the allegations and asked Sauer to discern what constituted an official act.</p>
<p>“The defendant asked the Arizona House Speaker to call the legislature into session to hold a hearing based on their claims of election fraud,” Kagan said, citing the indictment.</p>
<p>“Absolutely an official act for the president to communicate with state officials on a matter of enormous federal interest and concern,” Sauer answered, “attempting to defend the integrity of a federal election to communicate with state officials and urge them to view what he views as their job under state law and federal law.”</p>
<p>Kagan moved to hypotheticals and asked if a president who ordered a military coup, but was never impeached and convicted by Congress, could not be held to U.S. criminal law.</p>
<p>“He was the president. He is the commander in chief. He talks to his generals all the time, and he told the generals, ‘I don’t feel like leaving office. I want to stage a coup.’ Is that immune?”</p>
<p>“If it’s an official act, there needs to be impeachment and conviction beforehand,” Sauer said, citing the defense’s reliance on the Constitution’s Impeachment Clause argument.</p>
<p>“That is the wisdom of the (Constitution’s) framers,” he added.</p>
<p>“The framers did not put an immunity clause into the Constitution,” she quickly responded. “… They didn’t provide immunity to the president, and you know, not so surprising. They were reacting against a monarch who claimed to be above the law.”</p>
<p>“Wasn’t the whole point that the president was not a monarch and the president was not supposed to be above the law?” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal election interference charges</h4>

	
<p>A federal grand jury <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">charged</a> Trump with four felony counts in August 2023 for working with several co-conspirators to overturn election results in seven states.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">indictment</a> charged the former president with conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of an official proceeding, among other charges.</p>
<p>Trump allegedly worked with several others to replace legitimate electors with fraudulent ones in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>The prosecution also alleges that he tried to leverage the Justice Department to pressure the states to replace their slates of electors, and pressure Vice President Mike Pence into altering results during Congress’s joint session to certify the results on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p>The Biden administration will send close to $1 billion to airports across the country to upgrade terminal facilities, including $41 million to Dulles International Airport and Norfolk International Airport in Virginia, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg announced Thursday.</p>
<p>The $970 million in grants will go to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_30KisDYNQ7o0Y2LUEYBcwPp6QEpbdmFBCmEjix0P_M/edit#gid=1481791103" target="_blank">144 airports in 44 states</a> and three territories. Earmarked for terminal improvements, the grants will fund projects to improve the passenger experience and create jobs, Buttigieg and other administration officials said.</p>
<p>“Part of that better travel experience is to invest in our physical infrastructure to improve the airports that represent the beginning and end of every passenger’s journey and airports that are a key economic engine for workers who show up there every day and communities that rely on those airports to sustain their connectedness and their competitiveness,” Buttigieg said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The grants will fund a variety of projects, ranging from building new terminals or concourses to making bathrooms bigger, improving baggage systems and security screening areas, expanding public transit options, building solar energy infrastructure and increasing accessibility, Buttigieg said.</p>
<p>“This funding is real,” said Shannetta Griffin, the Federal Aviation Administration’s deputy administrator for airports. “We are changing lives.”</p>
<p>In Virginia, $35 million will go toward the construction of a new 14-gate, 400,000 square foot terminal at Dulles International Airport.</p>
<p>“Dulles Airport is a beacon for both domestic and international flights, and has expanded rapidly over the past decade,” said U.S. Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner in a statement. “This funding will improve travel for passengers and ensure that the airport stays functional and safe while continuing to meet flight demands.”</p>
<p>An additional $6 million will go toward the construction of a new Federal Inspection Service facility to process cargo and agricultural products at Norfolk International Airport.</p>
<p>Buttigieg and Griffin briefed reporters on the grant selections on the condition their comments not be made public until Thursday.</p>
<p>The FAA received more than 600 applications for grants asking for a total of $14 billion, Griffin said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Infrastructure law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The funding is authorized by the infrastructure law enacted in 2021. The grant selections this week represent the third round of roughly $1 billion of annual grant funding under the program. The law’s airport terminal program provides $5 billion over 5 years.</p>
<p>The total costs for the projects selected this year are more than $10.3 billion, meaning the grants announced Thursday cover an average of about 9.4% of total project costs.</p>
<p>Separate funding is available for aviation operations. The infrastructure law provides $25 billion in funding for airports, including the terminal grants.</p>
<p>Buttigieg highlighted grants to small airports in Appleton, Wisconsin, and on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation that spans portions of North Dakota and South Dakota.</p>
<p>The Appleton International Airport will receive $3.4 million for a $78 million overhaul that includes adding four gates, updating buildings and improving access.</p>
<p>The Standing Rock Airport will receive $700,000 out of $800,000 needed to build a new terminal building near Fort Yates, North Dakota. The general aviation airport, used for recreation and medical emergencies, does not have a terminal.</p>
<p>The largest grant in this year’s selections will go to Fort Lauderdale International Airport in Florida. A $50 million grant will be put toward a $221 million terminal connector.</p>
<p>Large grants will also go to major hubs, including $40 million for Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, $36 million for the Phoenix airport, the $35 million for Dulles in Northern Virginia and $26.6 million for Denver’s airport.</p>
<p>Buttigieg will be in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Thursday to announce a $27 million grant for that city’s airport to replace passenger boarding bridges.</p>

Circuit Court on his claim of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. (Screenshot from C-SPAN)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump appeared in federal court Tuesday seeking immunity from charges that he schemed to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and knowingly fed lies to supporters who turned violent on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Trump, who is leading polls in the 2024 Republican presidential primary field, watched while his attorney D. John Sauer was grilled by a panel of judges as he argued that the former president is shielded from criminal prosecution because he acted in an official capacity. Trump in a brief press conference later suggested a ruling against his immunity claim would spur “bedlam” from his supporters.</p>
<p>The former president arrived at the courtroom minutes before the proceedings with his team of lawyers and sat mostly expressionless, taking no notes, while Sauer answered questions from a three-judge all-female panel, according to reporters inside the courtroom. Dozens of other journalists watched a live feed from a media room for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse.</p>
<p>Presiding Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, Florence Y. Pan and J. Michelle Childs fired question after question to Sauer for roughly 40 minutes as he argued that Trump’s acts leading up to and on Jan. 6 were “official” and that his eventual acquittal by the U.S. Senate protects him from double jeopardy.</p>
<p>Trump was impeached by the U.S. House for inciting an insurrection on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>The decision by the appeals judges — Henderson, appointed under President George H. W. Bush, and the others recent President Joe Biden appointees — is likely to land in the U.S. Supreme Court, where a ruling could have significant implications for presidential liability.</p>
<p>Under questioning, Sauer told the appeals panel that “to authorize the prosecution of a president for his official acts would open a Pandora’s box (from) which this nation may never recover.”</p>
<p>The judges questioned whether a president’s actions while in office, no matter the legality, would be immune from criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>“You’re saying a president could sell pardons, could sell military secrets, could order SEAL Team Six to assassinate a political rival,” Pan said to Sauer.</p>
<p>Sauer conceded that selling military secrets “strikes me as something that might not be held to be an official act.”</p>
<p>Pan replied that Sauer’s concession undermines the Trump team’s argument that the government’s separation of powers guarantees the judiciary cannot hold the executive branch accountable.</p>
<p>“Given that you’re conceding that presidents can be criminally prosecuted under certain circumstances, doesn’t that narrow the issues before us to ‘Can a president be prosecuted without first being impeached and convicted?’” Pan said.</p>
<p>“Your separation of powers argument falls away, your policy arguments fall away if you concede that a president can be criminally prosecuted under some circumstances,” Pan said.</p>
<p>Henderson, questioning whether Trump’s actions can be defended as official acts, said, “I think it’s paradoxical to say that his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed allows him to violate (federal law).”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Government’s case</h4>

	
<p>Arguing for the U.S. Department of Justice, Assistant Special Counsel James Pearce described the potential for an “awfully scary” and “frightening” future if presidents could be completely immune from criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Pearce rebuffed the notion that “floodgates” would open for cases against presidents.</p>
<p>“This investigation doesn’t reflect that we are going to see a sea change of vindictive tit for tat prosecutions in the future. I think it reflects the fundamentally unprecedented nature of the criminal charges here,” Pearce said.</p>
<p>Trump could be seen shaking his head in disagreement at the comment, according to reporters in the room.</p>
<p>“If as I understood my friend on the other side is to say here, a president orders his SEAL team to assassinate a political rival and resigns, for example, before an impeachment, (it’s) not a criminal act. I think that’s an extraordinarily frightening future,” Pearce said during his roughly 20 minutes of questioning.</p>
<p>In his five-minute rebuttal, Sauer said a United States in which a president is “very, very, very seldom prosecuted because they have to be impeached and convicted first is the one we’ve lived under for 235 years. That’s not a frightening future, that’s our republic.”</p>
<p>Sauer said the criminal charges against Trump are now creating “a situation where we have the prosecution of the political opponent who’s leading in every poll in the presidential election next year and is being prosecuted by the administration that he’s seeking to replace.”</p>
<p>The three-judge panel concluded oral arguments after an hour and 15 minutes and did not indicate when judges would release a decision.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump calls for immunity, warns of ‘bedlam‘</h4>

	
<p>In brief remarks following the hearing at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Washington, which was a Trump-branded property until his business sold the lease in 2022, Trump said presidents should have legal immunity, proclaimed his innocence and hinted his supporters would create more unrest if he were prosecuted.</p>
<p>Biden was using federal prosecutions to damage his chief rival politically, Trump said.</p>
<p>“This is the way they’re going to try to win,” he said. “And that’s not the way it goes. There’ll be bedlam in the country. It’s a very bad thing, it’s a very bad precedent. As we’ve said, it’s the opening of a Pandora’s box. It’s a very sad thing that’s happened with this whole situation.</p>
<p>“When they talk about threat to democracy, that’s your real threat to democracy and I feel that as a president, you have to have immunity,” Trump added.</p>
<p>The remarks drew on a strategy <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-legal-problems-abound-first-test-2024-presidential-campaign-nears-iowa" target="_blank">the Trump campaign has employed</a> for months to use the former president’s myriad legal troubles to boost his electoral standing by framing him as a victim of political persecution.</p>
<p>Trump suggested that he was being prosecuted for official acts related to curbing voter fraud and repeated debunked claims that the 2020 election was decided by fraudulent votes.</p>
<p>“I did nothing wrong, absolutely nothing wrong,” he added. “I’m working for the country.”</p>
<p>Trump spoke for just more than seven minutes and did not take questions.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump indictment</h4>

	
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan in December <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258148/gov.uscourts.dcd.258148.171.0_1.pdf" target="_blank">denied</a> Trump’s motion to dismiss his case based on presidential immunity.</p>
<p>U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to immediately take the case, bypassing the appeals level, but the justices <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-wont-yet-rule-presidential-immunity-question-trump-case" target="_blank">declined</a>.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">indicted</a> Trump in August for interfering in election results following the November 2020 presidential contest.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_2.pdf" target="_blank">indictment</a> accuses Trump of conspiring with attorneys, a U.S. Department of Justice official and a political consultant, all unnamed, to organize fake electors for Trump from seven key states that Biden in fact won. Those states included Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The indictment also outlined Trump’s pressure campaign on former Vice President Mike Pence to reject electors from those states during his ceremonial role of certifying the election results on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>Leading up to that date, the indictment recounts, Trump knowingly fed a stream of lies to his supporters that he won the election, igniting a rally during which he spoke on Jan. 6, 2021 and culminating in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. The official four charges against Trump include conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; obstruction of, and attempt to obstruct, an official proceeding; and conspiracy against rights.</p>

<p>A Federal Bureau of Investigation official testifying before a U.S. House panel on Tuesday questioned the process that led to the Biden administration choosing a Maryland location for a new bureau headquarters instead of a competing site in Virginia.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration rejected an advisory panel’s recommendation for a site in Springfield, Virginia, when<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maryland-confirmed-pick-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank"> it chose to plan a new FBI facility</a> in Greenbelt, Maryland, said Nicholas Dimos, the assistant director of the FBI’s Finance and Facilities Division.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zlX27rNOo2"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/15/virginia-members-of-congress-ask-for-investigation-into-site-pick-for-new-fbi-headquarters/">Virginia members of Congress ask for investigation into site pick for new FBI headquarters</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia members of Congress ask for investigation into site pick for new FBI headquarters&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/15/virginia-members-of-congress-ask-for-investigation-into-site-pick-for-new-fbi-headquarters/embed/#?secret=6i9WfmNfpw#?secret=zlX27rNOo2" data-secret="zlX27rNOo2" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Dimos said the bureau was “surprised” to learn the GSA’s site selection authority for the project, Nina Albert, departed from an advisory panel’s findings and chose the Maryland site that benefited her prior employer — the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which owns the Greenbelt site. The agency operates transit in the District of Columbia and its suburbs, including bus and rail.</p>
<p>The recommendation from the panel of two GSA designees and one FBI designee was nonbinding — and the GSA was authorized to depart from it — but it was unusual, Dimos said. His comments came during a hearing by the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management.</p>
<p>“Within the FBI’s procurement shop, this is exceedingly rare,” he said.</p>
<p>A subsequent FBI review of the GSA decision showed further issues, including that the GSA prioritized certain measures in a way that was inconsistent with a previously published site selection plan, and that the GSA used “outside information” to inform the decision, Dimos said.</p>
<p>Those changes “repeatedly benefited the Greenbelt site and disadvantaged the Springfield site,” he said.</p>
<p>“The site selection plan gave (Albert) authority to come to a different conclusion than the panel,” Dimos said. “But the consistent, one-directional nature of the changes favoring Greenbelt caused concerns for the FBI.”</p>
<p>Albert was invited to testify at the hearing but declined, subcommittee Chairman Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican, said. Albert is now acting deputy mayor for Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Perry said that the panel may escalate efforts to compel her testimony.</p>
<p>“We will be sending her a letter to continue to seek the answers we need,” he said. “And we’ll have to consider other options available to the subcommittee so that we can hear her perspective in the future, which will be very important to getting to the bottom of this issue.”</p>
<p>Elliot Doomes, the commissioner for public buildings service at the GSA, stood by the agency’s decision, praising the Maryland site’s access to transit and the certainty associated with the costs and timeline of its construction.</p>
<p>He denied that the agency’s process was biased for Greenbelt.</p>
<p>“The site selection authority did not make changes in favor of a specific site,” Doomes said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Battle between states</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Dimos, Doomes and several lawmakers on the panel agreed on the need for a new FBI headquarters — though Perry said he didn’t necessarily agree — citing the condition of the current J. Edgar Hoover Building between the White House and U.S. Capitol in the center of Washington.</p>
<p>The building is in disrepair and its urban location poses security risks, they said.</p>
<p>“The status quo is a drain on taxpayer dollars to sustain a failing … facility that doesn’t meet the needs of our workforce or mission,” Dimos said.</p>
<p>“It is a counterintelligence disaster just waiting to happen,” subcommittee ranking Democrat Dina Titus of Nevada said. “And, as such, is a threat to our national security.”</p>
<p>A long-running process to find a new headquarters in the Washington region for the FBI has caused years of ill will between lawmakers representing the District of Columbia’s neighboring states.</p>
<p>The announcement last month that the GSA had chosen the Maryland site caused <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-urged-hold-fbi-hq-move-maryland-while-review-continues" target="_blank">an outcry among the Virginia delegation</a>. Marylanders have <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/11/10/hoyer-on-fbi-hq-decision-this-is-a-done-deal/" target="_blank">strongly defended it.</a></p>
<p>The GSA’s inspector general said in <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/a/2/a27db5c7-ef2f-42d2-a6e5-5d6de18e414e/12685CFA0AED8209BB165E7A5C99D1E7.gsa-ig-reply-to-sen.warner-re-fbi-site-concerns.pdf" target="_blank">a Nov. 30 letter</a> that his office would launch an evaluation of the decision-making process, spurred by <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/investigation-launched-site-selection-process-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank">concerns raised by Virginia Sen. Mark Warner.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Decision questioned</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Perry, a member of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, said Tuesday the decision appeared political.</p>
<p>“The American people smell a rat here,” Perry said. “We’ve got to get to the bottom of what happened here, because this does not fulfill the FBI’s mission.”</p>
<p>Much of the skepticism from both parties Tuesday came from the divergence between the selection of Greenbelt and the advisory panel’s recommendation.</p>
<p>Asked by full committee ranking Democrat Rick Larsen of Washington how often the GSA departs from an advisory panel’s finding, Doomes said the agency doesn’t keep a comprehensive database but that “it’s happened a couple of times in the last 25 years.”</p>
<p>Doomes added that to this knowledge, those instances didn’t trigger an inspector general evaluation, as the FBI decision has.</p>
<p>Doomes said the Greenbelt site’s easy access to transit and cost certainty “reflect new government-wide directives and provide better taxpayer value.”</p>
<p>“Greenbelt provides the best access to transportation and is the most transit-accessible,” he said. “It provides the government with the greatest project schedule certainty, offers the greatest opportunity to positively impact the Washington, D.C., region and has the lowest overall cost to taxpayers of all the three sites.”</p>
<p>The Springfield site has a warehouse and a “classified tenant” that would have to be moved before construction on an FBI facility could start, adding to the cost and timeline uncertainty if the government continued with that site, Doomes said.</p>
<p>Dimos, who agreed on the need for a new facility, said the FBI would prefer a site closer to downtown Washington to be more convenient to meet with the U.S. Justice Department and other partners outside of the bureau.</p>
<p>Perry criticized the selection criteria that included advancing equity and sustainability. Those criteria were set by Congress in a 2022 spending bill, but Perry said they should be removed.</p>
<p>“What we should be focused on here is the mission of the FBI and what best enhances that,” he said. “This is on Congress, but not one of these sites … services the mission of the FBI.”</p>

The balloon incident prompted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to cancel a planned visit to Beijing, China.

<p>Jean-Pierre opened Thursday’s press briefing with a statement on the shootings, saying President Joe Biden stepped out of a state dinner Wednesday night to receive an initial briefing on the event. Biden and first lady Jill Biden were “praying for the victims and their families” and “for those still fighting for their lives,” Jean-Pierre said.</p>
<p>Such violence devastated families and communities and left survivors “both physically and mentally scarred,” she said. She ticked through a list of policies Congress could enact to reduce future violence: banning assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, requiring universal background checks and requiring safe storage of guns.</p>
<p>Biden signed a bipartisan gun safety bill last year, which was narrower than an earlier Democratic proposal. He also established a White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, headed by Vice President Kamala Harris, last month.</p>
<p>But such steps were insufficient, Jean-Pierre said.</p>
<p>“While we have made progress since the president signed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act into law, much more — much more — must be done,” she said. “The president has been clear that executive action alone is just not enough.”</p>
<p>The White House office would evaluate what further executive actions could be taken, Jean-Pierre said. But the bulk of the responsibility fell to Congress, she said.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do everything that we can from here, but really the answer is Congress has to act,” she said. “They have to take action.”</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre declined to answer a question about Biden potentially visiting Lewiston in the aftermath of the shootings. The first priority should be to arrest a suspect, she said.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans Tuesday voted to tap Minnesota’s Tom Emmer as speaker following five rounds of ballots — but Emmer quit the race just four hours later, after he was attacked by the GOP’s most powerful figure, former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>After beating six candidates, Emmer, the No. 3 Republican, faced an uphill battle to coalesce more than 20 hard-right Republican holdouts loyal to Trump, who took to social media shortly after the vote to warn that electing Emmer would be a “tragic mistake.”</p>
<p>“He never respected the Power of a Trump Endorsement, or the breadth and scope of MAGA,” Trump, also a 2024 candidate for president, wrote about Emmer on his site, Truth Social. “He is totally out-of-touch with Republican Voters.”</p>
<p>Emmer, 62, who represents a safe GOP district that includes parts of the western and northern Twin Cities suburbs, the city of St. Cloud and rural areas in between, had continued to meet with holdouts on Tuesday afternoon following the closed-door conference vote.</p>
<p>Emmer quickly left the meeting later Tuesday, dogging reporters chasing after him. He declined to comment before entering a black car. Lawmkers said he dropped out a short time later.</p>
<p>With Emmer out, Republicans will have to begin their nomination process anew and it was unclear how that would proceed.</p>
<p>Emmer would have had to get nearly all of the 221 Republican votes on the House floor, as all Democrats are expected to vote for Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. In the final secret ballot, Emmer earned 117 GOP votes, a long way from the 217 needed for the speaker’s gavel if all Republicans are present and voting.</p>
<p>In a roll call conference vote, again behind closed doors, on whether a member would support him on the floor, Emmer’s support grew to 186, according to several lawmakers in the meeting.</p>
<p>Several Republicans leaving Tuesday’s meeting, such as Reps. Steve Womack of Arkansas and Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, acknowledged that Emmer did not have the votes needed to become speaker, but still remained hopeful that Emmer could narrow that gap.</p>
<p>Womack said that because the conference had a roll call ballot, Emmer can see which Republicans were holdouts.</p>
<p>“I expect that Tom would want to meet with the individuals that are not calling his name and see if there is something he can say or do that could bring them around and help shore up their requisite 217,” Womack said. “If he can’t do that, then he’s got to make a decision as to whether he goes to the floor.”</p>
<p>Womack added that there are some members that will always be against Emmer, but he did not name them.</p>
<p>“What I just saw in that room illustrates to me that there are some people that are pretty well dug in and are not going to support the current designee,” he said.</p>
<p>For example, Georgia’s Rick Allen, had already stated he will never vote for Emmer because the Minnesota Republican voted<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022513" target="_blank"> to codify same-sex marriage, according to CNN.</a></p>
<p>Johnson said that Emmer was working on flipping those holdouts.</p>
<p>“People with concerns are coming forward, and he’s taking them head on,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>When asked how many members voted against Emmer in the roll call vote, Mike Waltz of Florida said “too many.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Third GOP nominee</h4>

	
<p>Emmer was the third Republican nominee for speaker.</p>
<p>The first, Louisiana’s Steve Scalise <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">never brought his nomination for a floor vote</a> and the second, Ohio’s Jim Jordan, was <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/10/20/jim-jordan-again-rejected-in-bid-for-u-s-house-speaker-and-gop-struggles-to-regroup/" target="_blank">tossed aside</a> by the party after his third and final unsuccessful floor vote for the speaker’s gavel.</p>
<p>The House has been without a speaker for 21 days.</p>
<p>Emmer, who serves in GOP leadership as the Republican whip, had the endorsement of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, but would have had to court members and allies of the far-right House Freedom Caucus who are aligned closely with Trump.</p>
<p>On Monday, Emmer posted a video in which he said he has always “gotten along” with Trump, who is also the current GOP front-runner in the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>In a Monday campaign stop in New Hampshire, Trump was asked if he’d endorse Emmer. The former president said he’d “always gotten along with” Emmer, but said he was trying to allow House Republicans to choose their own leader.</p>
<p>Emmer posted <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1716536001819017487" target="_blank">a video clip of the appearance to X</a>, saying as speaker, he would continue the pair’s “strong working relationship.”</p>
<p>However, by Tuesday, Trump had posted about his opposition to Emmer on his social media site.</p>
<p>Emmer was also one of the few candidates running for the speakership who voted to certify the 2020 election results.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The speaker campaign</h4>

	
<p>On Monday night, as they tried again to elect a speaker, House Republicans heard pitches from eight of their colleagues who had filed by a Sunday deadline. Pennsylvania’s Dan Meuser was also a candidate but dropped out in the middle of the <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/u-s-house-republicans-mull-eight-new-candidates-for-speaker-in-advance-of-votes/" target="_blank">closed-door candidate forum</a>.</p>
<p>Those GOP <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2023/10/23/nine-republicans-are-running-for-u-s-house-speaker-heres-your-guide-to-the-field/" target="_blank">lawmakers who ran</a> for the speaker’s gavel included Reps. <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/10/23/alabama-congressman-gary-palmer-to-run-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Gary Palmer of Alabama</a>, <a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2023/10/20/floridas-byron-donalds-is-now-a-candidate-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Byron Donalds of Florida</a>, Austin Scott of Georgia, <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/10/21/another-louisiana-republican-joins-u-s-house-speaker-fray/" target="_blank">Mike Johnson of Louisiana</a>, <a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/10/21/rep-bergman-says-his-hat-is-in-the-ring-for-u-s-house-speaker/" target="_blank">Jack Bergman of Michigan</a>, Kevin Hern of Oklahoma and Pete Sessions of Texas.</p>
<p>Early Tuesday, Scalise, the House majority leader, said the goal is for Republicans to unify behind a nominee and get back to legislative work that has been stalled since McCarthy was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">ousted earlier this month. </a></p>
<p>“There’s a lot of work to do,” Scalise said. “All of these things are bills that are ready to go that we want to move.”</p>
<p>Whoever becomes speaker will be tasked with a quickly approaching <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/09/30/ditching-ukraine-aid-u-s-house-in-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-to-avert-shutdown/" target="_blank">Nov. 17 deadline for government funding</a> and a nearly <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/10/20/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request/" target="_blank">$106 billion supplemental aid request</a> from the White House for Ukraine, Israel and global aid and U.S. border security. Emmer will also have to lead in moving must-pass legislation such as the <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/08/01/massive-defense-bill-approved-by-u-s-senate-but-deep-partisan-divide-with-house-looms/" target="_blank">annual defense bill</a> and five-year <a href="https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2023/10/09/farm-bill-stalled-amid-u-s-house-speaker-battle-delay-of-spending-bills/" target="_blank">reauthorization of the farm bill</a>.</p>
<p>On top of legislative duties the new speaker will have to balance striking deals with a White House and Senate controlled by Democrats while also fundraising and protecting vulnerable Republicans and expanding the House’s slim GOP majority in the 2024 elections.</p>
<p>McCarthy said he wants to see the party move beyond its deep fractures and that there must be “consequences” for the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to oust him.</p>
<p>“It’s frustrating because it’s just a few, these eight, working with all the Democrats to ruin the reputation of the Republicans, but we’ll earn it back,” the California Republican said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Five ballots for Emmer</h4>

	
<p>Republicans went through five secret ballots on Tuesday to get to a nominee. Some candidates withdrew their names prior to voting to speed the process along, such as <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/10/24/gary-palmer-withdraws-from-u-s-house-speaker-race/" target="_blank">Palmer</a> and Meuser.</p>
<p>Sessions was dropped in the first round of ballots; Bergman in the second round; Scott in the third round; Hern in the fourth round; and Johnson in the fifth round. Donalds withdrew in the fourth round.</p>
<p>Because Republicans have struggled to rally behind one candidate, Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska asked all speaker candidates and GOP lawmakers to sign a unity pledge.</p>
<p>But there were clear signs of dissent.</p>
<p>For the first four rounds of secret ballots, six lawmakers voted either present or for others besides the announced candidates, stirring concern that a candidate may not be able to gain the support of the majority of the conference on the floor.</p>
<p>Bill Huizenga of Michigan said as the final ballot was ongoing, he had a message for those Republicans who voted present: “We got to figure this out. Stop voting present, stop voting for other people. We have two candidates.”</p>
<p>One of those who voted present, Troy Nehls of Texas, said that Emmer had no chance of becoming speaker and that as Republicans, “we are, again, back to where we started.”</p>
<p>Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky said Emmer asked the holdouts to remain in the room after an up-or-down roll call vote to discuss differences.</p>
<p>“So when I left, several people who voted different than Emmer were at the microphone,” he said.</p>
<p>Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri said she hoped Emmer’s approach would rebuild trust among the conference.</p>
<p>“This is really good because it also does away with this feeling that there are any kind of backroom deals going on or that people are, you know, getting their wish lists,” Wagner said, referring to one-on-one meetings that other speaker candidates have held.</p>
<p>In January, McCarthy made a secret handshake deal with far right conservatives before he won on a 15th ballot.</p>
<p>Mario Díaz-Balart of Florida said that while Donalds was his first choice, he wanted to unify around Emmer whom he described as “honorable.”</p>
<p>As whip “he has the relationships. If he can’t pull it together then we’re running into some very, very difficult times,” he said.</p>
<p>House Democrats continued to criticize the GOP Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Chaos and dysfunction continue to be the order of the day in the House Republican majority. Today is day 21 without a speaker, and the other side is back to square one,” Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said at a press conference.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Emmer finances, fundraising</h4>

	
<p>Known in Congress as a promoter of cryptocurrency, Emmer’s own finances are remarkably traditional, according to personal financial reports required of members of Congress.</p>
<p>In his most recent annual report, filed in May, Emmer listed only one asset, an investment account worth between $15,000 and $50,000, and one liability, a mortgage of between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>
<p>He listed no stock holdings, transactions, gifts or other finances — a rarity for congressional financial disclosures that are<a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/02/07/tuberville-among-four-in-alabama-congressional-delegation-to-invest-in-corporate-stocks/" target="_blank"> often</a><a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2023/07/11/manchin-earned-476k-in-2022-from-family-coal-company-congressional-disclosures-show/" target="_blank"> more</a><a href="https://mainemorningstar.com/2023/09/19/maines-u-s-senators-among-stock-holding-members-of-congress-financial-disclosures-show/" target="_blank"> complicated</a>.</p>
<p>A prolific fundraiser as the former head of the House Republican campaign operation, Emmer has raised millions from the cryptocurrency sector and promoted the technology in the House, where he sits on the Financial Services Committee.</p>
<p>He raised $2 million for the National Republican Congressional Committee in the 2022 cycle from the political action committee of Ryan Salame, the former co-CEO of FTX, a crypto firm that went bankrupt after serious allegations of fraud.</p>
<p>Immediately following that scandal, Emmer<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ftx-failure-divides-lawmakers-how-tough-get-crypto-regulation" target="_blank"> maintained</a> that the FTX example should not undermine the promise of cryptocurrency itself.</p>
<p>For the current campaign cycle, Emmer has raised a combined $3.7 million for his own campaign and for his leadership PAC. He’s raised $230,000 from contributors in the securities and investment industry — more than any industry other than “retired,” according to the nonprofit campaign spending tracking group Open Secrets.</p>

</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON – The eight Republican candidates to be speaker of the U.S. House were set to make their cases to their colleagues Monday evening as the House Republican Conference restarted its process to choose a candidate.</p>
<p>Nine had filed on Sunday to run for speaker, but on Monday night Pennsylvania Rep. Dan Meuser dropped out, after announcing just the day before he would make a bid for the post. Meuser cited his promise to run former President Donald Trump’s campaign in Pennsylvania as one of the reasons he exited the race.</p>
<p>The chamber has been in turmoil since eight Republicans voted with all House Democrats to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy from the post last month. The conference has been unable to unite behind a single candidate.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZsCN3Kr7Wc"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/03/u-s-house-votes-to-remove-kevin-mccarthy-as-speaker/">U.S. House votes to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After Monday night’s speeches, the conference was expected to hold a vote or likely multiple votes behind closed doors Tuesday to try to settle on a nominee, then bring that nominee to the floor.</p>
<p>With the exception of Minnesota’s Tom Emmer, the House majority whip, the group is not particularly well known outside of their districts.</p>
<p>Six of the eight voted to object to certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, in line with Trump’s position.</p>
<p>With Republicans holding only a 221-212 majority, any would-be speaker will need near-unanimous support from Republicans — a tall order for a deeply divided conference largely still loyal to the former president, but with some members in vulnerable seats.</p>
<p>“It’s a nearly impossible task,” Peter Loge, a professor at the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, told States Newsroom. “Because you have to be as conservative and angry and election-denying as Matt Gaetz, but as reasonable and a believer in compromise and democratic institutions as the New York moderates. And you can’t be both at the same time.”</p>
<p>In hopes that Republicans will rally around whoever the party nominates this time, Rep. Mike Flood of Nebraska introduced a “<a href="https://flood.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-flood-launches-unity-pledge-speakers-race" target="_blank">unity pledge</a>” for members to sign. As of Monday afternoon, eight of the nine original candidates — all but Gary Palmer of Alabama — have signed the pledge, according to Flood’s office.</p>
<p>“Everyone running for Speaker should sign this,” Michigan Republican Jack Bergman, one of the contenders, <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJackBergman/status/1715529170271309938" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>.</p>
<p>Loge said the field can be divided into long-term members with institutionalist tendencies — Emmer and Texas’ Pete Sessions, for example — and newer members such as Florida’s Byron Donalds, who are more in line with the conference’s anti-establishment wing.</p>
<p>The next speaker will immediately face a challenge in passing spending bills or a short-term funding measure to keep the government open past a Nov. 17 deadline, as well as an aid package to Israel and Ukraine amid ongoing wars and a farm bill reauthorization.</p>
<p>States Newsroom put together the guide below to help readers get to know the candidates:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jack Bergman of Michigan</h4>

	</strong></p>

<p>First elected in 2020, Donalds, 44, is the youngest to join the field and has been in the House for the shortest time.</p>
<p>He has said his priorities would be to improve border security and “responsibly” pass funding bills.</p>
<p>He sits on the Financial Services Committee. Before coming to Congress, he worked in the finance industry.</p>
<p>The only non-white Republican candidate for speaker, Donalds would be the first Black speaker.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tom Emmer of Minnesota</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Currently the No. 3 House Republican, Emmer is considered by some the <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/10/23/handicapping-u-s-rep-tom-emmers-chances-to-become-the-next-speaker/" target="_blank">frontrunner</a> for the top spot and has McCarthy’s endorsement.</p>
<p>In an appearance on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” on Sunday, McCarthy praised Emmer’s experience as part of his leadership team.</p>
<p>“He sets himself, head and shoulders, above all those others who want to run,” McCarthy said.</p>
<p>Emmer also developed relationships across the conference when he chaired the House Republican campaign operation in the 2020 and 2022 cycles.</p>
<p>Emmer is one of only two candidates for speaker who voted consistently to certify the 2020 election results. That could make his path harder with the most fervent Trump supporters in the House GOP.</p>
<p>Emmer <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1716536001819017487?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" target="_blank">posted a video</a> of Trump on Monday saying that he had “always gotten along” with Emmer and saying he would stay out of the speaker race.

<p>The chair of the conservative House Republican Study Committee, Hern could seek support from budget hawks.</p>
<p>The Institute for Legislative Analysis, a limited-government group, gave Hern the highest marks of any candidate for fiscal and tax issues.</p>
<p>Hern has not been shy about his leadership aspirations. He publicly weighed a run for speaker shortly after McCarthy stepped down, but opted not to join that race. He <a href="https://twitter.com/repkevinhern/status/1631785840316674050" target="_blank">has said</a> he at one time dreamed of being an astronaut.</p>
<p>In a letter to colleagues, Hern said Congress has not run well for decades, citing the number of unauthorized programs and a lack of regular order for spending bills. He also listed illegal immigration and drug overdose deaths as problems that Congress should address.</p>
<p>Hern won a special election for his House seat in 2018. Hern owns several McDonald’s franchises in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The stunning ouster of U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday — the first time a speaker has been removed in Congress’ 234-year history — created a leadership vacuum in the chamber and left multiple questions about how legislative business would proceed.</p>
<p>North Carolina Republican Patrick McHenry ascended to the role of speaker pro tempore following the vote to unseat McCarthy. McHenry’s rise occurred under a House rule created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that allowed McCarthy to secretly choose a temporary successor in advance, in the event the speaker’s office was vacated.</p>
<p>The rule seems designed to keep the chamber running without an elected speaker, but in an institution governed largely by precedent, the unprecedented nature of the situation provoked a buzz of uncertainty, speculation and opinion in D.C. on the day after McCarthy’s unwilling exit.</p>
<p>“The only thing I’m certain about is that anyone who says that they have any certainty on this is lying,” said Josh Chafetz, a professor of law and politics at Georgetown Law. “There’s absolutely no precedents on any of this because this hasn’t happened before.”</p>
<p>Members were exasperated. “The House of Representatives is effectively frozen,” Rep. Garret Graves, a Louisiana Republican and McCarthy ally, told reporters Wednesday. “We’re not able to actually advance legislation. We can’t even refer bills to committee.”</p>
<p>McHenry has called for House members to vote on the next speaker on Oct. 11. Until then, the House is unlikely to try to conduct business — even as a government funding deadline approaches Nov. 17. But there’s also the possibility that the House won’t — or is unable to — choose a speaker for even longer.</p>
<p>Here are some questions about how the chamber moves forward in the absence of an elected speaker, with answers from legal and congressional experts.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why does the role of speaker pro tempore exist in the U.S. House of Representatives, and what powers does that person hold?</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p>Molly E. Reynolds, senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, said Wednesday during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlhKzpLLLxQ" target="_blank">panel discussion</a> the role of speaker pro tempore was designed as a way to bolster continuity of government.</p>
<p>“The language of the rule itself isn’t entirely clear on what powers the speaker pro tem has — whether it’s all of the powers of the Office of the Speaker, or just authorities that allow him to effectuate a new election for speaker,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>There are two schools of thought about how much power a speaker pro tempore holds, Reynolds said.</p>
<p>“I would put myself in the camp that the speaker pro tem, McHenry, has the full powers of the speakership with the possible exception of sitting in the line of succession,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>“My logic there is that given how this rule was originally designed, which was to allow someone to act as speaker in the event of a real crisis, that you would not necessarily have wanted to develop a rule that would limit that person’s power in an actual emergency,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Other experts agreed with that view.</p>
<p>“The idea behind a pro tempore is: The person can act in the absence of a speaker,” Jason Roberts, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina, told States Newsroom. “So I interpret that to mean the speaker pro tempore can do basically whatever they choose to do.”</p>
<p>Nearly every move McHenry makes would become a precedent for future temporary speakers, Roberts said.</p>
<p>Tests to McHenry’s power could end up being settled by a majority of the House, experts said.</p>
<p>“The way that precedents in the House work when things are unprecedented is when someone does something, that becomes a precedent,” Roberts said. “If someone is unhappy with what they did, they can raise a point of order… And then the House would vote on that, and if they sustain the point of order then that would become the precedent.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How is McHenry approaching the job?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>For the time being, McHenry is taking the more restrained approach to his authority as the temporary speaker of the House. He has not yet referred bills to committee or scheduled floor votes on any legislation, Reynolds said.</p>
<p>But that could change if Republicans cannot quickly elect another speaker.</p>
<p>“This is all pretty untested and it may well be the case that McHenry’s choice to act in this more limited way is a political one,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Because this has never happened before, anything McHenry does during the days or weeks to come could be used as precedent in the future if the House ever needs to lean on another speaker pro tempore, Reynolds said.</p>
<p>“In the kind of situation that this rule originally anticipated — a true catastrophic emergency — I think we would probably want the person acting as speaker pro tem to have more expansive powers than McHenry is at least planning at this moment to exercise,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Steven S. Smith, a professor at Arizona State University, said that if a leadership vacuum persists past next week, McHenry may have to consider a more robust approach.</p>
<p>“If no new speaker manages to get elected that quickly and he remains the speaker pro tem, then I’m guessing that he’ll have to start thinking about exercising the real powers of the speakership,” Smith said.</p>
<p>Though a temporary speaker could — possibly — use many of the official powers of the office, McHenry lacks some of the power speakers typically enjoy as the leader of the House.</p>
<p>McHenry would lack the power to appoint Rules Committee members, for example, which is what allows a speaker to control the House floor and makes the position as powerful as it is, Smith said.</p>
<p>“If McHenry ends up being, say, a medium-term speaker pro tem, it’s going to be somewhat awkward because none of the Rules Committee members owe their presence there to him,” Smith said. “And he’s not empowered to do anything about it under the conference rules.”</p>
<p>McHenry would also lack the power to appoint members to the steering committee, which makes appointments to every committee in the House, Smith said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What exactly does the rule say?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The official <a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules118.house.gov/files/documents/Rules%20and%20Resources/118-House-Rules-Clerk.pdf" target="_blank">rules of the House</a> detail what the chamber should do if the speaker becomes ill for a long period of time, or if the office is vacated.</p>
<p>Section 8(b)(3)(A) of Rule I states: “In the case of a vacancy in the Office of Speaker, the next Member on the list described in subdivision (B) shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore. Pending such election the Member acting as Speaker pro tempore may exercise such authorities of the Office of the Speaker as may be necessary and appropriate to that end.”</p>
<p>What is “necessary and appropriate to that end” is the part that leads to some debate among experts.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What can the House do without a speaker? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The speaker pro tempore position was intended to allow the House to continue to function as normal, even without an elected speaker.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;U.S. House votes to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/03/u-s-house-votes-to-remove-kevin-mccarthy-as-speaker/embed/#?secret=IE81tymijg#?secret=T3GrEgrl8D" data-secret="T3GrEgrl8D" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>In practice, though, at least in the short term, it’s a major disruption to House business.</p>
<p>Graves blasted Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican who led the challenge to McCarthy, saying he undermined conservative goals and stripped powers from the Republican office.</p>
<p>“You can’t offer subpoenas, you can’t go after Hunter Biden, you can’t go after any of the controversies that this administration has carried out,” Graves said.</p>
<p>Experts said it was unclear how subpoena power could be affected.</p>
<p>If McHenry becomes more assertive as an acting speaker during a prolonged period without an elected one, the House itself would ultimately decide the extent of that position’s power.</p>
<p>“The most fundamental thing about the House is a majority of the House can do anything the majority wants to do,” Roberts said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can House committees meet for hearings or to report bills to the floor?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Nothing but political considerations would prevent committees from meeting, Smith said.</p>
<p>Committees’ authorities, organized under a rules package approved at the beginning of this Congress and in effect even after McCarthy’s ouster, “don’t change at all,” Roberts said.</p>
<p>“I can’t think of any reason why committees couldn’t meet,” Chafetz said. “Committees don’t need the permission of the speaker to hold a meeting.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can the House change the rules that allowed for McCarthy’s ouster?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The House can change its rules at any time, through a majority vote on the floor, Smith said.</p>
<p>McCarthy agreed to a rule change allowing any single member to bring a motion to vacate, the procedure that Gaetz used to trigger the speaker’s fall.</p>
<p>With that in mind, McCarthy’s successor may seek to add a minimum number of members who must sign on to such a motion.</p>
<p>Though rules packages are usually only passed at the beginning of a two-year Congress, a majority can choose to change them at any time.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What about the line of succession?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The House speaker is second in the line of succession to the presidency, behind only the vice president.</p>
<p>With that office vacant, the president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, currently Washington Democrat Patty Murray, would move up to second in line, Roberts said. Murray holds the position by virtue of being the most senior member of the Senate’s majority party.</p>
<p>While McHenry could exercise most of the speaker’s powers within the House, he is not technically the speaker for the purposes of succession.</p>
<p>“Officially, the speaker’s office is vacant,” Roberts said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Does the vote to remove McCarthy as speaker increase the odds of a government shutdown or spending cuts?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Reynolds from Brookings said one of the challenges for the next GOP speaker will be when and how to make trade-offs with the hard-right members of the conference or the centrists, who are most at risk of losing reelection next year.</p>
<p>“If you try to pass an appropriations bill that is embraced by those on the right end of the conference, you’re going to lose votes from the left end of the conference,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>“So it’s a much different political struggle to manage those differences in the conference,” Reynolds said. “And that’s not going to go away for whoever is the next speaker of the House, and in some ways the stakes of all of this are going to get higher the longer we go into the fiscal year.”</p>
<p>A provision in the debt limit law that President Joe Biden and McCarthy brokered in May would institute a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/1-cut-federal-spending-debt-limit-law-its-complicated" target="_blank">1% across-the-board spending cut</a> to defense and domestic discretionary programs next year if Congress cannot pass all 12 of the annual spending bills before the spring.</p>
<p>That provision wouldn’t have any real-world effects until April 30, though if any of the bills aren’t law before then, all of the departments and agencies would be forced to cut spending.</p>
<p>The “Sword of Damocles” provision, as Reynolds called it, will likely galvanize defense hawks in the House and Senate to broker agreement on all the bills before that deadline.</p>
<p>“But one thing that we should take away from this episode, is that if we think what Kevin McCarthy did over the weekend was the right thing, that does not necessarily save him, or any future speaker, from punishment from a dissident faction of his own conference, even though ultimately it may be the right choice for the government and for the country,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Matthew Green, professor of politics at Catholic University of America, said the next Republican speaker will likely have a brief time to broker bipartisan agreements without facing the same motion to vacate that McCarthy did.</p>
<p>“I think there is probably a small window for the next speaker to be able to get things through, even if that requires cooperating with the Democrats and the president — which it almost certainly will — that it won’t necessarily end their speakership,” Green said.</p>
<p>Another challenge for House Republicans is that dealing with the speakership race eats up precious time they need to pass spending bills, Smith said. A new speaker won’t take office until Oct. 11 at the earliest.</p>
<p>“Taking out about 25% of the remaining days before the CR expires is going to put Republicans in a pinch,” Smith said, referring to the continuing resolution that funds the government through Nov. 17.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How did the House Republican Conference get here, and what does it mean for the future?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Green, of Catholic University of America, said that changes in the GOP’s goals over time have partially led to what happened this week when eight members were able to oust a speaker who was backed by more than 210 of his Republican colleagues.</p>
<p>The trend can be traced back to former Speaker Newt Gingrich, and leaders before him, who Green said began shifting the goals to having power, having a majority and communicating. The central goal, he said, wasn’t always legislating.</p>
<p>“That objective and that way of viewing one’s political career gets certain folks elected, who may have genuine views and beliefs and political preferences — but they also don’t see Congress as a place to solve problems and legislate,” Green said. “And that’s in many ways why we are where we are today.”</p>
<p>Philip Wallach, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said sometimes House Republicans “get distracted from the fact that they are members of a legislature that ultimately has to pass laws with majorities of two chambers and get the signature of the president.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How does kicking McCarthy out as speaker affect House Republicans’ fundraising prospects heading into the 2024 elections?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Kevin R. Kosar, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the eight Republicans who voted to remove McCarthy might have created long-lasting problems for House GOP fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>“He was a tremendous fundraiser. He raised gobs and gobs of money for his party, just as Pelosi had done. That’s one of the duties of the modern speaker, is to be this sort of a cash cow,” Kosar said.</p>
<p>“The GOP dissidents just killed that cash cow,” Kosar added. “And I wonder inside the GOP conference, how many members are seething about that because many of them are heavily reliant on the speaker to raise money for them.”</p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — A sweeping government shutdown appeared inevitable on Friday, with the U.S. Senate stuck in a procedural holding pattern on its bipartisan stopgap bill and divided U.S. House Republicans unable to pass their short-term spending bill.</p>
<p>Both chambers of Congress must approve and President Joe Biden must sign government funding legislation before midnight on Saturday, otherwise a funding lapse would begin on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>But mid-afternoon Friday, a month-long funding <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-118hr5525ih/pdf/BILLS-118hr5525ih.pdf" target="_blank">bill</a> packed with steep spending cuts drafted by some of the more conservative members of the House GOP <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023511?Page=2" target="_blank">failed</a> to pass, 198-232. Twenty-one Republican members opposed it. The measure would have had no future in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p>
<p>House leaders following that vote announced they will be in session and voting on Saturday, though on what was not immediately clear ahead of a GOP conference meeting in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>The mood lagged in the U.S. Capitol on Friday, where workers and law enforcement chatted in the hallways and cafeterias about the prospect of working without pay.</p>

<p>More than 3.5 million federal employees <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/disaster-nears-millions-federal-workers-paychecks-would-be-hold-shutdown" target="_blank">would either work without pay or be furloughed</a> if the government shuts down. Federal employees would receive back pay after the shutdown ends, though that provision has not extended to federal contractors in the past.</p>
<p>U.S. troops, roughly 1.3 million people, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/active-duty-military-would-work-without-pay-shutdown-white-house-warns" target="_blank">would be required to work without pay </a>until the shutdown ends.</p>
<p>A partial government shutdown wouldn’t have broad impacts on so-called mandatory spending programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, because those accounts are not predominantly funded through the annual appropriations process.</p>
<p>A shutdown would have varying effects on the dozens of departments and agencies that do rely on Congress to approve new spending bills each year.</p>
<p>Those include the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs. Almost all services for veterans would continue, however.</p>
<p>Other activities were affected as well by the looming shutdown — former President Jimmy Carter’s 99th birthday party at the Carter Center in Atlanta was <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/09/29/with-shutdown-looming-celebration-for-jimmy-carters-99th-birthday-starts-early/" target="_blank">moved up </a>to Saturday instead of Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Border security and spending cuts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During debate on the failed GOP bill, Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan said the legislation would fund the government, cut spending and “secure the border.” GOP lawmakers attached a border security bill they passed earlier this year to the short-term funding bill.</p>
<p>“Three simple, common sense things, but the most important of those three is … the border situation,” Jordan said.</p>
<p>Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the stopgap spending bill would be a “gift basket to far-right extremists” that will “slingshot” the federal government into a shutdown.</p>
<p>“The gutting cuts in this bill do not continue current funding like we’ve historically done in continuing resolutions,” she said. “Instead, this so-called CR slashes cancer and Alzheimer’s research, defunds the police, undercuts allies like Israel and Ukraine.”</p>
<p>House Republicans’ stopgap spending bill would have cut funding below current levels, resulting in billions less available for federal departments and agencies. The departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs would have been exempted from those cuts.</p>

<p>White House budget director Shalanda Young argued during a Friday briefing that Speaker Kevin McCarthy should stick to the spending deal <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default" target="_blank">he and the president brokered </a>in May.</p>
<p>“The speaker wanted to set toplines, we set them,” Young said.</p>
<p>Young criticized House Republicans for not agreeing to the Senate stopgap bill that would last through Nov. 17 to give lawmakers more time to come to an agreement to pass the 12 appropriations bills into law.</p>
<p>“This is not hard,” Young said. “It is not meant to come back and negotiate and redo things we just agreed to do three months ago. It is to keep the government open to give congressional negotiators more time on long-term bills.”</p>
<p>McCarthy, a California Republican, said during a press conference before the House vote that he would likely keep trying to pass a short-term funding bill ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline.</p>
<p>“You have watched me time and again — have you ever known me to quit after one time if it doesn’t succeed?” McCarthy said. “I don’t stop.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate working on stopgap</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Senate <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-moves-short-term-spending-bill-struggle-avoid-shutdown-days-away" target="_blank">released a broadly bipartisan stopgap spending bill</a> earlier this week and has since taken two procedural votes to advance the measure.</p>
<p>But that chamber’s rules don’t allow the Senate to vote on final passage before the Saturday midnight deadline without the consent of all 100 lawmakers.</p>
<p>Kentucky’s GOP Sen. Rand Paul has said he won’t allow a vote as long as the $6.1 billion in additional aid for Ukraine is in the legislation. But party leaders in the Senate aren’t seriously considering removing the Ukraine money.</p>
<p>And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the senior GOP senator from Kentucky, warned against forcing a government shutdown Thursday, saying it would be “an actively harmful proposition.”</p>
<p>“Instead of producing any meaningful policy outcomes, it would actually take the important progress being made on a number of key issues and drag it backward,” McConnell said.</p>
<p>Republican senators are trying to draft an amendment to the stopgap bill that would increase spending on border security and make policy changes, a move they hope would encourage House GOP leaders to put the bill on the floor.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Friday that everything was still “up in the air,” but that he was “hopeful” senators would work out an agreement before the deadline.</p>
<p>“I still think there’s something that can get through here before the deadline tomorrow night,” Thune said. “What exactly it looks like, I think, is still not totally resolved.”</p>
<p>Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun said following a closed-door meeting Friday afternoon that “nothing’s really coming together” because there are “too many moving parts at this stage.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t clear if there would be enough GOP support for the bipartisan Senate CR to move past a procedural hurdle Saturday that requires at least 60 votes, Braun said.</p>
<p>“It looks like probably what’s going to have to happen is something with clarity is going to have to come out of the House,” Braun said. “And I don’t know what that would be, because there was a vote that just didn’t work.”</p>
<p>The stalemate, he said, is at the “worst point” since he’s been a senator.</p>
<p>Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt said senators want to make sure whatever they vote on is “compatible” with their House Republican colleagues.</p>
<p>“So we’ll see what they come up with in the morning. In the meantime, we’re going to continue to work on these measures,” Britt said. “We want to be prepared.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veterans health, WIC, SNAP, parks</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Among agencies, the Department of Veterans Affairs would be largely exempt from the impacts since the VA is funded in advance, a rare exception to how Congress typically handles federal funding for so-called discretionary programs, which make up about one-third of annual federal spending.</p>
<p>The VA says that about 15,620 of its 450,000 employees would be furloughed during a shutdown and several of its programs would be put on hold, including the education call center or GI Bill hotline, career outreach and permanent headstone installations at veterans’ cemeteries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-wont-affect-health-care-or-most-benefits-veterans-va-says" target="_blank">Veterans would continue receiving</a> health care as well as education and pension benefits.</p>
<p>Almost 7 million people within the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also called WIC, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/food-benefits-low-income-families-risk-government-shutdown" target="_blank">could lose access to the program</a> during a partial government shutdown.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="o0rTp58c4g"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/25/food-benefits-for-low-income-families-at-risk-in-a-government-shutdown-white-house-says/">Over 127K Virginians could lose WIC benefits in government shutdown, White House says</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Over 127K Virginians could lose WIC benefits in government shutdown, White House says&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/25/food-benefits-for-low-income-families-at-risk-in-a-government-shutdown-white-house-says/embed/#?secret=6JzGeXXKYb#?secret=o0rTp58c4g" data-secret="o0rTp58c4g" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Monday that the “vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and elimination of those benefits, which means the nutrition assistance that’s provided would not be available.”</p>
<p>Vilsack, a former Iowa governor, said that the USDA has a contingency fund for WIC, but that it would only last a day or two.</p>
<p>He added that another nutrition program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, has enough funding to last the month of October in the event of a government shutdown. There are about 40 million low-income people who rely on SNAP.</p>
<p>“Now, if the shutdown were to extend longer than that, there would be some serious consequences to SNAP,” Vilsack also said on Monday.</p>
<p>Vilsack added that amid a partial government shutdown, it will be <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/09/27/the-farm-bill-is-on-the-verge-of-expiring-congress-is-months-away-from-a-new-version/" target="_blank">nearly impossible for Congress to pass a new farm bill.</a> Every five years, lawmakers must write a sweeping farm bill to set policy and funding levels for farm, food, nutrition and conservation programs.</p>
<p>This year’s farm bill is set to expire Sept. 30, but lawmakers typically finish it by the end of the year. The 2018 farm bill was signed into law in December of that year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nearly-all-national-park-sites-close-during-government-shutdown" target="_blank">National Park officials would need to close off access</a> to most of the country’s 425 parks, recreation areas and national historic sites during a shutdown.</p>

<p>The IRS would continue processing certain payments, maintaining its computer networks and printing and designing tax forms for the upcoming year. However, some taxpayer services will <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/IRS-FY24LapsePlan.pdf" target="_blank">cease</a> during the non-filing season. Call sites that respond to taxpayer questions will be closed during a funding lapse.</p>
<p>Several sources of federal aid to states will also be affected, Tim Storey, the CEO of the National Conference of State Legislatures, said in a written statement Friday.</p>
<p>“A shutdown creates uncertainty for states and impedes access to vital federal programs,” Storey said. “While states may not feel the immediate effects, critical state services that receive federal funding such as (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), disaster relief efforts, cybersecurity and child nutrition may be put in jeopardy if Congress does not come to an agreement quickly.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Road projects on track</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Most federal funding for highways and transit, including the daily reimbursements to state departments of transportation and transit agencies, will continue without interruption.</p>
<p>Those programs are funded through the Highway Trust Fund, not annual appropriations. The trust fund was reauthorized in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The law also provided five years of advanced appropriations for highway and transit spending, meaning that the workers at the U.S. Department of Transportation who process those payments can remain at work with pay through a partial shutdown.</p>
<p>That means federal money for construction of roads, bridges and transit would continue to flow to state coffers.</p>
<p>“If it’s a highway or mass transit project everybody should be at work and fully funded and able to do all of the things on Oct. 2 that they were able to do on Sept. 29,” Jeff Davis, a senior fellow at the national transportation think tank Eno Center for Transportation, said on a Friday webinar.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Air turbulence ahead</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Air travel, meanwhile, could see disruptions.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers, considered essential to protect life and safety, would be required to work without pay.</p>
<p>Federal employees were <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/2023_GSA_Payroll_Calendar-R1pdf.pdf" target="_blank">scheduled</a> to receive a regular paycheck Friday, before a potential partial shutdown. The first paycheck they miss would be Oct. 13, if the partial shutdown is still ongoing then.</p>
<p>If a funding lapse persists that long, the air traffic controllers could begin work slowdowns, leading to air travel delays and cancellations.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers are forbidden by law from striking, but the last partial shutdown saw several <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/ten-air-traffic-controllers-shutdown/index.html" target="_blank">call in sick</a> rather than work without pay.</p>

<p>“Imagine the pressure that a controller is already under every time they take their position at work,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a Sept. 27 news conference. “And then imagine the added stress of coming to that job from a household with a family that can no longer count on that paycheck.”</p>
<p>In addition to hurting morale in the short-term, a shutdown would ruin training programs for air traffic controllers, Buttigieg said.</p>
<p>“We would immediately have to stop training new air traffic controllers and furlough another 1,000 controllers who are already in the training pipeline,” he said. “The complexity of the hiring and training process means even a shutdown lasting a few days could mean we will not hit our staffing and hiring targets next year.”</p>
<p>Other employees that would be required to work during the partial government shutdown include those in the Transportation Security Administration under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Of the nearly 61,000 TSA employees, the agency expects nearly 58,000 to continue security checks across the nation’s airports.</p>
<p>In addition to funding lapses for most federal programs, the authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration expires at midnight Saturday, meaning that the trust funds that operate outside the normal appropriations process could not fund operations as they do for highways.</p>
<p>Even a short-term funding bill without an FAA extension is in practice the same as not having a short-term bill, Davis said.</p>
<p>“The budget authority is not available because the underlying trust fund from which it’s drawn doesn’t exist at the moment,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parks to shutter</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Almost all National Park Service sites that they are physically able to block access to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nearly-all-national-park-sites-close-during-government-shutdown" target="_blank">would close</a>.</p>
<p>“At NPS sites across the country, gates will be locked, visitor centers will be closed, and thousands of park rangers will be furloughed,” the Interior Department, which oversees the NPS, <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/government-shutdown-will-close-americas-national-parks-impede-visitor-access" target="_blank">said Friday</a>.</p>
<p>States and nonprofit groups can work with the federal government to fund park operations. The governors of Arizona and Utah have said they will seek such agreements this year. But even those sites may see a disruption in access as agreements are finalized and funding is secured.</p>
<p>Mount Rushmore National Monument in South Dakota, for example, was closed for the first three days of the 16-day shutdown in 2013. After a blizzard, the park reopened for the last three days of the shutdown with the help of nonprofit donations and an agreement with South Dakota’s state government, Cheryl Schreier, the former Mount Rushmore superintendent, said in a Friday interview.</p>
<p>Park sites stayed open with a minimal workforce during the 2018-2019 shutdown. U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking Republican John Barrasso of Wyoming called for the Interior Department to do the same this year and criticized the decision to close parks.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration has the ability to keep our nation’s parks open and accessible,” he said in a statement. “Instead, they’re deliberately trying to make a government shutdown as painful as possible for American families and visitors alike.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_34277" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34277" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Hikers in Shenandoah National Park. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>But the Government Accountability Office said the decision to keep parks open during the shutdown <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-330776.pdf" target="_blank">was illegal</a>. And park advocates have said remaining open without enough workers created problems.</p>
<p>Visitors to Mount Rushmore during the 2018-2019 shutdown “were very confused,” Schreier said. Trash and even human waste piled up as visitors couldn’t find open bathrooms.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials, not visitor services employees, comprised most of the workforce.</p>
<p>“It makes it difficult when you don’t have, obviously, the adequate staff,” Schreier said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Historic, cultural sites to close</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Public tours of the U.S. Capitol will cease, as the Congressional Visitor Center would close down during a funding lapse. This includes tours of the complex’s storied dome.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police will continue to report to work to secure the complex, but they will do so without pay.</p>
<p>“I’ve sent my membership updates to prepare for a shutdown if it happens, which it looks like it will,” said Gus Papathanasiou, chairman of the USCP Labor Committee. “I’m hoping a shutdown doesn’t happen because with the cost of living higher than ever, this shutdown will create an enormous hardship.”</p>
<p>Workers with the Architect of the Capitol, the office charged with maintaining the Capitol buildings and grounds, will continue to work in a limited capacity without pay.</p>
<p>USCP officers and Capitol maintenance staff will receive back pay upon the end of a shutdown.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo will remain open until at least Oct. 7, even if a partial government shutdown is triggered this weekend, according to the institution’s contingency <a href="https://www.si.edu/sites/default/files/about/smithsonian-federal-lapse-plan.pdf" target="_blank">plan</a> released Thursday.</p>
<p>The institution, which employs nearly 4,000 across its several locations, will continue to use fund balances from prior years until they are exhausted.</p>
<p>Just over 1,100 Smithsonian workers will remain on the job during the shutdown to care for animals, continue lab experiments, maintain library archives and secure the facilities.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Student loan repayments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Federal student loan repayment officially begins Oct. 1, and regardless of a shutdown, those payments are still due.</p>
<p>“Even if extreme House Republicans needlessly shut down the government, loan payments will continue to be due starting this month,” a spokesperson from the Department of Education said in a statement to States Newsroom.</p>
<p>The Biden administration did <a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2023/08/28/heres-what-to-know-about-new-federal-policies-for-repaying-student-loans/" target="_blank">launch a one-year on-ramp program </a>where borrowers with federal student loans won’t be faulted for not repaying their loans. However, interest will still accrue.</p>
<p>Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, in a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/shutdown/contingency-plan-2021.pdf" target="_blank">contingency plan</a>, said the department would furlough 90% of its staff. There are about 4,000 full-time and part-time employees.</p>
<p>Programs that would still run because they are mandatory include Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans.</p>
<p>Some programs that would lapse include the development and awarding of grants. The Office for Civil Rights would pause its reviews and investigations and guidance and regulatory actions.</p>

<p>A federal rule limiting agencies’ power to regulate water pollution will severely restrict protections for waters and wetlands throughout the country, but could also be subject to challenges from conservative groups that maintain the new rule exerts more federal jurisdiction than the U.S. Supreme Court intended in a May decision.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-08/Pre-publication%20Version%20of%20the%20Final%20Rule%20-%20Amendments%20to%20the%20Revised%20Definition%20of%20Waters%20of%20the%20United%20States.pdf" target="_blank">rule</a> published Tuesday to redefine which “waters of the United States,” or WOTUS, are covered under the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers aimed to bring the federal definition in line with the Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-narrows-scope-clean-water-act" target="_blank">ruling this year</a> narrowing the scope of federal power.</p>
<p>In a 5-4 decision, the court held the federal government can only regulate waters with “a continuous surface connection” to the types of navigable waters indisputably covered by the Clean Water Act.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ak0L8U3eBe"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/14/virginia-offers-wetland-permit-guidance-following-supreme-courts-sackett-ruling/">Virginia offers wetland permit guidance following Supreme Court&#8217;s Sackett ruling</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia offers wetland permit guidance following Supreme Court&#8217;s Sackett ruling&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/14/virginia-offers-wetland-permit-guidance-following-supreme-courts-sackett-ruling/embed/#?secret=Z1GkkFJQLL#?secret=ak0L8U3eBe" data-secret="ak0L8U3eBe" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/wotus/amendments-2023-rule" target="_blank">revised rule</a>, which will take effect when it is published in the Federal Register in the coming days, removes the “significant nexus” standard that the court invalidated in the Sackett v. EPA case in May.</p>
<p>It also removes federal jurisdiction from wetlands that cross state lines and revised the definition of “adjacent” to mean “having a continuous surface connection,” which is consistent with Justice Samuel Alito’s <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-454_4g15.pdf" target="_blank">majority opinion</a>.</p>
<p>The new definition is broader than some expected, said Ashley Peck, an attorney with Holland and Hart LLP’s water practice, because the Sackett case was only about wetlands, but the agencies removed the significant nexus test for all waters. The EPA likely determined it would reduce future court battles by applying the ruling beyond wetlands, she added.</p>
<p>“EPA is reading the tea leaves to some extent based on the court’s broader holding,” she said. “I think this probably was a good middle ground. … You’re never going to please everybody. But I think this is an effort by EPA to head off more litigation.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Split reaction</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Environmental groups and Democrats in Congress described the updated rule as a faithful execution of the court ruling – even as they said the policy would remove protections from millions of acres across the country.</p>
<p>But key congressional Republicans and conservative legal groups said Tuesday and Wednesday the update resulted from a rushed process and overlooks major criteria the court outlined.</p>
<p>The new definition could impact millions of stream-miles and undermine the main goal of the Clean Water Act, Tannis Fox, a senior attorney with the legal group Western Environmental Law Center, said in a Wednesday interview.</p>
<p>“That purpose has been undermined by the Sackett decision because the federal government is no longer able to protect the biological, physical integrity of these waters,” she said.</p>
<p>Rick Larsen, a Washington Democrat who is the ranking minority member on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in a Tuesday statement he applauded the agencies’ work but disagreed with the court’s decision.</p>
<p>“Ultimately Congress needs to step in and correct the egregious misreading of the Clean Water Act by the Supreme Court to ensure communities continue to have access to clean and safe water,” he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, conservative legal activists and leading Republicans on key congressional committees called the rule an attempt to do the bare minimum required under the Sackett decision.</p>
<p>In a Tuesday statement, House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, and Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Dave Rouzer, a North Carolina Republican, said the revised rule “barely pays lip service” to the court’s decision. They implied the agencies should have started from scratch with a new rule, rather than merely adjusting a definition.</p>
<p>“The Administration is now trying to make Sackett fit with a rule that never should have been issued in the first place,” they said. “This revised rule ignores fundamental concerns laid out in Sackett and is a missed opportunity to finally end longstanding confusion over what constitutes a WOTUS.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Rule eschews public comment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The agencies said they skipped a more thorough rulemaking process because they were only doing as the court instructed.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="rYF4HidcJV"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/06/virginia-wetlands-protections-remain-robust-despite-supreme-court-ruling-say-enviro-groups/">Virginia wetlands protections remain robust despite Supreme Court ruling, say enviro groups</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia wetlands protections remain robust despite Supreme Court ruling, say enviro groups&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/06/virginia-wetlands-protections-remain-robust-despite-supreme-court-ruling-say-enviro-groups/embed/#?secret=7iPSVaod0p#?secret=rYF4HidcJV" data-secret="rYF4HidcJV" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>“Because the sole purpose of this rule is to amend these specific provisions of the 2023 Rule to conform with Sackett, and such conforming amendments do not involve the exercise of the agencies’ discretion, providing advance public notice and seeking comment is unnecessary,” the rule’s preamble reads.</p>
<p>The expedited process was appropriate, Peck said, because the court decision that invalidated existing agency regulations put “jurisdictional determinations at a standstill,” she said. Developers and others who need federal approvals are still waiting, she said.</p>
<p>The agencies “felt compelled to get this rule out so that decisional determinations for industry could continue,” Fox, the environmental attorney, said.</p>
<p>The agencies “tried to hew closely to the decision,” she added.</p>
<p>But Damien Schiff, who successfully led the challenge to the WOTUS rule in the Sackett case as a senior attorney at the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, said the revised definition missed basic parts of the court decision. Holding a normal public comment period would have prevented the agencies from advancing a flawed rule, he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Conservatives take issue with rule’s scope, process</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p>Schiff said the agencies correctly disregarded the significant nexus test.</p>
<p>“That’s the end of where I would say the agencies did a good job,” he said.</p>
<p>The EPA and Army Corps “failed to accurately articulate” new criteria to replace the discarded significant nexus test, Schiff said.</p>
<p>The thrust of the majority opinion in the Sackett case was that only natural water features that could be reasonably described as streams, creeks or rivers could be considered waters of the United States, but the new definition doesn’t fully exclude things like human-made ditches, he said.</p>
<p>And despite the rule’s preamble specifically noting that Sackett requires a surface connection between a wetland and a covered water for the wetland itself to be covered, the court actually went beyond that, Schiff said. Alito’s opinion would have required wetlands to be indistinguishable from covered waters, he said.</p>
<p>Such flaws could have been fixed in a normal rulemaking process, he added.</p>
<p>“I guarantee you that if they had offered a comment period, that we and many, many other groups would have pulled this out and said, ‘Hey, you’re ignoring half the test,’” Schiff said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Uncertainty remains</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Congressional Republicans and others have for years criticized WOTUS rules, which have changed with considerable frequency in the past decade with changing presidential administrations and court decisions. The changes leave interested parties unsure of how to plan for building projects that can take years.</p>
<p>The rule does not provide the regulatory certainty Republicans sought, they said.</p>
<p>“The administration continues to take an unserious approach to issuing a durable rule that provides stability to millions of Americans,” Senate Environment and Public Works ranking Republican Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia said in a statement.</p>
<p>Peck disagreed, saying though the updated rule will require more agency guidance, it appears to be a step toward a firmer regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>“You’re never going to get exact certainty and an exact bright line with this issue,” Peck said. “And if you’re looking for that, it’s an impossible dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new standard will likely be challenged in court, Schiff said – if not in new cases, then in existing lawsuits against the larger Biden administration WOTUS rule.</p>
<p>More uncertainty will come from a lack of federal jurisdiction over more than half of the nation’s water features, Peck and Fox said.</p>
<p>The Sackett decision and regulatory update put <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/alaska-has-more-half-americas-wetlands-new-ruling-could-change-how-theyre-managed" target="_blank">more</a> <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/whats-river-supreme-court-wotus-ruling-will-be-costly-new-mexico-experts-warn" target="_blank">pressure</a> on <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/how-idaho-couples-fight-build-home-near-lake-might-affect-louisianas-wetlands" target="_blank">states</a> that want to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/virginia-offers-wetland-permit-guidance-following-supreme-courts-sackett-ruling" target="_blank">maintain</a> strong protections for waters and wetlands no longer covered by federal agencies. Other states may seek to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/indiana-lawmakers-could-further-dilute-state-wetlands-protections-following-scotus-decision" target="_blank">dilute protections</a>.</p>
<p>That will mean that the rules will differ state by state, creating more confusion, Peck said.</p>
<p>“It’s up to the states to fill in the gap,” Fox said. “And that’s going to look like a patchwork throughout the nation, depending on the politics in a particular state.”</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture will spend another $667 million on rural broadband loans and grants, the department said Monday, marking the fourth round of Biden administration funding under a program that the 2021 infrastructure law invigorated.</p>
<p>Nearly three-quarters of the funding, $493 million, will go toward grants, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said on a Friday press call previewing the announcement. The latest round of funding awards will go to 38 projects in 22 states and the Marshall Islands, according to a release from the USDA.</p>
<p>Nearly $100 million will go toward grants for three projects in Alaska, which is receiving more than any other state in this round of funding.</p>
<p>Among the states included in this round are Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Each recipient requires U.S. House and Senate sponsors and, because of the program’s rural focus, many of the House sponsors are Republicans. Some of both chambers’ most conservative members endorsed projects that are funded.

<p>Most are small telecommunications companies or cooperatives.</p>
<p>The USDA’s ReConnect program is responsible for selecting grant and loan recipients, seeking to fill gaps in high-speed internet access. The program was created on a trial basis in 2018, and Congress added billions in new funding for it in the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law.</p>

<p>The grants and loans allow for broadband access in areas that otherwise would not be profitable for the private sector to provide service.</p>
<p>“We’re delivering this funding because the internet is no longer a luxury,” Mitch Landrieu, the White House coordinator for the infrastructure law, said on the Friday call. “It’s a necessity to fully participate [in] today’s society.”</p>
<p>High-speed internet would allow better access to services including telehealth, remote learning, precision farming and other opportunities in rural areas, Landrieu said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden believes in building infrastructure in all parts of the country, Vilsack said.</p>
<p>“The reality is that we have faced some challenging times in rural places,” the former Iowa governor said. “When we talk about broadband and high-speed internet it really is basically creating the opportunity for people, regardless of their ZIP code, to have a sense of connection, a sense that the federal government cares deeply about their economic opportunity and about their families.”</p>
<p>The funding also serves a climate purpose, Vilsack said.</p>
<p>Farmers looking to take advantage of new climate-smart commodities markets, a program that pays agricultural producers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, would need access to technology that depends on high-speed internet, he said.</p>
<p>High-speed internet is also useful for precision farming, a management practice that requires a large amount of high-resolution data, Landrieu said.</p>
<p>The infrastructure law provided $65 billion for high-speed broadband deployment. The administration is aiming to spend up to $90 billion on broadband deployment, Landrieu said.</p>
<p>Vilsack <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/funding-33-rural-broadband-projects-unveiled-usda" target="_blank">announced $714 million</a> in ReConnect loans and grants in June and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/usda-spend-500-million-extending-high-speed-internet-rural-america" target="_blank">$500 million in September 2022</a>. More funding announcements should be expected in the coming months, he said Friday.</p>

<p>The chamber <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023364" target="_blank">voted 351-67</a> to approve <a href="https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/advocacy/legislative-and-regulatory-issues/faa-reauthorization-and-modernization/House-Bill-2023-FAA-Reauthorization.pdf" target="_blank">the bill</a>, which would authorize $104 billion for the agency through 2028, increase authorized spending levels for rural aviation programs and add some protections for the flying public amid ongoing complaints over cancellations and delays.</p>
<p>“This bill ensures robust investment in infrastructure for airports of all sizes, including the thousands of smaller and general aviation airports that make up the bulk of our aviation system,” U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Chairman Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, said.</p>
<p>The bipartisan support on the floor came after lawmakers kept the measure clear of the controversial social issues a handful of House Republicans <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/defense-bill-targets-abortion-access-trans-health-racial-equity-passes-us-house" target="_blank">attached to the defense authorization bill</a> last week.</p>

Tim Kaine</p>
</div>
	</div>
	
<p>For example, on the FAA bill the chamber <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023353?Page=2" target="_blank">rejected, 181-254</a>, an amendment from Illinois Republican Mary Miller to restrict funding for diversity, equity and inclusion training at the agency. In last week’s defense authorization bill, the House adopted two amendments targeting such programs in the Defense Department.</p>
<p>The committee’s ranking Democrat, Rick Larsen of Washington, praised the process in a Thursday floor speech.</p>
<p>“We are on the verge of passing a comprehensive, bipartisan, negotiated-in-good faith, important, policy-based bill, I presume in a bipartisan manner, which may not make the news because it wasn’t exciting enough,” Larsen said minutes before the vote. “We have prided ourself on being a boring committee, on being a workhorse committee.</p>
<p>The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved the bill on a 63-0 vote last month.</p>
<p>Even after passage, Larsen said he and Graves will have to coordinate with the Senate and White House to see the bill enacted into law. Leaders of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee introduced a companion bill last month, but have not scheduled a committee vote on the measure.</p>
<p>Current FAA authorization expires Sept. 30 and the legislation is considered one of this year’s must-do bills for Congress.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Rural air service, consumer aid</h4>

	
<p>Under Graves, a licensed pilot and longtime champion of general aviation, the bill includes provisions meant to boost air service in rural America.</p>
<p>The measure includes a major increase for the Essential Air Service, a program to subsidize flights to small, rural airports that’s often been targeted for cutbacks or elimination. It would authorize an average of $292 million per year for the program. The current law, enacted in 2018, authorized about $162 million per year on average.</p>
<p>Essential Air Service subsidizes airlines with routes to and from <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2022-01/Current%20list%20of%20EAS-Eligible%20communities%20excl%20AK%20%20HI_Dec2021_0.pdf" target="_blank">110 airports</a> in the contiguous 48 states as of 2021, with dozens more in Alaska and Hawaii. Subsidies of more than $200 per passenger are reserved for airports beyond 210 miles from the nearest mid- or large-hub airport.</p>
<p>The bill also includes an entire title, or section, on general aviation, the non-commercial, non-military flight operations that include flights for agricultural, medical and business travel purposes. It’s the first such title in an FAA authorization bill, according to Graves.</p>
<p>Larsen also praised the measure’s consumer protections sections on the House floor Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Recent flight cancellations and delays have shaken the confidence of passengers in the U.S. aviation system,” Larsen said. “To get us back on the right course, the reauthorization requires airlines to create resiliency plans to address mass flight disruptions.”</p>
<p>The bill would require airlines to publish on their websites guidelines on compensation related to flight delays, diversions, cancellations and mishandled luggage.</p>
<p>It would also create a passenger experience advisory committee, to report to the Transportation secretary and FAA administrator.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fight over D.C. flights </h4>

	
<p>The bill would not alter the routes allowed to serve Washington’s Ronald Reagan National Airport, which sits in Virginia just across the Potomac River from the nation’s capital. Federal law prohibits routes to destinations more than 1,250 miles from the airport, with limited exceptions to cities including Denver, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Portland, Oregon and Seattle.</p>
<p>The provision is meant to protect Dulles International Airport, which is farther out in Northern Virginia from the city center, and proposals for added air traffic out of National Airport proved highly contentious.</p>
<p>Utah Republican Burgess Owens proposed an amendment to allow seven new round-trip flights to National. The measure was <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023357" target="_blank">defeated, 205-229</a>.</p>
<p>Most Democrats voted against the amendment and most Republicans supported it, though dozens from both sides crossed party lines.</p>
<p>Several members of both parties from major metropolitan areas in Texas and California voted to add flights.</p>
<p>Republican Chip Roy and Democrats Joaquin Castro and Henry Cuellar all spoke on the floor to advocate for a direct flight from their San Antonio-area districts.</p>
<p>“My city of San Antonio is known as Military City, USA,” Castro said. “It’s home to tens of thousands of soldiers, airmen, intelligence professionals, and cybersecurity experts who need direct access to Washington, D.C.”</p>
<p>So, too, did most members from Delta Air Lines’ home state of Georgia. Delta supports adding flights to National Airport, also known by its international airport code, DCA. Democrat Lucy McBath was the only member from Georgia to vote against the measure.</p>
<p>“The only reason airlines are opposing this is that they want to limit competition,” U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, a Georgia Democrat, said.</p>
<p>Members from Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and the District of Columbia opposed the measure.</p>
<p>“No one asked our regional delegation about this, and we are united against adding more air traffic at DCA,” Virginia Democrat Don Beyer said. The airport is already overcrowded, with 20% of flights late, he added.</p>
<p>The area’s U.S. Senate delegation is also opposed to adding long-distance flights. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin III, a Democrat from West Virginia, said this week he opposed the idea, fearing airlines may opt to cut short regional flights in favor of longer ones.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation will send more than $2.2 billion in grants to state, tribal and local governments under a grant program that was expanded under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.</p>
<p>The $2.26 billion for 162 projects provides funds for each of the 50 states, two territories and the District of Columbia. It is similar to the allocation for the grant program last year, the first after President Joe Biden signed the $1.2 trillion infrastructure law that added funding for the program.</p>
<p>The projects include improvements and expansions of roads, rail, bridges, pedestrian trails and maritime infrastructure.</p>
<p>In Virginia, <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2023-06/RAISE%202023%20Fact%20Sheets_0.pdf" target="_blank">projects receiving funds</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>$23.2 million for the Eastern Shore of Virginia Rail Trail: &#8220;Funds for this project will convert an approximately 16.8-mile segment of the abandoned Bay Coast Railroad to a 10-foot shared-use path starting at the Town of Nassawadox and connecting to several historic towns until its terminus in the Town of Olney.&#8221;</li>
<li>$14.4 million for the Downtown Harrisonburg Streetscape and Mobility Transformation Project: &#8220;Funds for this project will convert a lane of US-11 (Liberty Street and Noll Drive) to a two-way separated bicycle facility between the intersections of Main Street and Noll Drive and Grattan Street and Liberty Street. A shared use path will also be constructed along Main Street between Grattan Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Way.&#8221;</li>
<li>$3.6 million for improving access and safety for Chesterfield&#8217;s Meadowdale-Meadowbrook community: &#8220;Funds for this project will implement the initial feasibility studies, NEPA documentation, 60 percent construction plans, and public engagement for the Hopkins Interchange and Road Diet. The project includes three core elements: (1) a road diet for approximately 0.9 miles of Hopkins Road from Beulah Road to Meadowdale Boulevard, (2) the Chippenham Parkway and Hopkins Road interchange improvements, and (3) implementation of micro-transit in the Meadowbrook<br />
community.&#8221;</li>
<li>$720,000 for Herndon&#8217;s 2050 Comprehensive Plan</li>
</ul>
<p>The Transportation Department has managed a similar discretionary grant program since 2010, though the name of the program and criteria have changed with each presidential administration. Funding levels, set by Congress, also vary year to year, ranging from roughly $500 million to more than $2 billion in each of the two years since the infrastructure law passed.</p>
<p>Under Biden, the department has prioritized projects that advance climate goals, racial equity and safety.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Local input</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a call with reporters previewing the announcement Tuesday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg emphasized that all the projects were proposed and planned by local authorities.</p>
<p>“It is particularly focused on communities’ needs,” he said. “We don’t design the projects at headquarters. We are proceeding very much on the idea that the answers don’t all come from Washington, but more of the funding should.”</p>
<p>No project received more than $25 million from the program, the maximum for projects of less than $45 million total cost.  The department selected 22 projects to receive that maximum.</p>
<p>The funding is split between rural and urban projects, White House Infrastructure Coordinator Mitch Landrieu told reporters.</p>
<p>Most of the funding — 70% — will go toward either areas of persistent poverty or historically disadvantaged communities. That represented a record high for the program, Buttigieg said.</p>
<p>Many of the communities that received funding had sought federal help for the projects for years, Buttigieg said. The department will work with communities that submitted highly rated proposals that were not accepted in this round to improve their applications for future years, he said.</p>
<p>About 10 projects that received grants this year had applied last year, Assistant Secretary of Transportation Policy Christopher Coes said.</p>

<p>A federal judge in Florida <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/indictment-unsealed-trump-faces-37-felony-counts-classified-documents-probe" target="_blank">unsealed an indictment</a> that accuses former President Donald Trump of hiding classified national security documents after he left the White House, improperly storing them and sharing sensitive information with people who lacked security clearance.</p>
<p>Though he’s not the only former federal official to improperly take classified documents with him after leaving office, federal prosecutors allege Trump did so on purpose and went to great lengths to conceal his possession of them.</p>
<p>It’s the second indictment this year for the former president, who is also facing state business records fraud charges in New York.</p>
<p>Trump is running for the Republican nomination for president.</p>
<p>News of the indictment, which Trump delivered himself on social media Thursday evening, sparked divided reactions among members of Congress and Trump’s fellow contenders for the GOP nomination.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why was Trump indicted? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>According to a 37-count indictment, Trump brought boxes of classified documents with him from Washington to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, when he left office.</p>
<p>When pressed by the National Archives and Records Administration — and, later, by the Florida federal grand jury — he did not return all the documents with classified material.</p>
<p>Many documents were marked top secret and contained highly sensitive information about U.S. and foreign military capabilities. Trump knew the materials were classified and went to great lengths to conceal his possession of them, even after the grand jury subpoenaed them, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>The FBI searched Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club and residence in South Florida in August 2022 and discovered classified material Trump had failed to turn over.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What did Trump say about the indictment? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In written statements and a video posted to his social media platform, Truth Social, on Thursday, Trump called himself “an innocent man” and painted himself as the victim of political attacks.</p>
<p>Trump also noted his successor, President Joe Biden, had also improperly stored classified material after Biden’s tenure as vice president.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is the next step?</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p>Trump said he will make an appearance at a federal courthouse in Miami on Tuesday.</p>
<p>That would be an arraignment, where the charges against him are formally presented and he enters a plea.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Trump has continued posting on Truth Social. He has not indicated any disruption to his schedule, which includes an appearance at the Georgia Republican Convention on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What has Biden said?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>During a tour of Nash Community College in North Carolina on Friday, Biden was asked about the indictment. “I have no comment,” he said.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters Friday, White House spokeswoman Olivia Dalton declined to comment and deferred questions to the Justice Department, which she noted “runs its criminal investigations independently.”</p>
<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland added another layer between the prosecution and political figures by appointing special counsel Jack Smith to oversee the prosecution in November.</p>
<p>Pressed to respond to Republican criticisms that the prosecution was political, Dalton said Biden would not weigh in to avoid any perception of White House interference.</p>
<p>“That’s precisely why we’re not commenting here,” she said. Biden “believes in respecting the independence of the DOJ and protecting the integrity of their processes. And that’s, again, why we’ll leave it there.”</p>
<p>Trump, who lost to Biden in 2020, leads polls to win the Republican nomination to challenge Biden in next year’s election.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What has the special counsel said?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a brief public appearance Friday, Smith said his office plans to “seek a speedy trial in this matter, consistent with the public interest and the rights of the accused.”</p>
<p>“Our laws that protect national defense information are critical to the safety and security of the United States, and they must be enforced,” Smith said. “Violations of those laws put our country at risk.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hasn’t Biden also had problems with documents?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-defends-delay-revealing-classified-documents-biden-private-office-home" target="_blank">Yes</a>. And so has Trump’s vice president, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/classified-material-found-indiana-home-former-vp-mike-pence" target="_blank">Mike Pence</a>.</p>
<p>Biden attorneys discovered classified documents dating from his tenure as vice president in the Obama administration in November at the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement, a Washington think tank associated with the president. They alerted federal authorities, who searched Biden’s private home and discovered more classified documents on Dec. 20, Jan. 11 and Jan. 12.</p>
<p>Pence in January alerted the FBI about a “small number of documents” with classified markings that were found in his Indiana home.</p>
<p>Both Biden and Pence self-reported the improper possession of materials.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Wasn’t Trump already indicted?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-hit-34-felony-counts-falsifying-new-york-state-business-records" target="_blank">Yes</a>, in New York state court on felony charges he falsified business records by using campaign cash to pay hush money to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump pleaded not guilty to the state charges.</p>
<p>Thursday’s indictment was related to separate activity and on federal charges. No other former president has been charged in a federal indictment.</p>
<p>He is also under investigation for <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/brief/fulton-county-da-willis-rebuts-trumps-efforts-to-remove-her-from-2020-election-probe/" target="_blank">election interference in Georgia</a>.</p>
<p>And the U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol made a criminal referral to the U.S. Justice Department to probe Trump’s role in instigating that riot.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are other Republican presidential candidates saying?</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p>At this point in the race, Trump’s rivals for the GOP nomination are largely defining themselves in relation to the former president. Their reactions to the indictment reflected their position on Trump.</p>
<p>Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson called on Trump to drop out of the race.</p>
<p>Fellow Trump critic former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie voiced skepticism of Trump’s account and said he would wait for more facts to come out, but added that “no one is above the law, no matter how much they wish they were.”</p>
<p>Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who has said Trump inspired his entrance into politics and presents himself as a Trump ally, blasted the indictment as an example of selective prosecution.</p>
<p>“We can’t have two tiers of justice: one for Trump, another for Biden,” he said.</p>
<p>Trump’s strongest competitor, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, sounded a similar note.</p>
<p>“We have for years witnessed an uneven application of the law depending upon political affiliation,” he said, adding that as president he would “bring accountability to the DOJ, excise political bias and end weaponization once and for all.</p>
<p>And Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin <a href="https://twitter.com/GlennYoungkin/status/1667167258546692098" target="_blank">in a lengthy tweet</a> said, &#8220;These charges are unprecedented and it’s a sad day for our country, especially in light of what clearly appears to be a two-tiered justice system where some are selectively prosecuted, and others are not. Parents in Virginia know firsthand what it’s like to be targeted by politically motivated actions. Regardless of your party, this undermines faith in our judicial system at exactly the time when we should be working to restore that trust.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How are Republicans in Congress reacting?</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p>They’re mostly defending Trump, with House members more united in that effort.</p>
<p>“Today is indeed a dark day for the United States of America,” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said in a Thursday post to Twitter. “It is unconscionable for a President to indict the leading candidate opposing him.”</p>
<p>McCarthy pledged to “stand with President Trump against this grave injustice.”</p>
<p>U.S. House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio tweeted, “Sad day for America. God Bless President Trump.”</p>
<p>“This sham indictment is the continuation of the endless political persecution of Donald Trump,” U.S. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana said.</p>
<p>“A sitting president arresting his political opponent is the ultimate weaponization of government,” Kentucky’s Thomas Massie said.</p>
<p>In the Senate, Republicans were quieter, and one, Utah’s Mitt Romney, criticized Trump.</p>
<p>“Mr. Trump brought these charges upon himself by not only taking classified documents, but by refusing to simply return them when given numerous opportunities to do so,” Romney said in a statement.</p>
<p>The top two Senate Republicans, Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Whip John Thune of South Dakota, had not released statements by Friday afternoon. Thune has already endorsed South Carolina U.S. Sen. Tim Scott for president.</p>
<p>The Senate’s No. 3 Republican, Conference Chairman John Barrasso of Wyoming, said the indictment “certainly looks like an unequal application of justice.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What about Democrats?</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p>Congressional Democrats have for years sought to prosecute Trump for various alleged misdeeds. Thursday and Friday, many implored Trump to be prosecuted without any regard for his former position.</p>
<p>“Today’s federal grand jury indictment tells us that former President Donald Trump put our national security in grave danger as he pursued yet another lawless personal agenda by pilfering and hoarding government documents,” House Oversight Committee ranking Democrat Jamie Raskin of Maryland said Thursday.</p>
<p>Trump “will have his day in court, in Miami and Manhattan and Atlanta too if it comes to it,” House Judiciary ranking Democrat Jerry Nadler of New York tweeted. “But I am grateful to live in a nation where no man is above the law.”</p>
<p>Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and member of the Judiciary Committee, tweeted that Trump should be treated like any other defendant.</p>
<p>“Due process and rule of law are essential American virtues, upon which politics must never intrude,” he wrote. “This case will play out under established law and judicial supervision.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will this affect Trump’s campaign?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>We don’t know.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom in pre-Trump American politics was that a criminal investigation would sink a candidate. And the indictment contains damning details alleging Trump jeopardized national security.</p>
<p>But Trump has routinely harnessed potentially damaging news stories to feed a narrative that media and government elites unfairly target him. He broke the news of the indictment himself and sent a fundraising email to supporters within hours.</p>
<p>Trump could hold the office of president even with a criminal record, National Public Radio <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/22/1164822171/trump-run-president-campaign-arrest-charges-voters-indictment" target="_blank">has reported</a>. The Constitution requires only that an individual be at least 35 years old and a natural-born citizen who has lived in the country for at least 14 years.</p>

<p>As smoke from Canadian wildfires caused the most hazardous air conditions on record in the Washington, D.C., area on Thursday, members of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee said that Congress should lift federal firefighter pay and encourage logging to reduce the risk of future blazes.</p>
<p>“Smoke from the wildfires burning right now in Canada has been affecting the skies, as you can see outside,” committee Chairman Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat, said. “And if you’ve been outside, you can sure taste it.”</p>
<p>Administration officials at the hearing, which was scheduled before massive fires in southeastern Canada drifted to major East Coast cities this week, appealed for more funding for federal wildland firefighters.</p>
<p>Members of both parties on the committee also pushed for allowing more logging to reduce fire risk in overgrown forests.</p>
<p>Several members of the panel commented on the timing of the hearing as a haze descended on the nation’s capital. The meeting was scheduled before smoke moved into East Coast cities, creating eerie images and putting more than 100 million people in the U.S. under<a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/06/07/most-of-maryland-in-code-red-for-air-quality-due-to-wildfires-in-canada/" target="_blank"> Air Quality Index alerts</a>, according to a White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/08/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-administration-supports-communities-impacted-by-wildfires-and-smoke/" target="_blank">fact sheet</a>.</p>
<p>While smoky conditions are more common in the Western U.S. and Canada, the more densely populated East Coast is rarely affected. Smoke this week has lingered from <a href="https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/briefs/dem-to-receive-178k-for-air-quality-monitoring-amid-canadian-wildfire/" target="_blank">New England</a> to North Carolina.</p>
<p><em>[<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/canadian-and-western-wildfires-bring-hazardous-smoke-to-virginia/" target="_blank">Read more from July 2021: Canadian and western wildfires bring hazardous smoke to Virginia</a>]</em></p>
<p>Some members from Western states said the experience should help people in Washington and New York understand common conditions in Western summers.</p>
<p>“I think America is waking up — at least on the East Coast — to this problem,” Washington state Democrat Maria Cantwell said. “And we certainly have known all about it on the West Coast for some time now.”</p>
<p>“It’s really appropriate to be holding this hearing,” Idaho Republican Jim Risch said. “For those of you who live on the East Coast, welcome to our air in the West. This is common. I don’t remember a summer in Boise when we haven’t had smoke.”</p>

<p>In a written statement, President Joe Biden called the smoke “another stark reminder of the impacts of climate change.”</p>
<p>Biden has sent U.S. firefighting personnel and equipment to help with the fires, especially in Quebec, he said. He also spoke Wednesday with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to offer more support, he said.</p>
<p>The president said the U.S. Transportation Department was watching impacts on commercial flights.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was monitoring air quality in affected areas. Biden noted citizens can see readings at the ZIP code level at <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/" target="_blank">airnow.gov</a>, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was updating public health guidance.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Firefighter ‘pay cliff’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden has also pushed for a permanent pay raise for federal wildland firefighters.</p>
<p>The bipartisan infrastructure law that he championed and signed in 2021 included a two-year raise, but agencies are now facing a “pay cliff,” Jeffrey Rupert, the director of the U.S. Interior Department’s Office of Wildland Management, told the Senate panel.</p>
<p>“The bill funding is estimated to run out at the end of this fiscal year,” Rupert said. “That could have a devastating effect on not only our firefighter morale, but certainly our ability to recruit and retain firefighters.”</p>
<p>More than 4,000 firefighters at Interior received a boost in pay from the infrastructure law’s temporary supplement, Rupert said. Interior employs more than 5,000 wildland firefighters, making it the second-largest federal firefighting workforce behind the U.S. Forest Service’s 10,000 firefighters.</p>
<p>The Forest Service aspires to hire nearly 1,000 more firefighters in the next fiscal year, Jaelith Hall-Rivera, the agency’s deputy chief of state, private, and tribal forestry, said at the hearing.</p>
<p>Having the supplemental pay expire “would be absolutely catastrophic,” Hall-Rivera told Nevada Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto. A union representing Forest Service workers has said as many as 30% to 50% of Forest Service firefighters would leave to find better wages elsewhere, Hall-Rivera said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Let’s harvest’ forests</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>But some Republicans said the administration has already spent too much ineffectively and indicated they opposed further funding increases, saying federal efforts should instead be on overhauling policy to allow more tree harvesting.</p>
<p>“It is unsustainable to keep throwing more and more money and resources at suppression without dramatically increasing mitigation,” ranking Republican John Barrasso of Wyoming said. “America’s wildfire crisis will continue to escalate until our forests are properly managed. Our forests are overgrown and they are unhealthy.”</p>
<p><em>[<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/05/04/fire-was-once-the-enemy-of-the-forester-now-its-a-tool-for-regenerating-appalachias-forests/" target="_blank">Read more: Fire was once the forester&#8217;s enemy. Now it&#8217;s a tool for regenerating Appalachia&#8217;s forests.</a>]</em></p>
<p>Barrasso did say wildland firefighters “have been asked to do too much for too little in return” and should be “fully supported and compensated.”</p>
<p>House Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, a Republican from Arkansas, used similar critiques of the Biden administration’s approach in a June 2 statement on the approaching 2023 fire season.</p>
<p>“It is encouraging to see that President Biden and some in his administration are recognizing the need for forest management,” Westerman said. “Until we make these long-term changes, land managers will continue having to sacrifice ounces of prevention for pounds of cure, all of which costs more and more money while doing nothing to mitigate the underlying issues.”</p>
<p>Barrasso said Thursday more trees should be removed from overgrown forests. Crowded forests can fuel more intense fires that spread more rapidly.</p>
<p>Hall-Rivera and Wyoming interim State Forester Kelly Norris agreed that forests should see more “active management,” which includes cutting down some trees.</p>
<p>Manchin, a centrist Democrat, agreed, saying that overgrown forests should be used for timber products.</p>
<p>“Let’s harvest,” he said near the end of the hearing. “It doesn’t cost anything. We make money and we solve both problems.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Climate connection</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Forest overgrowth, the product of a century of aggressive fire suppression, has contributed to worsening wildfires, experts say.</p>
<p>A changing climate, largely the product of carbon emissions from fossil fuels and other sources, has also worsened conditions.</p>
<p>Periods of lengthy, extreme drought have dried forests, Rupert said. Drier trees are more susceptible to fire.</p>
<p>“That absolutely is a huge part of driving these catastrophic megafires that we’re experiencing,” he said</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, a Democrat from New Mexico, which saw record wildfires last year, said effects of the drier climate are noticeable.</p>
<p>“There are times when there’s more moisture in a two-by-four at Home Depot than there is in a standing live ponderosa pine in our forests in New Mexico,” he said.</p>
<p>Heinrich also said he supported active management, but said to be effective, such treatments should focus on removing smaller trees that can be “ladder” fuels and leave the large standing trees that sequester carbon.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — A U.S. default on its debt would have a significantly broader impact on federal operations, financial markets and the global economy than recent government shutdowns that have left ordinary Americans largely untouched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the two have been confused frequently during debate over the debt limit, the federal government has had considerable practice with partial government shutdowns during the past decade — unlike a default on the debt, which would be uncharted territory. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned default could come as soon as June 1 without an agreement between Congress and President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government shutdowns don’t hit payments for Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, since Congress places those programs in the mandatory category that’s exempt from the annual government funding process and therefore predominantly exempt from funding lapses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A default would potentially reduce payments that keep millions of households afloat, as well as payments to states and providers for health care for elderly and low-income Americans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government shutdowns don’t affect the financial markets that much anymore, meaning Americans’ retirement accounts typically don’t start shrinking the longer a lapse in government operations extends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists expect that would be much different in an unprecedented debt default. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Galston, Ezra K. Zilkha chair and senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said partial government shutdowns and a default on the debt are “almost like mirror images of each other.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the first case, there’s money available but no plan to authorize and appropriate expenditures of that money. That’s when the government shuts down,” explained Galston, who served as a top domestic official in the Clinton administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you reach the debt limit, the government has already enacted programs — some of which are permanent programs, like Social Security and Medicare — but it no longer has the money to pay for them, because it can’t borrow what it needs to fill the gap between what it’s taking in and what it would have to put out,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That even includes the military. The Pentagon is bracing for a series of “severe” and unknown consequences for troops and national security should lawmakers fail to address the debt ceiling, officials told States Newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because there is no precedent for a default, it is difficult to know the precise impacts on specific federal programs. But what’s clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” a Pentagon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here are more of the specific ways a default could roll across America:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Social Security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the U.S. government defaults, payments to the estimated </span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">67 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people who are relying on Social Security this year could be delayed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Security is the </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11615" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> government program in terms of how many Americans are affected by it, including retired workers and dependents, people with disabilities and surviving dependents of deceased workers who count on Social Security payments as a major source of income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A temporary disruption in payments to those who depend on Social Security income to pay their own bills could result in “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">impacts that would ripple through the economy at-large,” </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/default-would-have-a-catastrophic-impact-on-the-economy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jean Ross, a senior fellow for economic policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of 2022, roughly 48.6 million retired workers along with 2.7 million of their dependents relied on Social Security checks that averaged $1,825 a month, according to the Social Security Agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. </span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $1.2 trillion on Social Security benefits in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The short story here is that U.S. taxpayers owe people money because of legislation enacted in the past. We can talk about what kinds of recent legislation have pushed up federal borrowing means, but in fact some of this legislation was passed 90 years ago,” said Wendy Edelberg,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> director of The Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in economic studies at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, on a call Thursday with a group of economists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We owe interest to those who have lent to the U.S. by purchasing Treasury securities. We owe (money to) doctors and hospitals who have treated Medicare and Medicaid patients, and millions of people are entitled to benefits,” said Edelberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Social Security Administration referred all questions about a possible default to the U.S. Treasury. Treasury did not respond to an inquiry for more information.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veterans benefits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veterans Administration Press Secretary Terrence Hayes said he does not have a “blueprint for what happens to the VA” if lawmakers do not strike a deal in the coming days. The Treasury Department will soon exhaust all special accounting maneuvers it has been using since January when the U.S. hit its $31.4 trillion debt ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because there is no precedent for a default, it is difficult to know the precise impacts on specific federal programs. But what is clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” Hayes said in an emailed statement to States Newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Treasury makes payments totaling $25 billion on behalf of the VA each month, according to the agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are 4 million disabled veterans whose payments are scheduled for June 1, and those payments are now uncertain,” said Edelberg, citing recent estimates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more detailed list of those payments, according to the VA’s figures, include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$12 billion per month in benefits payments to more than 7.1 million veterans and their families</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4.8 billion per month in pay to more than 451,000 VA employees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.6 billion per month to community providers caring for roughly 900,000 veterans per month</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.8 billion per month to medical and other contractors, on over 114,000 contracts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$835 million per month in pharmacy costs, for roughly 57,000 monthly payments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion per month for other costs, including to small and veteran-owned businesses</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayes also said there is a risk that the VA’s vendors could decide “to reduce or completely cease providing goods and services to VA if payment was uncertain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As President Biden has made clear, a default would be catastrophic for the American people and for our nation’s veterans,” he said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Medicare and Medicaid</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government payments to physicians, skilled nursing homes, hospitals and insurance companies could lag behind if lawmakers do not raise the U.S. borrowing limit so that the government can pay its bills on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of September 2022, more than </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/pillar/expand-access" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">65 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Americans were enrolled in Medicare, the federal program that pays for health care for Americans age 65 and up and certain younger people with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare plans are categorized into four options — parts A, B, C and D — that range from inpatient hospital stay coverage to prescription drug benefits and various medical services in between. As of 2022, 49 million Americans relied on Medicare Part D for prescription drug coverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Private practices, hospitals, and community health centers, many of which run on tight budgets and rely on timely payments for providing services, would be in the unprecedented situation of being unsure of whether they will be paid for providing care to patients covered by Medicaid and Medicare,” said Antoinette Kraus, spokesperson for the advocacy group Pennsylvania Health Access Network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A default would create tremendous uncertainty for doctors and patients alike. Patients who are receiving treatment for a serious health condition or who require regular care for a disability or chronic condition could find themselves unable to get the care they need,” Kraus said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-income individuals, including children, disabled or pregnant persons and seniors, can receive health care coverage under Medicaid, a joint federal-state program that provides medical and long-term care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the more than 93 million Americans enrolled in some form of Medicaid, 46.2% were children, according to January </span><a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/report-highlights/index.html#:~:text=93%2C008%2C246%20individuals%20were%20enrolled%20in,individuals%20were%20enrolled%20in%20CHIP." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is very likely that federal Medicaid payments to states would, along with many other obligations of the federal government, be delayed,” said Kate McEvoy, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. “Default is a very different scenario from an impasse in settling the federal budget, in which case payments for Medicaid and other entitlements continue to be made.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most nursing home residents </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10343" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Medicaid and Medicare to cover their care, meaning a potential default is especially alarming to the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the long term care industry already experiencing a historic workforce crisis and recovering from the pandemic, any disruption of lifeline reimbursements will result in devastating consequences for our nation’s most vulnerable individuals who need access to care. However, we remain optimistic that policymakers will come to a solution,” said a spokesperson for the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, which identifies itself as the largest association in the U.S. representing long-term care facilities.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal employees</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a partial government shutdown, exempt federal employees report to work without pay, while non-exempt federal workers are sent home without pay — a situation Congress remedies once they reach a funding agreement. The exempt employees keep the government functioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Federation of Government Employees Public Policy Director Jacqueline Simon said a default on the debt that lasts long enough for federal employees to miss a paycheck would be a vastly different experience than what they’ve dealt with during past shutdowns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union, which represents 750,000 workers within the federal government and the District of Columbia’s local government, hasn’t sent any guidance to its members about what to do if they don’t get paid during a default. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an unprecedented situation and operations will be in uncharted waters,” Simon said. “And there’s no way to make guidance based on law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public safety employees, Simon said, have worked without pay during past partial government shutdowns with a promise they’d get paid eventually when a bipartisan agreement was struck — something she expects they would do after a debt default is resolved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In previous shutdowns, public safety employees have been called into work, expected to show up to work with the promise that they’d get paid eventually when the appropriations bills pass,” Simon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I assume there’d be a similar kind of situation where you don’t even need appropriations bills to pass, you just need the default to end,” she said, later adding that because the United States has never defaulted, “nobody really knows.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Substance use prevention and recovery, mental health</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. is facing a staggering drug overdose epidemic, and many states and local governments rely on </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46426" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for prevention and treatment efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug overdose rates in the U.S. have risen fivefold in the past two decades, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db457.htm#:~:text=Drug%20overdose%20deaths%20have%20risen,increased%20from%2017.1%20to%2019.6." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in December. In 2021 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the CDC </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/202205.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a record 107,622 overdose deaths — of which 71,238 were due to manmade, illegal fentanyl substances, an issue in the crosshairs of both Democrats and Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illicit fentanyl ending up in other drugs — for example, counterfeit prescription pills, cocaine and heroin — has been the target of </span><a href="https://www.dea.gov/onepill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal agencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the subject of multiple congressional hearings and </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/01/26/u-s-house-gop-takes-aim-at-fake-pills-containing-deadly-fentanyl-sold-on-social-media/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roundtables</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, administers two major grant programs: one for substance abuse prevention and treatment services, the other for mental health services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency, housed under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46426" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">devoted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 65% of its $5.89 billion program budget in 2020 to treatment programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilities that receive federal dollars could be in limbo if the government defaults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a little hard to tell. I don’t know if the publicly funded facilities would stop accepting patients or if they would assume that it’s going to be paid at a later date. And, you know, it’s just so unclear and up in the air because this is such an unusual situation,” said Mark Dunn, director of public policy for the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAMHSA did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">National defense</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin </span><a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/hearings/review-of-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-budget-request-for-the-department-of-defense" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate appropriators on May 11 that a potential default brings uncertainty for the over </span><a href="https://demographics.militaryonesource.mil/chapter-1-total-military-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.4 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> military personnel and the U.S. military’s global presence and commitments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is substantial risk to our reputation,” Austin testified. “Again, we are viewed as being a source of stability globally. And we always pay our debts, and there’s just a number of things that we’re working with allies and partners on and that would come into question as to whether or not we’ll be able to execute programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But most importantly, this will affect the livelihood of our troops and our civilians. We won’t be able to pay people like we should and, and I think that’s something that China and everybody else can exploit,” he continued.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">USDA food assistance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One in four Americans, from infants to seniors, participate in one of the 15 food and nutrition assistance programs offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those programs offer monthly assistance, such as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, referred to as WIC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the government defaults, monthly payments to more than </span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/34SNAPmonthly-5.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">42.5 million Americans on </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">SNAP, and monthly payments to the more than 6 million families on WIC, could be delayed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent bill that House Republicans barely </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/04/26/u-s-house-gop-pushes-through-debt-ceiling-increase-coupled-with-massive-spending-cuts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporarily raise the U.S. borrowing limit also tightened access to food and assistance for low-income Americans by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expediting the effective dates for safety net work requirements — from 2025 to 2024 for SNAP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SNAP already has </span><a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/work-requirements" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two sets of work requirements.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another program that could be affected if there are delays in payments is the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, where each month USDA sends packed foods to about </span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/fdpir-program-fact-sheet-2020-for%20website.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84,000 individuals on Native American reservations.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A USDA spokesperson said in an email that the exact impact of certain federal programs can depend on uncertain factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But what’s clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S</span><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=104891#:~:text=The%20USDA%27s%20National%20School%20Lunch,schools%20and%20residential%20childcare%20institutions." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chool lunches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which USDA provides for more than 30 million children each day, could also be affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other child nutrition programs that could get wrapped up in payment delays include the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program and the Special Milk Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisa Davis, the senior vice president of the No Kid Hungry campaign at Share Our Strength, said in an email that a default would have a devastating impact on families and individuals who rely on food assistance programs such as SNAP. Share Our Strength is a national organization that aims to end child hunger and poverty in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only is SNAP being used as a bargaining chip in these negotiations, but the people who benefit from this critical program will be some of the individuals hit hardest if a government default becomes reality,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers could also run into problems if there are delays to any USDA payments, ranging from crop insurance payouts to new loans for expanding farming operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDA </span><a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/05/01/usda-providing-130-million-assistance-help-farmers-facing-financial" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in early May an additional $130 million in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatic financial assistance for qualifying farm loan program borrowers who are facing financial risk. Those who qualify will receive automatic payments from the Farm Service Agency, but those funds could be delayed if the country were to default on its debt.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Homeland security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the U.S. government were to default, it would mean the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would have to delay payments to various private contractors such as those that run </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration and Customs Enforcement </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">detention facilities, and even delays in grants to nonprofits that provide aid and transportation to migrants seeking asylum.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would also mean that the more than </span><a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/factsheets/tsa-glance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50,000 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation Security Administration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s across more than 440 airports could have their paychecks delayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court proceedings before immigration judges would also be delayed. There is already a more than </span><a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/us-immigration-backlogs-mounting-undermine-biden" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6 million backlog of cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Justice, which handles immigration court proceedings, did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Highways and transit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Highway Trust Fund, which sends money from federal gas and diesel taxes to states for road and transit maintenance and construction, could also see a rare disruption in outlays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On paper, the trust fund has a healthy balance — it was </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/highwaytrustfund/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$94.2 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if Treasury doesn’t have the money to actually spend, that could mean payments from the trust fund would be delayed, said Jeff Davis, a transportation spending expert and senior fellow at the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonpartisan think tank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making debt service payments, there’s no clear indication what already-obligated spending would take priority, putting highway and transit funds on par with scores of other programs, Davis said, cautioning that his analysis was provisional because it was not backed by precedent or Treasury Department guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think they’re going to have to wait in line with everybody else,” Davis said of Highway Trust Fund payments if the debt limit is hit. “Just because there’s theoretically that much money in the trust fund doesn’t make a difference if there’s actually no dollars in the Treasury.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Conservation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservation advocates won a huge legislative victory in 2020 when Congress passed the Great American Outdoors Act that provided $900 million annually for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and removed the fund from the annual appropriations process by classifying it as mandatory spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2020, the fund, which is filled by fees on offshore oil and gas development and used to protect national parks and forests, wildlife refuges, coasts and other natural areas and provides matching grants for state and local recreation projects, was subject to periodic fights over its funding levels and — at times — its continued existence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents considered the 2020 law approving the fund in perpetuity a once-in-a-generation victory. Montana Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, a leading proponent of the measure, thanked then-President Donald Trump “for signing the most important piece of conservation legislation in over 50 years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a default could reintroduce the uncertainty proponents thought they’d erased with the 2020 law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A default would be an economic disaster across the board — even in ways we don’t know yet,” U.S. House Natural Resources ranking member Raúl Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, said in a written statement. “The Treasury would likely have to make tough calls about extraordinary measures to redirect mandatory funds to pay our debt, so even widely beloved programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund could be at-risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for the U.S. Interior Department, which manages the fund, declined to comment on what would happen in a potential default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t speculate on unforeseen circumstances,” the spokeswoman, Melissa Schwartz, wrote in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Daines spokeswoman Rachel Dumke declined to entertain the possibility of default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Senator Daines does not see a default on the national debt as an option and he is calling on President Biden to make a deal with Speaker McCarthy as soon as possible to avoid a crisis,” she wrote in an email.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing assistance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in an email that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HUD handles rental assistance, housing vouchers, claims of unfair housing practices, obtaining affordable loans and public housing, among other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of HUD’s key agency programs and initiatives, which play a vital role for Americans across the country, could be halted or severely delayed … which would impact our nation’s most vulnerable communities,” the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_23_045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the agency announced more than 2,400 grants totaling $5.6 billion in funding for 1,200 communities across the U.S. for community development, homeless assistance and affordable housing. Payments to those programs could be delayed if the government defaults.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Agriculture will begin to administer two loan and grant programs worth nearly $11 billion to boost clean energy systems in rural areas, administration officials said Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress approved the federal spending — $9.7 billion for a grant and loan program the department is calling the New Empowering Rural America program, or New ERA, and $1 billion for a Powering Affordable Clean Energy program that will provide partly forgivable loans — in the energy, health and taxes </span><a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/sites/default/files/USDA_IRA_RDExtract.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democrats passed last summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding “continues an ongoing effort to ensure that rural America is a full participant in this clean energy economy,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters on a teleconference in advance of the announcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural areas can have more difficulty than more urban ones in attracting private sector investment, White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi said. The programs are intended to allow those rural areas to take advantage of an industry-wide trend to invest in clean energy production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a favorable wind blowing here,” he said. “This allows rural communities to put up a sail.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The programs are meant to put rural electric cooperatives on equal footing with larger privately owned companies that have already put major funding into clean energy deployment, Vilsack said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The programs represent the largest single funding effort for rural electrification since President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Rural Electrification Act in 1936, a USDA press release said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money is meant not only to address the climate impacts of fossil fuel energy and reduce home energy costs, but to act as an economic engine for rural areas, Zaidi said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zaidi cited </span><a href="https://stateline.org/2023/01/18/wind-farms-deliver-economic-jolt-to-rural-middle-america/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Stateline analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that showed seven of the top 10 largest gross domestic product growth increases between 2019 and 2021 had significant wind farm production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a proven driver of economic growth on the ground,” Zaidi said. “We want more folks to be able to tap into that opportunity. We&#8217;re seeing this not only translates into lower energy costs, but, to places that had been shut down, turning back on as sources of economic opportunity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural electric cooperatives are eligible for the New ERA program. Up to 25% of the funding in that program can be in the form of direct grants. Utilities can use the money to build renewable energy systems, zero-emission systems and carbon capture facilities, according to the department release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The climate law allows “the stacking of benefits,” Vilsack said. That means utilities that receive loans and grants through the program can also use the clean energy tax credits that were approved in the law, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USDA will begin to accept initial applications for funding on July 31. Applicants are expected to write more detailed proposals for funding after the USDA accepts their initial applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PACE program provides loans to renewable energy developers and electric service providers “to help finance large-scale solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, hydropower projects and energy storage in support of renewable energy systems,” the release said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program is targeted to “vulnerable, disadvantaged, Tribal and energy communities,” the release said. It’s in line with a Biden administration goal to give at least 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal spending to disadvantaged communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USDA can forgive up to 40% of most of the loans in the program. Up to 60% of loans to applicants in some U.S. territories and tribal communities can be forgiven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial applications for that program will open June 30. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As TikTok has mushroomed to more than 150 million monthly U.S. users, so have warnings among both state legislators and members of Congress about its potential danger as a tool of the Chinese government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dozens of states, including Virginia, and the federal government this year banned public employees from downloading the popular app on their government devices. But the Montana legislature went further and on Friday passed the nation’s </span><a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/04/13/montana-house-advances-tiktok-ban-rejects-amendment-to-make-it-apply-more-broadly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first statewide ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though GOP Gov. Greg Gianforte has not yet signed the measure and it’s not clear how it would be enforced. If it becomes law, it would go into effect Jan. 1.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of both parties in </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/members-congress-blast-tiktok-ceo-bipartisan-support-us-ban-looks-possible" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a U.S. House hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March told TikTok CEO Shou Chew they were considering a total nationwide ban. That idea has raised a slew of objections, not the least of which is how banning an app that provides a platform for speech could be consistent with the First Amendment.</span></p>
<p>In Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued an <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-24---Banning-the-Use-of-Certain-Applications-and-Websites-on-State-Government-Technology.pdf" target="_blank">executive order</a> in December banning the use of TikTok, another Chinese app known as WeChat and &#8220;any other applications developed by&#8221; their parent companies &#8220;on any government-issued devices, including state-issued cell phones, laptops, or other devices capable of connecting to the internet except for public safety purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;TikTok and WeChat data are a channel to the Chinese Communist Party, and their continued presence represents a threat to national security, the intelligence community, and the personal privacy of every single American,&#8221; said Youngkin in <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/december/name-948259-en.html" target="_blank">a release</a>.</p>
<p>During its most recent session, the Virginia General Assembly passed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1459" target="_blank">legislation</a> putting those restrictions into state law.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below are answers to five common questions about the debate in the nation’s capital.</span><b></b></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why does Congress want to ban TikTok?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of both parties have expressed concerns about TikTok’s data collection practices and its ties to the Chinese Communist Party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chew said the data TikTok collects from users is no different from those of other platforms, including domestic products like Instagram. TikTok is based in Singapore and Los Angeles, Chew said. The product is not even available in China, whose ruling Communist Party does not offer the same guarantees of free speech as the U.S. Constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But lawmakers say TikTok is unique because the Chinese government could compel the company to provide its user data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, is Chinese, and is beholden to laws that require private companies to provide information to Chinese authorities, lawmakers have said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The CCP’s laws require Chinese companies like ByteDance to spy on their behalf,” Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the chairwoman of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, told Chew during the March 23 hearing. “That means any Chinese company must grant the CCP access and manipulation capabilities as a design feature.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts to ban TikTok are also part of a trend of lawmakers seeking to appear tough on China. U.S. House Republicans created a select committee this year to respond to China’s rising power. And members of both parties have voiced support for restrictions on foreign ownership of farmland, mainly targeting China. </span><b></b></p>
<p>In Virginia, the General Assembly passed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB1438ER2" target="_blank">a bill</a> earlier this year prohibiting any &#8220;foreign adversary&#8221; from acquiring &#8220;any interest in agricultural land in the Commonwealth.&#8221; The legislation gained support from both Republicans and Democrats, although Democrats were split on the proposal.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What proposals have the most support?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are leading contenders from a host of options in each chamber of Congress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, 13 Democrats and 13 Republicans have signed on to support the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/686/text" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RESTRICT Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, written by Virginia Democrat Mark Warner and South Dakota Republican John Thune. Jake Sullivan, a high-ranking national security official in President Joe Biden’s White House, applauded the measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would authorize the secretary of commerce to ban applications from six adversarial countries, including China.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But key senators, including the chair and ranking member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and floor leaders of each party, have not signed on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Civil libertarians on both the far left of the Democratic Party and the far right of the Republican Party have voiced their disapproval, Jenna Leventoff, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also lacks support from some senators who favor TikTok bans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri Republican Josh Hawley, the sponsor of </span><a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/HEY23051.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to explicitly ban TikTok, said in a March 29 </span><a href="https://twitter.com/HawleyMO/status/1641247009209286657?lang=en" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the Warner-Thune measure does not go far enough</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem with the RESTRICT Act is — it doesn’t ban TikTok,” he wrote. “It gives the President a whole bunch of new authority and does nothing to stop the CCP. Just ban TikTok.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the House, the Foreign Affairs Committee approved </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1153/text" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by its chairman, Texas Republican Michael McCaul. But no Democrats voted for the measure in committee. A party-line vote could send the measure through the House, but it would need bipartisan support to pass the Senate. </span><b></b></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How would the bans work?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not entirely clear, but a ban would likely involve blocking companies like Apple and Google from offering TikTok in their app store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two leading bills would take different regulatory approaches — the Senate version would go through the Commerce Department, while the House bill provides authority to the Treasury Department, for example — but users would likely see similar effects under either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile device makers can approve or reject applications from appearing in app stores. Removing TikTok from those sources would keep users from downloading the app. Those who already have the app on their devices would see its usability decrease over time as updates could not be installed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the technical uncertainty about how exactly a ban would play out was among the Democratic criticisms of the House bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re being asked to rush this bill through committee with no input from sanction experts, technologists, the business community or even the regulatory agencies who would be in charge of enforcing a ban,” Arizona Democrat Greg Stanton said at a March 1 markup of the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline said he was sympathetic to the national security concerns, but said the measure was “not well-written” and lacked “definitions about critical components.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is broad and maybe universal support on this committee to do exactly what this bill intends to do, but this is incredibly important that it be done right,” Cicilline said. “We all want very much to give the administration the tools that it needs, but in its current form — without a lot of amplification and a lot of definitions — it’s difficult for me to support this.”</span><b></b></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Didn’t Trump already try this?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump did issue an executive order in 2020 under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to ban TikTok, citing many of the same concerns members have recently brought. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal court struck down that order because under the law he cited, the president did not have authority to ban the app. Amendments to that law, enacted in 1988 and 1994, prevented presidents from regulating  “information and informational materials,” such as books, movies or digital media.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The judge did not rule on the First Amendment concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Thune-Warner bill was written specifically to make such an order compliant with the IEEPA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The RESTRICT Act responds to foreign-adversary technology threats of today by giving the force of law to former President Trump’s nearly identical effort, and it prepares for the threats of the future so the United States isn’t forced to play Whac-A-Mole every time a platform like TikTok rears its ugly head,” Thune said in a statement.</span><b></b></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Is any of this constitutional? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That will be the subject of debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a March 29 response to Hawley’s Senate floor speech, Kentucky Republican Rand Paul said proposals to ban an app that fostered free expression mirrored China’s own TikTok ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The First Amendment protects even unpopular speech. Hawley’s bill to ban the app would violate the free speech rights of both the owners of TikTok, some of whom are American, and the app’s users, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do we really want to emulate Chinese speech bans?” Paul said. “We don’t ban things that are unpopular in this country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley responded that the First Amendment did not protect espionage, which he said TikTok enabled the Chinese government to conduct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A complete ban can only be consistent with the First Amendment if it is a response to immediate and significant harm and there is no less restrictive way to respond, Leventoff said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That test is not going to be met,” she said. “We don’t have any evidence of an immediate and significant harm. And even if we did have that evidence, it’s hard to argue that banning TikTok is the least restrictive solution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While TikTok is sometimes described as a platform where young users share dance videos and other unserious content, political speech is also plentiful on the app, Leventoff said, making a nationwide ban even more dangerous from a free speech perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We view this as an extremely important component of speech,” she said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called Wednesday for the federal authority responsible for determining the causes of transportation casualties to investigate the safety culture at all major North American freight railroads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the Feb. 3 Norfolk Southern derailment that caused a toxic chemical spill in East Palestine, Ohio, Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in </span><a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/leader_schumer_ntsb_letter_31523.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy that the board should investigate safety practices at the seven Class I freight railroads operating in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nationwide network of the seven largest freight railroads – BNSF, Canadian National, Canadian Pacific, CSX, Kansas City Southern, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific – operates across the United States. (While Norfolk Southern was traditionally headquartered in Norfolk, Va., it announced it was decamping to Atlanta in 2018.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schumer criticized the industry for lobbying for deregulation and asked the board to analyze if those efforts have increased derailments. He also asked NTSB to determine if railroads ignore their own safety best practices and to issue recommendations for regulations that could reduce future incidents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am hopeful that if the NTSB executes a comprehensive and rigorous investigation into the safety practices and culture at all Class I railroads, you can assure Americans that freight rail safety will dramatically improve,” Schumer wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter singled out a regulation on notifications related to trains carrying hazardous or flammable material, asking if it made sense that such trains only of a certain size should have to notify local communities.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for the agency said it had no immediate response Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t really have much to say other than we appreciate the leader’s commitment to safety,” NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway said in a phone interview. “We are reviewing the letter and we’ll respond to him.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Focus on profits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In remarks on the Senate floor, Schumer said a “questionable safety culture” at Norfolk Southern was at least partially to blame for the East Palestine derailment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Railroads’ focus on profits had led to a lax safety culture in the industry generally, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seven Class I railroads made $22 billion in profits in the first nine months of last year, while spending $25 billion on dividends and stock buybacks, </span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/dec/08/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-correct-railroads-net-billions-vast/#sources" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politfact reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing company reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last five years, accidents involving the largest freight railroads caused 2,768 deaths, while the railroads have cut 20% of their workforce, Schumer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Norfolk Southern is just one example of a dangerous, industry-wide trend within the rail industry that puts profits over people’s safety,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives for the American Association of Railroads, the industry’s advocacy group in Washington, did not return a message seeking comment Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NTSB </span><a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/RRD23MR005.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is already investigating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Norfolk Southern derailment, which, with its toxic chemicals leaking into a community, </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/norfolk-southern-ceo-apologizes-ohio-crash-wont-back-bipartisan-rail-safety-bill-1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has drawn considerable interest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the public and lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board should expand that investigation to look at all Class I railroads, Schumer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But such a large-scale investigation as Schumer suggested would be unusual for the NTSB, which usually examines individual incidents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the recommendations that come from an incident report can have a nationwide reach, it’s rare for the agency to conduct a nationwide inquiry into essentially an entire industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last investigation to focus broadly on an organization’s safety culture was the 2014 probe of Metro North in the New York area following five major accidents on its tracks, Holloway said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Board approves merger </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the NTSB decides to take up Schumer’s request, it could be investigating six railroads instead of seven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also Wednesday, the Surface Transportation Board, a federal commission that oversees the rail industry, <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2023/03/15/federal-government-approves-31-billion-railroad-merger/" target="_blank">approved the merger</a> of the two smallest Class I railroads, Canadian Pacific Railway and Kansas City Southern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Sam Graves, a Republican from Missouri, applauded the move in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This merger has enormous potential to promote increased competition among railroads and other transportation modes, improve commerce and access to markets, and streamline domestic and cross-border movement of goods,” Graves said. “This is especially critical at a time when delays and backlogs continue to trouble our Nation’s supply chain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have been more skeptical. Warren said in a March 3 letter that the merger would reduce competition, eliminate jobs and increase shipping costs.</span></p>

(Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government will send $2.5 billion over the next five years to states, local governments and tribes to build electric vehicle charging infrastructure, Biden administration officials said Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grant program, which was authorized by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, will spend $2.5 billion over five years to build electric vehicle charging stations and refueling infrastructure for hydrogen, propane or natura gas vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Administration officials told reporters in a press call Monday the program would help President Joe Biden meet his goal of 500,000 public charging stations by the end of the decade. Officials briefed reporters on the condition they would not be named.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden has also set a goal of reducing national greenhouse gas emissions by at least half by 2030. Gas-powered vehicles account for about one-quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grant funding will be evenly split between designated </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/alternative_fuel_corridors/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alternative-fuel corridors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and public facilities like parking lots, schools and parks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With today’s announcement, we are taking another big step forward in creating an EV future that is convenient, affordable, reliable, and accessible to all Americans,” U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applications for the first two years of funding, which will include $700 million in grants, </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/cfi/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened Tuesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and are due by May 30. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grant program adds to other recent federal spending on electric vehicle charging stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each state will also receive a share of a separate $1.5 billion fund the federal government made available for charging stations last year. Each state developed a plan for building an electric vehicle charging network. The Federal Highway Administration, the Transportation Department agency that administers federal highway funding to states, approved each state plan last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States will not have to apply for grants to receive funding under that program, instead receiving funding based on a predetermined formula that factors in things like population and miles of road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the administration finalized standards for charging stations, including a requirement that components will eventually have to be sourced in the United States. Most material needed for electric vehicle charging stations is not yet available domestically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden began his State of the Union address Tuesday — his first to a divided Congress — with an appeal to bipartisan priorities, but later criticized parts of the GOP agenda and got a sense of Republicans’ appetite for conflict during one combative stretch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden opened the 72-minute speech with an olive branch to congressional Republicans, listing several items he’d worked with the party on over the past two years. He highlighted laws passed to spend $1.2 trillion on infrastructure, boost semiconductor manufacturing and make electoral reforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also called for congressional Republicans to work with Democrats and his administration for the next two years. Expanding access to opioid-related addiction treatment and strengthening the fight against </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-state-union-speech-call-bipartisan-action-fentanyl-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fentanyl trafficking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as blocking overcharges on items like resort and airline fees, should be bipartisan priorities, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Biden also commended Democratic laws that passed without Republican support and pledged to veto several policies favored by some Republicans, including a nationwide abortion ban and the repeal of a bill that caps the price of insulin for Medicare recipients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he called for legislation Republicans may be unlikely to support, including a bill to protect LGBTQ Americans under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of the death of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, at the hands of Memphis, Tennessee, police, Biden proposed a renewed focus on police reforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden in discussing debt limit negotiations blasted GOP members’ willingness to allow the U.S. to default on its debt to force spending cuts and a proposal to force a vote to reauthorize Social Security and Medicare every five years — inciting cries of outrage from many Republicans present, most prominently Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You lie! Liar!” shouted Greene, as many GOP lawmakers booed and yelled “No!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP U.S. Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin have endorsed requiring periodic votes to continue Social Security and Medicare. Biden didn’t mention the senators by name Tuesday, and acknowledged that they were perhaps a minority of their party. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some Republicans in the U.S. House chamber Tuesday booed at the perceived attack, prompting Biden to declare the programs safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I&#8217;m glad to see it,” he said. “I enjoy conversion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers also shouted at Biden about illicit fentanyl entering the U.S. over the Southwest border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year,” Biden said after recognizing New Hampshire father Doug Griffin, whose 20-year-old daughter died of a drug overdose in 2014. Griffith was invited as a guest of the first lady.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s your fault,” several GOP members yelled.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unity agenda</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden emphasized his work on bipartisan issues, saying he passed 300 bills in the last two years that had support from both parties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those measures include a reauthorization of a law to strengthen enforcement of violence against women, a law to recognize same-sex marriages, a law to tweak the electoral process and the infrastructure law he championed. That law helped fund airport improvements in Atlanta and Portland, Oregon, among 20,000 other projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He highlighted a few issues that he thought both parties could work to address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following another year of record drug overdose deaths, Biden for the second year in a row highlighted battling the opioid crisis as one of the main pillars of his “Unity Agenda” — policy areas where the president says both parties can join together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden promised to increase drug detection machines at the border, to work with carriers like FedEx to inspect more packages and to enforce strong penalties for traffickers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials seized nearly 15,000 pounds of illicit fentanyl last year,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">with the vast majority coming into the U.S. via land border crossings, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden vowed to work with Congress to more strictly classify illicit synthetic fentanyl-related substances under the Controlled Substances Act, a proposal that has been re-introduced this Congress. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veterans, mental health</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also falling under Biden’s Unity Agenda: combating homelessness and pressing health issues for America’s veterans, and addressing the nation’s mental health crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president touted </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/08/10/biden-signs-landmark-bill-aiding-veterans-exposed-to-burn-pits-overseas/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bipartisan law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that expands benefits for veterans who were exposed to open burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq, Agent Orange in Vietnam, and other toxic substances in other geographic theaters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veteran homelessness fell by 11% last year, according to the White House, and the Veterans Affairs Department is slated to expand mental health resources, including establishing peer-to-peer support programs and hiring more clinicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The call for improving veteran health care was a rare part of the speech that won compliments from Republican members. Senate Veterans’ Affairs ranking Republican Jerry Moran of Kansas praised Biden for signing the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Supporting our veterans is a mission that should always break through the gridlock in Congress,” Moran said in a post-address statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Republican U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson also said she was encouraged by Biden’s reference to veteran mental health and pledged to work toward it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health resources for everyday Americans, including students, are also expanding, Biden said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden touted the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act that created grants for schools to establish trauma-informed youth mental health programs and other health services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 law was brokered by a bipartisan group of 20 senators last summer in the evenly divided Senate following the May mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that claimed the lives of 19 students and two teachers.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Finish the job’</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden also commended bills Democrats passed without Republicans, especially the landmark climate, health and taxes legislation that passed along party lines last year. He vowed to fight any effort to undo them and to “finish the job” on some contentious policy areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republicans wanted to repeal the climate, health and taxes law, he said, pledging to veto any such reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That law capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for Medicare patients. He called for Congress to expand that cap to people on private insurance plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive,” Biden said. “Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make, but, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars — and making record profits. Not anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also called for more resources to fight climate change, which he called “an existential threat” that affects Republican and Democratic states alike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he called for a “billionaire minimum tax” to require wealthy people be taxed at a rate no lower than working-class professions and closing more tax loopholes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress should also pass a ban on assault weapons, he said, bringing sustained applause from Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, with the family of 29-year-old Nichols, who died after being brutally beaten by Memphis police, in the audience, Biden asked Congress to “finish the job” on police reform.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Police reform</h4>

	
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/whos-guest-list-state-union-speech" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the many guests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, the mother and stepfather of Nichols, who were invited by the White House and Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford of Nevada, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They had to bury Tyre last week,” Biden said as the couple stood. “As many of you personally know, there’s no words to describe the heartache or grief of losing a child. But imagine, imagine if you lost that child at the hands of the law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nichols’ death last month just three days after his beating by police has renewed calls from Democrats and the White House for </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/02/03/congressional-black-caucus-meets-with-biden-to-push-for-police-accountability/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">police reform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden called for more training for police and to hold them to a higher standard, and for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a bill that passed the House twice when it was under Democratic control. The bill faltered in the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just like every cop when they pin on that badge in the morning has a right to be able to go home at night, so does everybody else out there. Our children have a right to come home safely,” Biden said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that “when police officers or police departments violate the public trust, they must be held accountable.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economy and democracy</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden extolled progress he said the country has made since he came into office two years ago on issues related to the economic recovery from the pandemic and on defending democratic norms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He touted a strong economic recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic, including job growth and a record-low unemployment rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy added more than 500,000 jobs last month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">January report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The national unemployment of 3.4% is a 50-year low, Biden said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The story of America is a story of progress and resilience,” he said in the opening minutes of the speech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Two years ago, our economy was reeling. As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs — more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years. Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much. Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average price of gas has dropped $1.50 since its peak last summer, Biden said. Republicans often note it is still higher than when he took office.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Oil production</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden also called on U.S. oil companies to produce more domestic oil, prompting laughs from the GOP side of the aisle. Republicans have routinely criticized the president for policies they say have discouraged oil and gas production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden also praised the condition of U.S. democracy. He came into office mere weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. While that event remained a stain on the nation, Biden said similar attempts to subvert the nation’s system of government have not followed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War,” he said. “Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, he called the current moment “an inflection point” and noted the danger of political violence like that committed against Paul Pelosi, the husband of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was in the chamber as a guest of first lady Jill Biden.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shouts of opposition</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Biden’s calls for unity and Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s promise that GOP lawmakers would remain civil during the address, several outbursts could be heard from the Republican side.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34365" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:429px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-34365" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="429" height="286" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1463971699-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene gives a thumbs down during President Joe Biden&#8217;s State of the Union address. The Georgia Republican shouted at Biden at various times during the speech. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the loudest and most raucous moments was when Biden accused some in the GOP of wanting to cut entitlement programs as part of a negotiation to raise the debt ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage — I get it — unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what those plans are,” Biden said. “Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That led to shouts from Greene and others, which evoked then-U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson’s outburst during a joint address to Congress by President Barack Obama in 2009. Wilson’s episode was considered a shocking breach of decorum, and he apologized for it that night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Greene doubled down in a video posted to social media following the speech, and none in her party rushed to criticize the Georgia firebrand, demonstrating how difficult Biden’s call for bipartisanship will be to realize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene also called out to Biden “China spied on us” at the mention of the rival nation. The Georgia Republican carried an inflated white balloon through the halls of Congress shortly before Biden’s address, using the stunt to draw attention to the </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/chinese-surveillance-balloon-now-drifting-across-middle-us-pentagon-confirms" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese surveillance balloon spotted across the U.S. last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and shot down by the Air Force just off the coast of South Carolina Saturday.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ukraine funding request</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the one-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine approaches, defending the Eastern European nation again featured in Biden’s address. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year’s State of the Union occurred just days after Russia’s February 2022 attack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pentagon has directed just over $29 billion in defense and security assistance for Ukraine in the past twelve months, including a roughly $2 billion weapons package Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden pledged to continue supporting Ukraine “as long as it takes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Putin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America, a test for the world. Would we stand for the most basic of principles? Would we stand for sovereignty? Would we stand for the right of people to live free or tyranny? Would we stand for the defense of democracy?” Biden said. “&#8230; One year later we know the answer, yes we would and we did.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both sides of the chamber rose to their feet and applauded when a moment later Biden pointed up to the gallery to recognize Ukraine ambassador Oksana Markarova.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">National abortion ban</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden made a brief mention of abortion rights in the first State of the Union after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year overturning Roe v. Wade. He noted that more than a dozen states began enforcing “extreme abortion bans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress should pass a law to reinstate nationwide abortion rights, he said, adding that he would veto a national abortion ban, if it passed.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reactions from GOP hostile</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Congress’ reception to the address fell along predictable party lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressional Democrats largely praised the effort, including the sections on jobs, abortion rights, clean energy and health care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Republicans also found much to criticize. Some statements indicated no speech Biden could have given would have won them over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“President Biden is filled with more hot air than the China spy balloon,” House Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said in a statement. “Deflate the rhetoric and the facts reveal President Biden’s policies have created crises on every front.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the Republican agenda in Biden’s first two years in Congress and the states has focused on classroom teachings about racism in the U.S., transgender rights, abortion and other cultural issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders focused on those issues in </span><a href="https://www.republicanleader.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/governor-sarah-huckabee-sanders-delivers-republican-address-to-the-nation?peek=BU3JzdrGjQ/D6eoEmf7alu2MlhP8pf22KNN/D8Zpz47IzP2v" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the official GOP response.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,” she said. “Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — The White House revealed Thursday morning that more classified documents from President Joe Biden’s time as vice president were discovered outside of secure government facilities, this time in the garage at his Wilmington, Delaware home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The files have since been turned over to the U.S. Justice Department, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opened a special counsel investigation into the matter. Another set of documents with classified markings also dating to the Obama administration were discovered earlier at a think tank associated with Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, speaking Thursday afternoon, said he’d appointed former federal prosecutor Robert Hur to lead the investigation to determine if Biden had mishandled classified material. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This appointment underscores for the public the department&#8217;s commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters, and to making decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law,” Garland said. “I am confident that Mr. Hur will carry out his responsibility in an even-handed and urgent manner, and in accordance with the highest traditions of this department.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hur was appointed in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump to lead the federal prosecutor’s office in Maryland and joined the law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher in April 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden expanded on the developments during brief remarks Thursday morning following a speech on the economy, saying his lawyers “discovered a small number of documents with classified markings in storage areas and file cabinets in my home and in my personal library.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden added, while being questioned by reporters, that the garage, where he also stores his classic Corvettes, was locked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the way, my Corvettes [are] in a locked garage. It’s not like they’re sitting out on the street,” Biden said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Second discovery</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The finding of additional classified documents was announced in a written statement by Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president. The disclosure came after documents with classified markings were found at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C., in November 2022, and the president’s lawyers began searching his residences in Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those lawyers found “a small number of additional Obama-Biden Administration records with classified markings,” according to Sauber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All but one of these documents were found in storage space in the President’s Wilmington residence garage,” Sauber said. “One document consisting of one page was discovered among stored materials in an adjacent room. No documents were found in the Rehoboth Beach residence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawyers immediately contacted the Department of Justice and arranged to turn over the documents, Sauber said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Garland’s remarks, Sauber said Biden and his legal team “will continue that cooperation with the Special Counsel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are confident that a thorough review will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the President and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake,” Sauber added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department received notice from Biden’s personal attorney on Dec. 20 that the additional classified documents had been found, Garland said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden in his remarks reiterated that he respects the federal government’s classification process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As I said earlier this week, people know I take classified documents and classified materials seriously,” Biden said. “I also said we’re cooperating fully with the Justice Department&#8217;s review.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garland laid out a timeline of when the department learned of the classified documents. The National Archives Office of the Inspector General first notified the Justice Department on Nov. 4 that documents were stored at the Penn Biden Center, Garland said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump comparisons</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discovery of classified documents in Biden’s private residence, not just an office he used after his time as vice president, immediately drew comparisons to the classified documents found inside Trump’s private residence at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those documents were, however, only recovered by the government after the FBI secured a search warrant for parts of his property amid an ongoing struggle by the National Archives to get back all of the classified documents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal authorities are </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/search-warrant-shows-trump-under-investigation-possible-espionage-act-violations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigating Trump for possible Espionage Act violations </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">because of classified documents he took from the White House to Mar-a-Lago. The FBI executed a search of his residence in August, finding about 100 classified documents out of 11,000 total documents, the Justice Department </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-justice-department-appeal-trump-special-master-order" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search followed Trump’s return to the National Archives of documents, including 184 with classified markings, that had been held at Mar-a-Lago after he left the White House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Republicans seized upon the Biden revelations. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, rebuked Biden for keeping the documents with classified markings at an office and his personal residence in Delaware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think Congress has to investigate this,” McCarthy said. “Here’s an individual that’s been in office for more than 40 years, here&#8217;s an individual that said on ‘60 Minutes’ that [he] was so concerned about President Trump’s documents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy added: “I do not think any American believes that justice should not be equal to all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden answered questions about the documents just after a speech on the U.S. economy, where he was hoping to focus on low unemployment and reduced inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The data is clear, even though inflation is high in major economies around the world, it is coming down in America month after month,” Biden said. </span></p>

(Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in a historic vote agreed unanimously Monday to refer former President Donald Trump and others to the Justice Department for potential criminal charges, including inciting or aiding an insurrection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump associates, including attorneys John Eastman and Kenneth Chesebro and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, a former Republican House member from North Carolina, likely also played criminal roles, the panel said in an </span><a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/Introductory%20Material%20to%20the%20Final%20Report%20of%20the%20Select%20Committee.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive summary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its final report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel referred four House Republicans to the House Ethics Committee for refusing to testify: Andy Biggs of Arizona, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and California’s Kevin McCarthy, who is likely to become the next speaker when Republicans take control of the House in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before taking the unprecedented step of referring a former president for criminal charges, the bipartisan panel recapped in its final public meeting its findings that Trump engaged in a multipart plan to overturn the 2020 presidential election, culminating in the deadly attack on the Capitol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department, which is already investigating Trump’s conduct related to the 2020 election, will determine how to pursue the referrals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a post to his own social media network on Monday, Truth Social, Trump promoted a Dec. 9 post that linked to his video on Jan. 6 telling supporters to leave the Capitol. Committee members said that video came after more than three hours of inaction as Trump watched the attack.</span></p>
<p>Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, in <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1604964845773881344" target="_blank">a tweet</a> Monday evening called Jan. 6 &#8220;a crime with lasting implications for democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Jan. 6 [Committee] has put in countless hours to get to the bottom of what happened &amp; I trust that any decisions on criminal referrals are rooted in the facts uncovered by this thorough investigation,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Four counts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee’s seven Democrats and two Republicans all voted to refer Trump for criminal charges on four counts: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obstructing an official proceeding;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conspiring to defraud the United States;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conspiring to make a false statement; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inciting, assisting or aiding an insurrection.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members said Trump claimed victory despite knowing he lost the election, pressured state and federal officials to promote his lie that the election results were fraudulent, summoned his supporters to the nation’s capital on Jan. 6, 2021, and incited them to attempt to violently block the certification of election results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump then sat in the White House dining room and watched as the attack unfolded, members of the panel said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His actions violated a core principle of U.S. government, the two-century tradition of a peaceful transition of power, committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;At the heart of our republic is the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power,” Cheney said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every president in our history has defended this orderly transfer of authority, except one. Jan. 6, 2021, was the first time one American president refused his constitutional duty to transfer power peacefully to the next. … The Select Committee has recognized our obligation to do everything we can to ensure this never happens again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee released the 154-page executive summary Monday, though the full report is not expected to be made public until later this week.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ethics Committee referral</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panel also referred Biggs, Jordan, Perry and McCarthy to their chamber’s ethics panel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those members “had materially relevant communications” with Trump on Jan. 6 and the days leading up to the attack and withheld that information from the panel, the committee said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email, a spokesman for Jordan dismissed the accusation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is just another partisan and political stunt made by” the committee, Jordan spokesman Russell M. Dye wrote Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives for Biggs, Perry and McCarthy did not immediately return messages seeking comment Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be up to the ethics panel, which is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, to decide whether to proceed with an inquiry into the four members who were named. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Masterminds and ringleaders’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said Trump violated the basis of U.S. democracy and that criminal referrals are important to seek accountability and ensure that a similar insurrection is never attempted again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Evidence we&#8217;ve gathered points to further action beyond the power of this committee or the Congress to help ensure accountability under law, accountability that can only be found in the criminal justice system,” Thompson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While hundreds of Trump supporters who mobbed the Capitol that day have been charged, U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and committee member, said Trump should also face charges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a pass,” he said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fake electors</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee’s recommendation for two of the criminal charges, conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to make a false statement, centered on the scheme to use slates of false electors from states that Trump lost in 2020. Those states were Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2022/06/29/updated-trumps-fake-electors-heres-the-full-list/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 84 Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including dozens of party leaders, signed on to the bogus documents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These intentionally false documents were transmitted to multiple officers of the federal government and were intended to interfere with the proper conduct of the joint session, where the existence of so-called competing slates of electors would serve as a pretext for legitimate electoral votes to be rejected,” said U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement following the panel’s meeting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the committee’s work and appeared to call for the Justice Department to prosecute Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With painstaking detail, this executive summary documents the sinister plot to subvert the Congress, shred the Constitution and halt the peaceful transfer of power,” Pelosi said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The committee has reached important conclusions about the evidence it has developed, and I respect those findings. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our founders made clear that, in the United States of America, no one is above the law. This bedrock principle remains unequivocally true, and justice must be done.”</span></p>

(Scott Elmquist/Style Weekly)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The annual Defense Department policy bill members of Congress released late Tuesday did not include measures to loosen federal marijuana restrictions, to the disappointment of advocates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leaves few avenues to pass marijuana measures seen as boons to states where the drug is legal before Congress adjourns for the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of the last must-pass bills Congress would consider while Democrats still control both chambers, the defense bill was a potential target for advocates of legalizing marijuana interested in attaching two bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One would clarify that banks lending to legitimate marijuana businesses in states with legal markets are not in violation of federal law. The other would provide federal funding to help states expunge criminal records of people convicted of offenses before the substance was made legal in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the bulk of the defense bill deals with authorizing Pentagon programs, it is often filled with additional policy measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when 4,400 pages of text for </span><a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/democrats.rules.house.gov/files/BILLS-117HR7776EAS-RCP117-70.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the 2022 bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were released Tuesday night, neither marijuana proposal was included.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With less than two weeks left in the session, the path to passage is now either as part of a year-end spending bill — another popular target for legislation — or on its own, Morgan Fox, the political director for the cannabis advocacy group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad that we still have other options,” Fox said Wednesday. “It’s pretty disappointing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A vote on a standalone marijuana bill is unlikely, with the Senate in session only a handful of days this year and a list of priorities remaining, including the year-long government funding bill and a measure to clarify election laws.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Split with states</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the federal government places marijuana on its list of most restricted controlled substances, 21 states have legalized recreational use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That policy split leads to unique challenges for state-legal businesses in areas like banking, where some financial institutions refuse to work with the marijuana industry out of fear they will violate federal law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The banking </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1996" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, introduced by U.S. Rep. Ed Perlmutter, a Colorado Democrat retiring at the end of the year, would clarify that federal regulators could not penalize banks for doing business with marijuana retailers operating in compliance with their states’ laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The banking bill has passed the House seven times since its first introduction in 2019, but the Senate has never passed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The streak in the House may be in danger as Republicans take over next year. Despite its bipartisan support and a </span><a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2021120" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">321-101 vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in favor last year, the legislation could face long odds next year if Ohio Republican Jim Jordan becomes chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, as expected. Jordan has consistently voted against marijuana legalization efforts, including against the banking bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, an advocate of liberalizing marijuana laws, told reporters before the defense bill’s text was released Tuesday he was working on getting the banking measure passed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a priority for me,” Schumer said. “I’d like to get it done. We’ll try and discuss the best way to get it done.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, opposed including marijuana provisions in the defense bill, listing the banking bill as an item that did not belong there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re talking about a grab bag of miscellaneous pet priorities — making our financial system more sympathetic to illegal drugs,” he said. “If Democrats wanted these controversial items so badly, they had two years to move them across the floor.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Colorado support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill is a priority for states where legal marijuana businesses constitute major industries, such as Colorado, where marijuana sales started in 2014 and reached $2.2 billion last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a written statement, Conor Cahill, a spokesman for Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, commended Perlmutter for his work and predicted passage this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Governor Polis has long advocated for the passage of the SAFE Banking Act, and has repeatedly called upon Congress to pass this important legislation to protect cannabis-related businesses, support minority, women, and veteran-owned small businesses owners, create jobs, and strengthen public safety in Colorado communities and in the states,” Cahill wrote in a Tuesday email. “We hope and expect to see the final passage of his decade-long effort by the end of the lame-duck session.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schumer resisted bringing the banking bill to the floor this Congress as he sought to instead pass a broader federal legalization </span><a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-schumer-wyden-introduce-cannabis-administration-and-opportunity-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he introduced with fellow Senate Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey and Ron Wyden of Oregon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although the SAFE Banking Act is common-sense policy that I support, it has to be coupled with strong restorative justice provisions that seek to right the many injustices experienced by Black and brown communities as part of our nation’s failed war on drugs,” Booker said in a statement </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-law-still-treats-marijuana-illegal-drug-creating-headaches-states" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for Booker did not return a message seeking comment Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schumer’s advocacy would be crucial to passage, Fox said, though the deference to a more comprehensive bill may have hurt its chances this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Having support of Senate leadership I think was really important,” Fox said. “I wish they’d gotten the ball rolling on this way earlier in the session, instead of waiting until after the (Schumer-Booker-Wyden bill) was introduced.”</span></p>

<p>The U.S. House moved Wednesday to avoid an economically disastrous nationwide rail strike, voting to codify an agreement that members of some unions had already rejected and separately add paid sick leave that workers had demanded.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-track approach allows Democrats to avert a strike that could cost the U.S. economy up to $2 billion per day, while also acknowledging they sympathized with union members’ request for more sick leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prospects in the Senate, where progressive stalwart Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, and other members of the Democratic caucus have asked that sick leave be added to any deal imposed by Congress, remained murky Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the House votes closed Wednesday, Sanders was on the Senate floor urging support for the sick leave proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I hope very much that in a bipartisan way we can do the right thing and tell the rail workers and tell every worker in America that the United States Congress is prepared to stand with them and not just the people on top who are doing extraordinarily well,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Republicans have also signaled their support for adding sick leave, but it’s unclear if there are the 10 Republicans needed to approve that measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The congressional action comes after President Joe Biden convened a panel of arbitrators to secure a deal between railroads and union leaders in September. That deal provided a 24% increase in total compensation to rail workers but did not affect sick leave policies that unions said were unworkable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four of the 12 rail unions declined to endorse the deal. They are legally able to strike on Dec. 9, though rail service is likely to be affected if a work stoppage is not avoided by week’s end. Thousands of businesses would feel the impact in the weeks before the holidays.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats say they must act</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden, who fashioned himself “a proud pro-labor president,” said this week he would have preferred not to wade into the dispute, but that the economic consequences necessitated federal action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am reluctant to override the ratification procedures and the views of those who voted against the agreement,” he said. “But in this case — where the economic impact of a shutdown would hurt millions of other working people and families — I believe Congress must use its powers to adopt this deal.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Democrats took similar positions this week, appearing reluctant to approve a deal that unions had rejected, but doing so anyway to avoid economic catastrophe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Congress has the authority to act,” U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen, a Washington Democrat who is a senior member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said Wednesday. “Not because we want to, but we have to avoid a work stoppage. And we have to recognize that the tentative agreement falls well short of what is necessary for paid leave for rail workers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans took the opportunity to blast Biden for failing to avert the rail shutdown with the September negotiation. Congress shouldn’t have to be involved, they said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Congress should be a last resort,” U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican of Iowa, said. “Biden and this administration, they need to be more engaged in this. This is not our business. We shouldn’t be negotiating union contracts.”</span></p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Bob Good, a Republican from Virginia, tweeted early Wednesday afternoon before the House vote: &#8220;Republicans should not provide any votes for the Biden railroad bill. Doing so gives Democrats the chance to amend the deal and make it worse.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Bipartisan vote</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday’s </span><a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022490" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">290-137</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> House vote to </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hjres100/BILLS-117hjres100ih.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approve the tentative agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — without added sick time — was bipartisan, with only eight Democrats voting against and more than one-third of Republicans voting to approve it. </span></p>
<p>All of Virginia&#8217;s House delegation and Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith voted for the bill. Good, as well as Republican Reps. Ben Cline and Rob Wittman, voted against it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote to </span><a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20221128/BILLS-117-hconres119ih.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">add the sick leave provision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed </span><a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022491" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">221-207</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, mostly along party lines, with three Republicans — Don Bacon of Nebraska, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and John Katko of New York — joining all House Democrats in voting to approve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoiding a rail shutdown should be the priority, House Transportation and Infrastructure ranking Republican Sam Graves of Missouri said, not mollifying union members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress stepping in to override private negotiations and the recommendation of a neutral mediation board undermined future collective bargaining, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s nothing more than a political stunt,” Graves said. “It’s pandering &#8230; Today my colleagues are acting very recklessly and are setting a terrible precedent.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Donald Payne, the New Jersey Democrat who chairs the panel’s rail subcommittee, responded that the proposal would only right the wrong of rail workers’  insufficient paid sick leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not pandering,” Payne responded. “This is seeing a situation and addressing it.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Uncertainty in Senate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After House passage, the measure will move to the Senate, where it’s unclear if the tentative agreement, the resolution with added sick time or neither would pass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chamber will likely vote either Thursday or Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado’s John Hickenlooper was among the Senate Democrats joining Sanders in calling for seven days of added sick leave — the same amount required of federal contractors —to be included in a congressional resolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Railroad companies are holding the American economy hostage over 56 annual hours of sick leave,” Hickenlooper said in a statement. “Just seven days. We can keep our economy humming, our supply chains open, AND treat workers with dignity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any bill should include the SEVEN days of sick leave rail workers have asked for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Republicans gave varying levels of support to the prospect of adding sick leave to a bill. Ten would be needed to pass such a bill if every Democrat voted in favor. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin III, considered the caucus’ most conservative member, has not said how he would vote on the sick leave proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ernst said her party was “debating this heavily.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since Congress is involved, she said she would base her vote on the views of union members — not necessarily their leaders. Union leaders negotiated the September agreement that lacked all the sick time members sought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Florida Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott said </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-sens-rick-scott-marco-rubio-wont-support-congressional-action-stop-potential-rail-strike" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they wouldn’t vote for</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the tentative agreement that was opposed by workers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders of the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO, a major transportation union, on Wednesday morning prior to the vote endorsed the bill to add seven days of sick leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, every Member of Congress has an opportunity to be a champion of the working class,” TTD President Greg Regan and Secretary-Treasurer Shari Semelsberger said in a statement. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We implore these elected leaders to stand with essential workers who are the backbone of our nation’s supply chain. We urge the House and the Senate to vote in favor of guaranteeing seven days of paid sick leave to rail workers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Biden thanked the House for passing its bill and called on the Senate to follow suit “immediately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without action this week, disruptions to our auto supply chains, our ability to move food to tables, and our ability to remove hazardous waste from gasoline refineries will begin,” he said. “The Senate must move quickly and send a bill to my desk for my signature immediately.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">$2 billion per day</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Association of American Railroads, the trade group for the leading rail service providers, estimated that a nationwide shutdown would mean daily losses of $2 billion for the U.S. economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tens of thousands of businesses depend on rail to deliver goods, with 75,000 carloads beginning shipping every day, according to a </span><a href="https://www.aar.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AAR-Rail-Shutdown-Report-September-2022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">September AAR report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other industries would not be in a position to replace rail transport, the report said. It would take 467,000 additional long-haul trucks to replace rail carriers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was unanimity among elected officials in Washington that a shutdown would be calamitous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Monday, Biden called on Congress to approve the tentative agreement “to avert a potentially crippling national rail shutdown.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A shutdown is unacceptable,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said at Monday’s press briefing. “It will hurt families, communities across the country. It will hurt jobs. It will hurt farms. It will hurt businesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg also called Monday evening for Congress to adopt the agreement to prevent “a rail shutdown that would have devastating impacts on our economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and Republicans in the House noted that a shutdown would worsen inflation, driving up energy and other costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And because of the complexity of the supply chain, any stoppage in service could take much longer to unfurl, Ed Mortimer, a former vice president for transportation and infrastructure at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any type of disruption — it could only last a week, but it could take a month or two to get back to whatever normal was,” he said.</span></p>

(Photo by Marisa Demarco / Source New Mexico)</p><p>Among the items on Congress’ lengthy to-do list by the end of the year is U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin’s proposal to speed up the federal government’s permitting process that certifies energy projects do not harm the environment.</p>
<p>But the bill, which was a condition of the centrist West Virginia Democrat’s support for his party’s larger climate, health care and taxes measure earlier this year, may still not have the support it needs to pass, with progressive Democrats concerned about the effects on environmental protections.</p>
<p>Failing to pass a bill this year would be a disappointment to Manchin and his allies in the oil, gas and coal sectors, who have pushed for years to loosen federal permitting requirements. Some renewable energy advocates also say that federal permitting must be reformed for wind and solar technology to reach their highest potential.</p>
<p>But it would be welcome news for environmental advocates, who say the bill would weaken a fundamental environmental law that protects communities from pollution, while providing little in the way of new renewable energy capacity.</p>
<p>Congress is expected to be in session through much of December, before adjourning for a new session in January and a split government as Republicans take over the House with a slim majority.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a pretty tight calendar, and they have a lot they have to do,” said Brett Hartl, the government affairs director for the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity, which opposes the Manchin bill, speaking of the lame-duck session of Congress. “So do you spend a lot of time on a piece of legislation that is very deeply divisive?”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environmental justice concerns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Environmental groups, including those in the environmental justice movement that seeks to protect marginalized communities from exposure to pollution, have opposed the bill from the start.</p>
<p>The measure would put time limits on environmental reviews and restrict communities’ power to challenge agency decisions in court.</p>
<p>“Senator Manchin’s legislation is a harbinger for the permanent silencing of environmental justice communities in the permitting process, while also eviscerating the rights to due process in a court of law should they deem it necessary to protect their communities from harm,” 70 environmental justice organizations said in <a href="https://www.weact.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhiteHouse_-PermitReform-1.pdf" target="_blank">a Nov. 15 letter</a> to President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The letter was distributed Monday by U.S. Rep. Raul Grijalva, a progressive Arizona Democrat who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee and has vocally opposed the Manchin bill.</p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/kaine-says-mountain-valley-pipeline-provision-in-manchin-bill-could-open-the-door-to-serious-abuse-and-even-corruption/</p>
<p>The Manchin bill targets requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, demanding that environmental reviews of major projects be completed within two years and all others within one.</p>
<p>Those time limits don’t actually weaken the requirements of the law, but an artificial timeline without additional resources to complete reviews could lead to agencies cutting corners, said Aaron Weiss, the deputy director of the conservation group Center for Western Priorities.</p>
<p>“And when agencies cut corners on NEPA reviews, that’s how they get tied up in court for years,” Weiss said. “So the irony of at least the last Manchin proposal that we saw is it didn&#8217;t seem like it would actually do much to streamline NEPA reviews and, if anything, that it could backfire.”</p>
<p>A major sticking point in the Manchin bill is its provision approving the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a natural gas pipeline in Virginia and West Virginia.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said earlier this year that he opposed the bill because of that section. The pipeline should go through standard environmental reviews, he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Green energy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The permitting bill was part of a deal Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer made with Manchin to secure his support for Democrats’ major climate, health care and taxes bill, which provided $370 billion in clean energy spending.</p>
<p>Schumer said at the time he didn’t love the idea of weakening environmental statutes, but it was a necessary concession to Manchin to pass the larger bill. He also said that reforms could speed clean energy projects.</p>
<p>“In terms of the permitting reform, I didn’t like it, but it was something that Sen. Manchin wanted,” he said in a <a href="https://youtu.be/wxeXUpdtLfE?t=2269" target="_blank">press conference</a> immediately following Senate passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August. “We modified it some and, in fact, it has some very good things for the environment. It’s going to make permitting easier for clean energy.”</p>
<p>But that argument hasn’t caught on completely, as environmental advocates oppose trading away longstanding federal protections for permitting changes that would help both clean energy and fossil fuel production.</p>
<p>“It is pretty naïve to think that if we gut NEPA that the bigger winner would somehow be renewable energy,” said Hartl of the Center for Biological Diversity.</p>
<p>“I think (renewable energy) transmission is important,” said Lisa Frank, the executive director of the Washington office of the environmental group Environment America. “But we don’t see it as this do-or-die moment that we have to pass something by December or a clean energy future is wrecked.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Prospects yet this year</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There are indications Manchin and Schumer are continuing to work to appease the bill’s opponents and pass it this year, likely as an attachment to either a government funding bill or the annual defense authorization.</p>
<p>The White House is supportive. Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during the Nov. 10 White House daily briefing that the defense bill should include Manchin’s permitting proposal.</p>
<p>But the permitting bill remains without critical support in Washington.</p>
<p>“As you saw when we tried it last time, there weren&#8217;t enough Republican votes,” Schumer told reporters Tuesday. “I&#8217;m working with Sen. Manchin to see what we can get done.”</p>
<p>Despite Schumer’s blessing, rank-and-file Democrats, especially on the House side, have largely not endorsed it.</p>
<p>Progressives have well-documented concerns about the bill. Neither progressives nor Republicans have given any indication that they are changing their positions. Grijalva, in the <a href="https://naturalresources.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2022-11-21%20RG%20to%20Leadership%20re%20Permitting.pdf" target="_blank"> Monday letter</a>, reaffirmed his opposition.</p>
<p>Republicans, in theory, should favor a proposal to streamline federal permits. Some Republicans have railed for years at the red tape that slows down and increases the cost of infrastructure building.</p>
<p>A more conclusive victory for Republicans in the midterms may have brought Democrats and environmental groups back to the negotiating table this year to try to hash out a deal — especially on clean energy transmission — before the less environmentally conscious GOP takes over in January, Hartl said.</p>
<p>But with a slim, single-digit majority in the House, Republican Leader and presumptive next House Speaker Kevin McCarthy may be unable to corral votes on a permitting bill, and progressives appear more willing to take their chances.</p>
<p>“The odds of Republican dysfunction and inability to function are extremely high in the next Congress,” Hartl said.</p>
<p>Still, Manchin and Schumer have pulled off surprises before. Most recently, Manchin <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/16/climate-change-legislation-still-could-pass-congress-this-year-manchin-insists/" target="_blank">insisted this summer</a> he was still working on a climate bill that he could support, even as his colleagues in Congress and many other observers blamed his ambivalence for tanking the chances of any legislation to address climate.</p>
<p>He and Schumer emerged within weeks <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/07/27/manchin-and-u-s-senate-democrats-strike-a-deal-on-major-health-climate-tax-package/" target="_blank">with a deal</a> for a major bill.</p>
<p>An individual close to Manchin said in late November that the senator “continues to look for ways to pass it by the end of the year.”</p>
<p>But given the packed agenda — funding the government, authorizing annual military spending, perhaps raising the debt ceiling, and passing a bill to clarify how the Electoral College works — Democrats may prefer to stick to items they agree on, Hartl said.</p>

Trump. (Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead</p><p>The U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol sent <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/20221021%20J6%20Cmte%20Subpeona%20to%20Donald%20Trump.pdf" target="_blank">a subpoena</a> Friday to former President Donald Trump, demanding documents and testimony from the person the panel has said was central in orchestrating a plan to overturn the 2020 election that culminated in the insurrection.</p>
<p>The panel set a deadline of Nov. 14 for Trump to testify at a deposition in person or by video and Nov. 4 for Trump to produce documents related to his and his advisers’ involvement with the Capitol raid and other aspects of the plan to overturn the election.</p>
<p>In a preamble, Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, summarized the committee’s findings in its months-long investigation.</p>
<p>“As demonstrated in our hearings, we have assembled overwhelming evidence, including from dozens of your former appointees and staff, that you personally orchestrated and oversaw a multi-part effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and to obstruct the peaceful transition of power,” the letter reads.</p>
<p>Trump spread false allegations of election fraud, asked U.S. Justice Department officials to lie to support his false claims, and pressured state officials, members of Congress and Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to ratify the election results, among other efforts, Thompson and Cheney wrote.</p>
<p>Trump also summoned tens of thousands of supporters to Washington on Jan. 6, when Congress would be certifying the election results, and, despite knowing they were angry and at least some were armed, encouraged them toward the Capitol, the letter says.</p>
<p>He then refused to intervene, instead sending an incendiary tweet that could have incited further violence against Pence, according to the letter.</p>
<p>The subpoena demands 19 categories of documents related to the election as well as the various efforts to contest it and the attack.</p>
<p>The subpoena asks for communications with any members of Congress, and names U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican.</p>
<p>The committee also seeks communications related to the committee’s work itself. Members of the panel have said Trump and people close to him have contacted witnesses in apparent attempts to dissuade them from offering truthful testimony.</p>
<p>At the panel’s likely <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-be-subpoenaed-jan-6-panel-central-cause-capitol-insurrection" target="_blank">final meeting last week</a>, members approved a resolution granting Thompson the ability to subpoena Trump. Trump in response lashed out at the panel on his social networking site, Truth Social, but did not say whether he would comply with the subpoena.</p>
<p>Thompson did not answer directly when asked after that meeting if he expected Trump to comply.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — Members of Congress are fanning out to every district in the country, leaving the wonky floor debates on Capitol Hill behind for the campaign trail in advance of the crucial Nov. 8 midterm elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are fighting to hold their razor-thin majorities in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, citing two years of victories on infrastructure, climate and prescription drug coverage. Republicans — whose early expectations they’d sweep the House were tempered after a Supreme Court abortion ruling — are trying to convince voters they need to balance the scales by putting them in charge of one or both chambers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP candidates are attempting to tie Democrats to inflation, crime, fears about immigration and </span><a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/bidens-job-approval-rating-the-midterm-elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an unpopular president</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But they’re </span><a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/dc-bureau/republicans-in-congress-shy-away-from-campaigning-on-national-abortion-platform/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shying away</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from talking about a national abortion ban in the wake of the court’s decision to overturn two previous cases declaring abortion a constitutional right — while Democrats are seeking something of a nationwide referendum on abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to the tension in an unusual midterm election, Republican election deniers are </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2022/election-deniers-running-for-office-elections-2022/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in many states. Election officials have </span><a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/08/03/election-officials-at-u-s-senate-hearing-describe-threats-spread-of-misinformation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">described</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">threats and a spread of misinformation. Polls in the tightest races aren&#8217;t giving a clear indication of who voters want in office, often switching from one week to the next or putting both candidates within the margin of error.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The polling uncertainty has left party leaders to funnel as much cash and attention to key races as possible, with Senate battles in Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin drawing the most media and cash. Spending overall is expected to top a record $9.3 billion by the time the election is over</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/cost-of-election?cycle=2020&amp;display=T&amp;infl=N" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Open Secrets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican not up for reelection this year, pegs the chances the GOP regains that chamber as dead even. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in a bunch of close races. I think we have a 50-50 shot of getting the Senate back,” McConnell said the last week of September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McConnell sidestepped a question during the same press conference about whether he was being “overly dismissive” about the role abortion might play with suburban women, who tend to swing between voting for Democrats and Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that issue is playing out in different ways in different states,” McConnell said, countering that the three biggest national issues Republicans will pound away at during the campaign will be “inflation, crime and open borders.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voting on abortion? Or inflation?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kansas </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a state dominated by Republicans </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/08/02/kansas-voters-defeat-abortion-amendment-in-unexpected-landslide-1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">residents overwhelmingly voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this summer to reject a constitutional amendment that would have allowed state lawmakers to enact abortion restrictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s been the only ballot question about abortion since the Supreme Court’s ruling in June, though California, Kentucky, Michigan and Vermont residents </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-access-ballot-november-these-states" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will vote on abortion ballot questions</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on election day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A September </span><a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_Politics_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202209021321.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist National, a survey research center, found </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inflation was the number one voting issue for Americans, with 30% saying it was “top of mind” when they thought about how they’d vote in November&#8217;s election. That figure was down from 37% in a July poll. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion came in second, with 22% of people surveyed citing it as a top issue, up from 18% in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision on Dobbs this summer has had a major impact on electoral politics heading toward the midterm elections,&#8221; Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said in a statement accompanying the poll. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion has likely been the most significant factor in improving Democrats’ chances in the past few months, Erin Covey, an analyst with the forecasting group Inside Elections, said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the inflation issue is also powerful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consumer price index, which is the average market basket of consumer goods and services bought by a household, has </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a continued increase in the cost of shelter, food, medical costs and education. The CPI determined that food has increased 11.4% over the last year — the largest 12-month increase since May 1979.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite economic concerns, the poll still found that Democrats have a 4-point advantage over Republicans in this upcoming election, primarily due to the Supreme Court’s decision.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tight races</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have seized upon abortion as an issue to motivate their base and get new voters to the polls, but it’s unclear if those new voter registrants, particularly women, are due to the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling and if that will help Democrats win tight races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In every election since 1980, women have always outnumbered men in regard to voter registrations, </span><a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data compiled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic data firm </span><a href="https://insights.targetsmart.com/the-targetsmart-voter-registration-dashboard.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TargetSmart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which tracks voter registrations, found that there was a spike in registrations of women voters following the early leak of the Dobbs decision, but voter registrations in 2018 and 2020 were still higher than voter registrations when Roe v. Wade was overturned on June 24.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite their struggles dealing with the abortion issue, Republican leaders in the U.S. House still expect they’ll regain control. But key Democrats have become more outspoken in recent weeks, saying voters will keep them in the majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer and Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal have all said they expect to hold onto the House. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelosi, a California Democrat, said this week on CBS&#8217; “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” that overturning Roe v. Wade had a significant impact on how Democrats are approaching the midterm campaigns, leading to “a whole different attitude on the part of some about whether we could win.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel just watching each of the races — forgive me for saying this, in a very cold-blooded way, as to which races we can win, to ensure that we not only hold the House, but we increase our number,” Pelosi said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jayapal, of Washington state, said on a call with reporters she plans to campaign for at-risk progressive Democrats in the coming weeks, noting that many of the CPC’s members are also in the so-called Frontline program, which directs resources to Democrats in swing districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think progressives can win in tough districts and have shown it over and over again,” Jayapal said.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats’ pitch</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates are running on what they call a raft of accomplishments over the last two years of unified government, touting infrastructure, climate change and prescription drug prices, among others, Tommy Garcia, a spokesman for House Democrats’ campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said. They are also focused on what they call Republican candidates’ extremism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Democratic majority will build on this historic progress, continue fighting to lower the cost of living for working families, and restore </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s abortion protections that Republican judges ripped away,” Garcia said in a written statement. “Voters will reject the GOP’s plan to ban abortion nationwide, throw out votes if they don&#8217;t like the results of an election, gut Social Security and Medicare, and stir up fear for their own benefit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden’s approval rating has ticked up since Democrats notched a few victories this summer, passing bills on gun violence and climate, health and taxes, as well as granting student loan debt relief. Moderate drops in gas prices from record highs earlier this year have also helped, Covey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, polling in individual races has not shown a massive shift toward Democratic candidates, she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Biden’s approval has gone up a bit, the generic ballot a little bit better. And obviously, we have seen Democratic over-performance in special elections,” she said. “In terms of the polling on an individual level, there hasn&#8217;t been a significant shift towards that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts still rate a Republican takeover of the House as the most likely outcome, though the prospect of a landslide election is less probable, she added.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who’s at risk?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has 39 members in its Frontline program, naming them as at risk of losing reelection. The House’s current party breakdown is 220 Democrats, 212 Republicans and three vacancies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP’s campaign arm, placed 75 Democrats on its “</span><a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2022/06/09/nrcc-expands-target-list-to-75-following-conclusion-of-redistricting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">target list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” after all states completed their redistricting processes in June. The cohort includes all of the Frontline Democrats, except Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Pat Ryan of New York. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, however, has 30 House races </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the “toss-up” category,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with 20 of those held by Democrats, nine controlled by GOP members and one new district in Colorado.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cook places 194 House seats as leaning toward Democratic control while 211 seats are favored for Republicans. That means the GOP needs to win fewer of the 30 toss-up races to reach the 218 seats needed to control the chamber. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While every House seat is up for reelection for another two-year term, just one-third of the Senate will face voters on Nov. 8, since members are elected to six-year terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate races, Cook </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin races as toss-ups. The Arizona, Colorado and New Hampshire races lean toward a Democrat winning. And the Florida, North Carolina and Ohio races lean toward a Republican victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine Senate seats held by Democrats are expected to stay blue, while 15 seats up this cycle that are held by Republicans are in the solidly GOP category. The Utah Senate race is classified as likely going to a Republican, according to Cook’s ratings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennsylvania, where Democrat John Fetterman faces Republican Mehmet Oz for an open seat, was rated as </span>lean Democrat, but was moved to a toss-up this week, with Cook’s Senate and Governors Editor Jessica Taylor writing that it has become a “margin-of-error” race.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Republicans and Democrats alike admit the race has tightened and that Pennsylvania could be the tipping point state for the Senate majority,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden ratings</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip Chen, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Denver, said that in the Senate, Democrats have a better chance of picking up more seats because “Republicans are defending a lot of seats, and Democrats are fairly solid in the ones that they&#8217;re holding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the popularity of the president does come into play. A </span><a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this month found that Biden’s approval was only 40%, which was actually up from his May low of 36% approval in the same survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really will have to see how much the national mood dissatisfaction with President Biden and (how) things like that really do influence things, (and) how much of it is just the Senate is a tougher battle for Republicans this time around,” Chen said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Republican Senatorial Committee has </span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cmte=NRSC&amp;cycle=2022" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> millions of dollars against Democrats in key states. This election cycle the NRSC has spent more than $9 million against Sen. Mark Kelly in Arizona, and more than $4 million against Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has </span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cycle=2022&amp;cmte=DSCC" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $10.5 million against Kelly’s Republican opponent, Blake Masters, and $3 million against Warnock’s Republican opponent, Herschel Walker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden, speaking at a Democratic National Committee reception in New Jersey on Thursday, cited the tendency for the president’s party to lose some power in the first midterms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based on statistics, the Democrats are running uphill because of the fact that, with only a couple exceptions, the first term of an incumbent president on the off-year election has been not a good deal most times,” Biden said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then predicted that Democrats would hold the Senate, possibly picking up “a couple seats,” though he didn’t seem as optimistic about the party’s chances of keeping the House — blaming trends at the state level. Biden pointed out there’s been “​​a lot of gerrymandering in the House across the country, because a lot of governors aren&#8217;t Democratic governors.”</span></p>

(Scott Elmquist/Style Weekly)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Thursday announced executive actions that would <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/06/granting-pardon-for-the-offense-of-simple-possession-of-marijuana/" target="_blank">pardon thousands of people </a>with prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession.</p>
<p>Biden then called on governors to follow suit with state offenses for simple marijuana possession, saying that “just as no one should be in a federal prison solely due to the possession of marijuana, no one should be in a local jail or state prison for that reason, either.”</p>
<p>The president also directed U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra and Attorney General Merrick Garland to review how marijuana is classified under federal law as a Schedule I drug, the Drug Enforcement Agency’s most dangerous classification that includes substances like heroin and LSD.</p>
<p>Biden’s executive order to pardon simple possession includes the District of Columbia as well as people convicted in the federal court system.</p>
<p>“Sending people to prison for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit,” Biden said in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/06/statement-from-president-biden-on-marijuana-reform/" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Failed approach to marijuana’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The move is intended to address <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/12/22/federal-law-still-treats-marijuana-as-an-illegal-drug-creating-headaches-for-states/" target="_blank">the country’s “failed approach to marijuana,”</a> a senior administration official said Thursday afternoon minutes before the announcement.</p>
<p>Recreational use of marijuana is legal in 19 states, including Virginia, but there is still a mix of laws related to the drug. In 38 states, marijuana is allowed for medical purposes. Several others consider marijuana illegal in all forms.</p>
<p>Civil rights organizations and researchers have shown that charges for marijuana possession disproportionately affect Black and brown communities. For example, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/sentencing-reform/war-marijuana-black-and-white" target="_blank">ACLU found</a> that Black people were 3.7 times more likely to be charged with marijuana possession compared to white people.</p>
<p>Police made 663,000 arrests for <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/22/four-in-ten-u-s-drug-arrests-in-2018-were-for-marijuana-offenses-mostly-possession/" target="_blank">marijuana-related offenses</a> in 2018, according to FBI data, which amounted to 40% of all drug arrests for that year.</p>
<p>A senior administration official said Thursday that “while white, Black and brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black and brown people are disproportionately in jail for it.”</p>
<p>Senior administration officials said that even if a person has not been charged with or convicted of marijuana possession, as of Thursday’s date, “the pardon does cover that conduct.”</p>
<p>The Department of Justice will create an administrative process for those who are pardoned to obtain a certificate of their pardon “so that they will have documentation that they can show to law enforcement, employers and others as needed,” a senior administration official said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States moved first</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>States began decriminalizing or legalizing recreational use of marijuana in 2012, when Colorado and Washington voters passed statewide ballot measures. Over the next decade, 17 more states followed suit. Those states have operated for years in conflict with federal laws that have kept the substance strictly illegal.</p>
<p>Virginia <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/07/marijuana-will-be-legal-in-virginia-on-july-1-heres-what-is-and-isnt-permitted-under-the-new-law/" target="_blank">became the first state in the South to legalize marijuana in 2021</a>, although state lawmakers have <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/28/house-gop-kills-bill-to-begin-retail-recreational-marijuana-sales-this-year/" target="_blank">struggled to agree on the parameters of a retail market</a>.</p>

<p>The U.S. House <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/04/01/u-s-house-votes-to-decriminalize-marijuana-in-federal-law/" target="_blank">passed legislation</a> earlier this year to legalize marijuana nationally, but the bill failed to gain traction in the Senate.</p>
<p>The House <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022107" target="_blank">voted 220-204</a> to approve <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617" target="_blank">the measure</a>, which would fix the split between federal law and law in states where recreational marijuana is legal. Three Republicans joined all but two Democrats in approving the measure.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers reacted positively to Biden’s announcement, and several called for full legalization.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said federal drug policies relating to marijuana have harmed communities of color and torn families apart.</p>
<p>“These transformative actions are the latest manifestation of Democrats’ unyielding commitment to justice, especially for those unfairly harmed by cannabis criminalization,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>“A great first step for equitable treatment under the law — but we can and we will do more when we (expand) our Democratic majorities in November,” Virginia’s Rep. Gerry Connolly <a href="https://twitter.com/ElectConnolly/status/1578110544241983494" target="_blank">said</a>. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine called the move &#8220;wise and compassionate.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. Sen Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, applauded the move in a statement and called for passage of<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4591" target="_blank"> a bill</a> he sponsored, along with New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, that would remove the substance from the list of controlled substances and expunge the records of anyone convicted of a marijuana-related crime.</p>
<p>“Legal protections for victims of the War on Drugs should be codified in law, cannabis should be descheduled and a federal regulatory system should be put in place to protect public health and safety,” he said.</p>
<p>Schumer called the action “historic” and said he hoped it would catalyze further congressional action.</p>
<p>“For far too long, the federal prohibition on cannabis and the War on Drugs has been a war on people, and particularly people of color,” the New York Democrat said in a statement. “President Biden’s action to pardon people convicted of simple marijuana possession under federal law is a huge step forward to correct decades of over-criminalization.”</p>
<p>Chair of the House Education and Labor Committee Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat, said in a statement that incarcerating people for possession of marijuana does not keep communities safer and is a waste of federal resources.</p>
<p>“We should instead be using those funds on evidence-based prevention and early intervention initiatives that actually reduce crime and save money,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP ties pardons to crime</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Many more Democrats than Republicans commented on the move, which is in line with most Americans’ views on marijuana. A MorningConsult/Politico <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/05/most-voters-back-federal-marijuana-legalization/" target="_blank">poll this month</a> found that 60% of respondents favored legalization.</p>
<p>Republicans who did comment largely framed the initiative as soft on crime. Republicans are making rising crime rates a campaign issue in next month’s elections.</p>
<p>“In the midst of a crime wave and on the brink of a recession, Joe Biden is giving blanket pardons to drug offenders — many of whom pled down from more serious charges,” Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican of Arkansas, said on Twitter. An earlier version of the tweet, which was deleted after nine minutes, complained of pardons to “pot heads.”</p>
<p>Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is retiring this year, said in a statement that the Justice Department should not issue “blanket pardons” and each offender should be looked at individually. Hutchinson was the director of the Drug Enforcement Administration under President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>“As governor I have issued hundreds of pardons to those who have been convicted of drug offenses,” he said. “But in this time of rising crime there should be a clear record of law-abiding conduct before pardons are issued.”</p>
<p>Hutchinson is staunchly anti-legalization and has publicly opposed the proposed constitutional amendment on the Nov. 8 ballot that would create a legal marijuana regime in Arkansas.</p>
<p>Candidates campaigning for Congress quickly weighed in on the announcement as well, with Pennsylvania Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman saying in a statement that it’s “a massive step towards justice.”</p>
<p>“Too many lives — and lives of Black and brown Americans in particular — have been derailed by this criminalization of this plant,” Fetterman said.</p>
<p>Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who is running for the open Senate seat, tweeted “legalize it” from his congressional Twitter account.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Schedule 1 drug</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Unless Congress changes federal marijuana laws or the president takes further action, marijuana is likely to stay classified as a Schedule 1 drug for the near future.</p>
<p>Senior administration officials said Thursday it will take a while for the HHS secretary and the attorney general to assess if marijuana should stay in the highest classification or drop to a lower category within the DEA’s system.</p>
<p>“The process will take some time, because it must be based on a careful consideration of all of the available evidence, including scientific … and medical information that&#8217;s available,” the senior administration official said, adding that while Biden hasn’t set a timeline he wants the review to be “expeditious.”</p>
<p>The DEA has five schedule classifications for legal and illegal drugs, with Schedule 1 including substances with a high potential for abuse and no medical use. Heroin, LSD and peyote are classified as Schedule 1 drugs along with marijuana.</p>
<p>The next category, Schedule 2, is supposed to host drugs with a high potential for abuse and that can lead to “severe psychological or physical dependence,” according to the DEA. Cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamine and oxycodone are all currently classified as Schedule 2.</p>
<p>Schedule 3 includes substances with a low to moderate likelihood of physical and psychological dependence, such as anabolic steroids and testosterone. Schedule 4 hosts drugs like Xanax, Valium and Ambien that have a low potential for abuse, according to the DEA. And Schedule 5 includes substances with a lower possibility of abuse than Schedule 4.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court opened its term Monday with an Idaho case that could significantly restrict the federal government’s power to enforce clean water laws and prove crucial in determining wetland protections.</p>
<p>The oral arguments came just months after the court’s 6-3 conservative majority limited executive authority to address climate change in a case involving federal regulation of greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pacificlegal.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/2022.04.11-Sackett-v.-EPA-PLF-Opening-Brief-on-the-Merits.pdf" target="_blank">clean water case</a>, brought by an Idaho couple seeking to build a house on a plot of land they bought near Priest Lake in the state’s panhandle, provides an opportunity for the court to rein in what types of waters are subject to a provision of the Clean Water Act known as “Waters of the United States.”</p>
<p>The property of Michael and Chantell Sackett is across a road from wetlands that eventually drain into Priest Lake. The Environmental Protection Agency has required the couple to obtain federal permits before they build, but the couple has argued that because their property doesn’t contain any waters itself, it shouldn’t be subject to Clean Water Act requirements.</p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that the case was about much more than one couple’s building permits.</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s put aside the facts of this case, because this case is going to be important for wetlands throughout the country,” he told the Sacketts’ attorney, Damien Schiff of the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation.</p>
<p>The law doesn’t define what is considered a water of the United States subject to federal regulation, and land that is situated near and drains into a covered waterway can also be subject to regulation, which is what the EPA has argued in the Sacketts’ case.</p>
<p>The case is about how broad that definition can be. Monday’s arguments indicated the status quo may be too broad for the court’s conservative majority to accept.</p>
<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch pushed U.S. Justice Department attorney Brian Fletcher to define the distance from a waterway that land would be subject to regulation. Fletcher could not offer a distinct answer, prompting Gorsuch to wonder how property owners or potential property owners could be expected to determine what their responsibilities are under the law.</p>
<p>“If the federal government doesn&#8217;t know, how is the person subject to criminal time in federal prison supposed to know?” he said.</p>
<p>Taking part in her first oral argument as a member of the court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked what the process was for determining if a particular property was covered.</p>
<p>Property owners can receive, at no cost to them, an analysis from federal agencies about whether they need to seek permits, Fletcher said.</p>
<p>Further, property rights are not restricted by federal permitting requirements, he said.</p>
<p>“The fact that they’re covered by the act does not mean that development is prohibited, it just means that development has to be permitted,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Meaning of ‘adjacent’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Another piece of the Sacketts’ argument was that their land was not in fact adjacent to a covered water because a road separated their property from the water.</p>
<p>Several justices, both liberal and conservative, appeared skeptical of that argument.</p>
<p>Jackson responded to Schiff’s argument that Congress differentiated between land abutting covered waters and land nearby by noting that the Clean Water Act’s purpose was to preserve water quality.</p>
<p>“Why would Congress draw the coverage line between abutting wetlands and neighboring wetlands when the objective of the statute is to ensure the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the nation&#8217;s water?” she said. “Are you saying that neighboring wetlands can&#8217;t impact the quality of navigable waters?”</p>
<p>The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have long accepted that nearby land can affect waters that are covered by the Clean Water Act. That’s still true if there’s a human-made construction like a berm or a road, Fletcher said.</p>
<p>“For 45 years, the EPA and the Army Corps has recognized that the presence of such a barrier does not categorically strip a wetland of the act’s protections,” he said.</p>
<p>Even some of the court’s conservative justices seemed skeptical of the Sacketts’ argument that their land was not adjacent to covered water.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts made an analogy with a train station and train tracks. A station does not physically touch the tracks, but is considered to be adjacent to them.</p>
<p>Executive agencies, under presidents of both parties, have long held that neighboring — not only abutting — lands were covered, Kavanaugh told Schiff.</p>
<p>“Why did seven straight administrations not agree with you?” he asked.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Significant nexus</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>But even if a majority of justices are unpersuaded by the Sacketts’ adjacency argument, the conservatives might not miss an opportunity to narrow the regulatory authority of the Clean Water Act.</p>
<p>“The composition of this court is likely to go in a narrower way,” Melissa Reynolds, an attorney with Holland &amp; Hart’s water law office, said in a Monday interview. “It&#8217;s not expanding jurisdiction and hindering private property owners moving forward — it’s kind of the opposite direction.”</p>
<p>In June, in one of the final decisions of its previous term, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-curbs-federal-power-regulate-greenhouse-gases-blow-biden" target="_blank">the court held</a> that the EPA could not use the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions on an industry-wide scale, dealing a blow to federal efforts to address climate change.</p>
<p>Under the past three presidential administrations, the working definitions of waters of the United States have shifted.</p>
<p>But in general, the federal government has been working under a “significant nexus” standard holding that anything with a meaningful intersection with covered waters is subject to Clean Water Act regulation.</p>
<p>The court’s conservatives, though, indicated they may like to narrow that standard.</p>
<p>“I imagine that most of the water flow and rainfall and snowfall in quite a large geographic area drains into the lake eventually,” Gorsuch said. “How does any reasonable person know — within maybe 100 square miles in a watershed that drains into a body of water that is a water of the United States — whether their land is adjacent?”</p>
<p>The Biden administration is working on a new rule to further define waters of the United States. That rule is being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, Fletcher said. That step is usually one of the last before a rule becomes final.</p>
<p>A final rule is likely before the end of the year, Fletcher said, which would likely be before a decision from the court.</p>

<p>Congressional Democrats are deeply divided over the Manchin permitting <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/EAB527DC-FA23-4BA9-B3C6-6AB108626F02?utm_source=DCS+Congressional+E-mail&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.energy.senate.gov%2fservices%2ffiles%2fEAB527DC-FA23-4BA9-B3C6-6AB108626F02&amp;utm_campaign=MANCHIN+RELEASES+COMPREHENSIVE+PERMITTING+REFORM+TEXT+TO+BE+INCLUDED+IN+CONTINUING+RESOLUTION" target="_blank">bill</a>, with some on the left worried it would remove tools for communities to oppose projects with major environmental impacts. The chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, Rep. Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, blasted the Manchin plan on Wednesday night and said, “My colleagues and I don’t want this.”</p>
<p>A provision in the legislation to approve the Mountain Valley Pipeline in Virginia and Manchin’s home state of West Virginia also alienated Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who said he was not consulted and raised strong objections.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot support the Mountain Valley Pipeline-related provisions in this legislative text,&#8221; he said in a statement. &#8220;Over 100 miles of this pipeline are in Virginia, but I was not included in the discussions regarding the MVP provisions and therefore not given an opportunity to share Virginians&#8217; concerns. In that sense, I stand in the same position as many of my constituents who have felt ignored along the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley is leading a letter from Senate progressives urging separate votes on a must-pass stopgap spending measure and the permitting legislation, according to a Politico report.</p>
<p>Adding to problems, the top Senate Republican on the chamber’s spending committee told States Newsroom Wednesday afternoon that the inclusion of the permitting measure and other provisions may make the stopgap bill unworkable.</p>
<p>But Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer has continued to say the Manchin plan will be included in the stopgap spending bill to keep the government open when the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Details on Manchin plan</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Manchin <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/92E7EAA5-E7BC-48E1-8E7F-FE688AE43252?utm_source=DCS+Congressional+E-mail&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;utm_term=https%3a%2f%2fwww.energy.senate.gov%2fservices%2ffiles%2f92E7EAA5-E7BC-48E1-8E7F-FE688AE43252&amp;utm_campaign=MANCHIN+RELEASES+COMPREHENSIVE+PERMITTING+REFORM+TEXT+TO+BE+INCLUDED+IN+CONTINUING+RESOLUTION" target="_blank">bill</a> would not remove any federal permitting requirements.</p>
<p>Instead, it would prescribe timelines for federal agencies to complete their reviews, including a two-year target for National Environmental Policy Act reviews on major projects. Such reviews can take up to 10 years, Manchin has said.</p>
<p>The bill includes a section requiring federal agencies to approve the 303-mile Mountain Valley Pipeline, which has been partially constructed to send natural gas from West Virginia to southern Virginia, upsetting Kaine.</p>

<p>The bill would also set a five-month limit on court challenges and require federal agencies to act within six months when a court remands a decision to them.</p>
<p>Manchin’s proposal would also designate a lead federal agency to coordinate project reviews. The lead agency would monitor requirements and deadlines set at the state level.</p>
<p>Manchin and other supporters of the measure have said it&#8217;s needed to deliver energy from renewable sources like wind and solar.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to build a wind farm or a solar farm in the middle of the desert where there’s no people … you’ve got to have permitting reform to get it done,” Manchin said Tuesday. “You’re not going to be able to deliver the energy that people need.”</p>
<p>American Clean Power Association Heather Zichal said that &#8220;as renewable energy projects become more prevalent &#8230; we must consider reasonable permitting reforms that preserve the substance of bedrock environmental laws while expediting the review process under them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But other environmental groups have already come out in opposition to the measure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Building a clean energy future that benefits all Americans cannot start by silencing frontline communities and eroding the laws that protect our access to clean air and water,&#8221; said Southern Environmental Law Center Director of Federal Affairs Nat Mund in a statement. &#8220;It&#8217;s absurd to suggest this deal, early versions of which were literally covered with fossil fuel lobbyists&#8217; digital fingerprints, will do anything but exacerbate climate change at the expense of communities that depend on clean air and water that this proposal threatens.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Progressive opposition </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Members of Senate Democrats’ progressive wing have for weeks criticized potential permitting reforms, which they say would remove power from local communities seeking to challenge pipelines and other projects.</p>
<p>Merkley, the chairman of the Senate appropriations panel on Interior and environmental agencies, and Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, all reportedly signed on to the letter calling for separate votes on the permitting bill and the stopgap bill — which would allow senators to stake out a clear position on the Manchin plan.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Merkley confirmed the Politico report but declined to comment further or provide a copy of the letter Wednesday.</p>
<p>“We are making clear we would like a separate vote — a separate debate and a separate vote — on the permitting process,” Warren told reporters Wednesday.</p>
<p>More than 70 House Democrats <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/third-us-house-democrats-oppose-manchin-permitting-deal-stopgap-spending-bill" target="_blank">sent a similar letter</a> to leaders of their caucus earlier this month.</p>
<p>Grijalva, who spearheaded House Democrats’ letter, issued a strong statement in opposition to the Manchin proposal.</p>
<p>The measure shortens public comment periods, provides fewer ways for communities to oppose projects and weakens enforcement of foundational environmental and public health laws, the Arizona Democrat said.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="evbf4069gY"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/02/03/federal-court-again-overturns-another-mountain-valley-pipeline-permit/">Federal court (again) overturns (another) Mountain Valley Pipeline permit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Federal court (again) overturns (another) Mountain Valley Pipeline permit&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/02/03/federal-court-again-overturns-another-mountain-valley-pipeline-permit/embed/#?secret=jWH7CYRGmN#?secret=evbf4069gY" data-secret="evbf4069gY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>“These dangerous permitting shortcuts have been on industry wish lists for years,” he said. “And now they’ve added the Mountain Valley Pipeline approval as the rotten cherry on top of the pile. The very fact that this fossil fuel brainchild is being force-fed into must-pass government funding speaks to its unpopularity.”</p>
<p>Kaine, who recently <a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/warner-and-kaine-reintroduce-bill-to-make-ferc-pipeline-permitting-process-more-transparent-and-fair" target="_blank">reintroduced separate legislation</a> with Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner to increase public input and notification requirements for pipelines as well as clarify the circumstances under which eminent domain can be exercised, said he agreed “with the need to reform our broken process for permitting infrastructure” but disagreed with the congressional approval of the pipeline.</p>
<p>“Green-lighting the MVP is contrary to the spirit of permitting reform,” he said. “Such a deliberate action by Congress to put its thumb on the scale and simply approve this project while shutting down opportunities for full administrative or judicial review is at odds with the bipartisan desire to have a more transparent and workable permitting process.”</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2022/9/manchin-releases-comprehensive-permitting-reform-text-to-be-included-in-continuing-resolution" target="_blank">a statement</a> accompanying the bill announcement, Manchin repeated that Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the White House had all agreed to pass the legislation, which was part of a deal this summer to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-signs-law-democrats-wide-ranging-climate-change-health-care-and-tax-bill" target="_blank">pass the Inflation Reduction Act</a>.</p>
<p>The Democrats opposed to the bill have not threatened to vote against the combined measure and risk a government shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Spending bill pitfalls</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With annual government funding set to expire at the end of the month, Congress is expected to consider very soon a short-term bill to keep the government open for the coming months.</p>
<p>Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he and fellow GOP lawmakers may filibuster the short-term government funding bill — which would need Republican support to pass — if Democrats add too many additional provisions.</p>
<p>That means they would not supply the 10 Republican votes needed for any legislation to advance in the evenly divided Senate.</p>
<p>&#8220;What could be telling would be when Schumer puts the legislation on the floor and there&#8217;s a motion to proceed, subject to debate, subject to 60 votes — that vote will be indicative of maybe things to come if he&#8217;s loaded it up with extraneous things,&#8221; Shelby said. &#8220;It probably won&#8217;t carry that well.”</p>
<p>When asked about Manchin&#8217;s permitting reform bill, which at that point had not been made public, and Schumer&#8217;s commitment to add it to the must-pass government funding bill, Shelby said, &#8220;I think it&#8217;s going to be hard to carry that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen the language of it,” he said. “But it&#8217;s a raw political deal.&#8221;</p>

(Photo by MPI/Getty Images)</p><p>The U.S. House is considering a bill that would put lynching sites in western Tennessee on track to become part of the National Park Service, part of a trend this year of Congress using the agency to advance discussions of the nation’s troubled and often violent racial history.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7912/text?r=1&amp;s=1" target="_blank">bill</a> from U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat, would require the National Park Service to study the feasibility of adding sites in and around Memphis where white mobs committed lynchings for decades, from just after the Civil War to the Jim Crow era.</p>
<p>Proponents of the bill say understanding an ugly past in which Black people were terrorized and murdered is important.</p>
<p>“Until we remind people of our past, we will not over overcome it, and we will not have a better society,” Cohen said during a July subcommittee hearing on the bill. “We need to recognize the errors in our past.”</p>
<p>Some 119 lynchings have been recorded in all regions of Virginia between 1866 and 1934, according to data collected through James Madison University&#8217;s <a href="https://sites.lib.jmu.edu/valynchings/data-visualization/" target="_blank">&#8220;Racial Terror: Lynchings in Virginia&#8221; project.</a>  Most of the lynchings were of Black men, although 22 were of White people.</p>
<p>In 2019, the Virginia House of Delegates and Senate <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-expresses-profound-regret-for-history-of-lynchings/" target="_blank">passed a resolution &#8220;acknowledg[ing] with profound regret</a> the existence and acceptance of lynching within the Commonwealth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The legacy of racism that outlived slavery, enabled the rise and acceptance of lynching, facilitated segregation and disenfranchisement, and denied education and civil rights to African Americans has yet to be uprooted in Virginia, the South, and the nation, and this dark and shameful chapter of American history must be understood, acknowledged, and fully documented and the seemingly irreparable breach mended,&#8221; <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+ful+HJ655ER" target="_blank">the resolution</a> read in part.</p>
<p>Preserving pieces of history has taken on added importance amid a heated national debate about how the nation’s history of centuries of slavery and oppression of Black people should be taught, Tiffany Patterson, the chair of Vanderbilt University’s African American and diaspora studies program, said in an interview.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s a backlash coming from the political arena and spilling over into parents and teachers and politicians and so on that are terrified of that being really discussed,” she said. “So I think, acknowledging places and making it a kind of museum for teaching purposes for the general public is what&#8217;s needed.”</p>
<p>Rich Watkins, the chairman of the board of the Lynching Sites Project of Memphis, a nonprofit seeking to commemorate about two dozen sites of lynchings in the area, said part of his group’s goal was to establish a shared set of facts that could then lead to meaningful reflection.</p>
<p>“We are, unfortunately, in an era where people disagree about the facts,” Watkins said in an interview.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Thousands of lynchings</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The history of lynchings — racist extrajudicial killings — is often not taught in schools, Watkins said. While most lynching victims were Black, mobs also attacked non-Black people who may have helped Black people, according to the NAACP civil rights organization.</p>
<p>Nearly 5,000 people were lynched in the United States from 1882 to 1968, <a href="https://naacp.org/find-resources/history-explained/history-lynching-america" target="_blank">according to records</a> maintained by the NAACP. The Memphis project lists 24 sites where 36 people were killed.</p>
<p>One site commemorates the 1917 lynching of Ell Persons, a Black man beaten into confessing to killing a white girl. A mob took Persons from his jail cell, “then burned, decapitated and dismembered him in front of an estimated crowd of 3,000 people who congregated on Macon Road near the Wolf River in Memphis,” according to a press release from Cohen’s office.</p>
<p>Federal recognition through a National Park Service designation would add legitimacy to the effort to grapple with the history of lynching in the United States, which is addressed at some memorials and sites in the U.S. but not directly within the park system.</p>
<p>“It tells a visitor that this is something that this country is recognizing that happened and we&#8217;re accepting these facts,” said Watkins. “And it left a mark on our society writ large and writ small as well.”</p>
<p>“For the government to confront it is one of the ways that we eventually change attitudes,” said Patterson.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Is it just symbolic?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>National Park Service recognition may seem purely symbolic, but that doesn’t make it unimportant, said Robert Bland, an assistant professor of history and Africana studies at the University of Tennessee who specializes in the study of race and memory in the United States.</p>
<p>“I think there’s kind of an instinct to say, ‘It’s just symbolic and what about real policy measures?’” he said.</p>
<p>But especially as elements of the political right have mobilized to stifle history that makes some people uncomfortable, symbolic efforts are still important, he said.</p>
<p>“History’s always had propagandistic and kind of myth-making purposes,” he said. “Our history’s often been used to defend, in many cases, white supremacy.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other bills</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There is no committee markup — the next step toward enactment — of the Cohen bill scheduled. And Watkins conceded it might be a “multi-year” effort.</p>
<p>But Congress enacted bills with similar missions earlier this year, voting to add a former <a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/02/16/internment-camp-amache-national-park-system/" target="_blank">Japanese internment camp in southeastern Colorado as part</a> of the National Park System and <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/04/26/congress-expands-brown-v-board-of-education-historic-site-beyond-kansas/" target="_blank">to expand sites related to the Brown v. Board of Education</a> Supreme Court case in Kansas that ended legal school segregation. Under the latter, the Robert Russa Moton High School site in Farmville, Virginia, already a national historic landmark and museum, became an affiliate of the National Park Service.</p>
<p>At the same July hearing where the House Natural Resources National Parks Forests and Public Lands Subcommittee considered the lynching sites bill, members also heard about bills to honor Mexican-American farmworker organizer Cesar Chavez with sites in Arizona and California and John P. Parker, an Ohio conductor on the Underground Railroad who helped slaves escape Kentucky.</p>
<p>Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva, a Democrat of Arizona, cheered the panel for considering those bills and their focus on history, especially of underrepresented groups.</p>

<p>“There’s been a real effort on the part of this committee—and they should be applauded for that—for beginning to tell the full story of the American experience and American history through our parks, our public lands and our public assets,” Grijalva said at the July subcommittee hearing on the lynching sites bill and others. “That’s a good thing.”</p>
<p>Kym A. Hall, the director of the National Park Service’s capital region, said the agency sought to better reflect the nation’s diversity.</p>
<p>“The goals of this current administration, and certainly of the National Park Service and the secretary of the Interior, are to tell broader stories across the United States, things that may not have been brought forward in our country&#8217;s history in a more meaningful way so that a variety of people can connect to those stories,” Hall said at the hearing.</p>
<p>“We have spent the last 10, 20, 30 years of our 100-year organization recognizing that there are many more stories to be told,” she added.</p>
<p>Watkins, the leader of the Memphis project, said NPS involvement was an important piece of national reconciliation.</p>
<p>“With the National Park Service sites, it elevates the stature of those sites,” Watkins said. “This site is recognized as being important on a federal and national level — not just in that neighborhood or that city. It means that we as a nation are starting to come to terms with these wrongs.”</p>

(Ned Oliver / Virginia Mercury)</p><p>More than 50 U.S. House members are objecting to a push to revise federal environmental permitting requirements for energy projects — part of a deal Democratic leaders struck with U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin III to win passage of their climate, health and taxes bill that passed last month.</p>
<p>The House members signed onto a letter led by House Natural Resources Chairman Raul Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat aligned with the party’s progressive wing. The letter urges House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland to omit permitting legislation from a must-pass spending bill this month.</p>
<p>Congressional leaders have not released text of a permitting bill, but a one-page summary last month indicated it would set time limits on agency reviews and environmental litigation challenging energy projects, designate high-priority projects for fast-track reviews and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/02/federal-climate-deal-could-force-completion-of-mountain-valley-pipeline/" target="_blank">require completion</a> of the Mountain Valley Pipeline in West Virginia and Virginia.</p>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in the run-up to a vote on Democrats’ <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-signs-law-democrats-wide-ranging-climate-change-health-care-and-tax-bill" target="_blank">$750 billion budget bill</a> that he had pledged to Manchin, a moderate Democrat from coal-rich West Virginia, that the Senate would take up a separate bill reforming environmental permitting.</p>
<p>Schumer said he didn’t generally like limiting environmental reviews, but that the deal was worth it to ensure passage of the Democrats’ bill that would spend <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/climate-spending-new-reconciliation-deal-turning-point-us-supporters-say-0" target="_blank">$370 billion on clean energy programs</a>, marking the greatest federal investment to date in addressing climate change.</p>
<p>Renewable energy projects could also benefit from a more streamlined review process, Schumer said last month.</p>
<p>But the Grijalva letter says the permitting legislation would weaken the tools used to ensure energy projects comply with environmental regulations and would specifically hurt communities near proposed projects.</p>
<p>“The inclusion of these provisions in a continuing resolution, or any other must-pass legislation, would silence the voices of frontline and environmental justice communities by insulating them from scrutiny,” the letter reads. “Such a move would force members to choose between protecting (environmental justice) communities from further pollution or funding the government.”</p>
<p>Communities of color and low-income communities are often the most negatively affected by pollution and climate change.</p>
<p>A movement known as environmental justice seeks to protect those communities from further environmental harm, and President Joe Biden’s administration has committed to including such communities in environmental decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">End of fiscal year</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Congress this month will almost certainly pass a continuing resolution to keep the federal government open after the fiscal year ends Sept. 30. The alternative would be a government shutdown.</p>
<p>The spending measure is expected to be among the last pieces of legislation Congress will pass before November’s midterm elections, and members often try to attach other priorities to this type of must-pass bill.</p>
<p>Many Republicans and others who favor more robust energy production have often complained that the federal permitting process, including requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, is too burdensome for builders and costs too much time and money.</p>
<p>The Grijalva letter advocates for additional funding for federal agencies to hasten the review process but says that NEPA and other federal reviews are too important to sacrifice.</p>
<p>“The permitting and public notice and comment provisions mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) are among the only tools local communities have to force careful review of federal projects that may have serious, long-term, environmental, and public health consequences in those communities,” the letter says.</p>
<p>Grijalva is still gathering signatures from members and expects to send the letter by the end of the week, House Natural Resources Committee spokeswoman Lindsay Gressard said. She declined to list the members who have already signed until the letter is sent, but said more than 50 had attached their names as of Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the letter, members “urge” Pelosi and Hoyer not to include permitting provisions in a continuing resolution but do not explicitly say they would vote against such a package.</p>

The Senate worked overnight Saturday into Sunday as they moved toward final passage of Senate budget reconciliation deal, which Senate Democrats have named The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The final vote was 51-50, with the tie-breaking vote being cast by Vice President Kamala Harris. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate, along party lines, passed a sweeping energy, health care, climate and tax package Sunday afternoon, following an overnight marathon of votes that resulted in just a handful of notable changes to the legislation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_of_2022.pdf" target="_blank">755-page bill</a> was passed after Vice President Kamala Harris broke a 50-50 tie in the evenly divided Senate. It now heads to the House, where Democratic leaders have announced they will take it up on Friday.</p>
<p>“At last, we have arrived,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.  Democratic senators broke out into applause as Harris announced passage of the bill, expected to total more than $700 billion.</p>
<p>Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he dedicated the measure to young Americans who have pushed and protested for the Senate to take action on climate change.</p>
<p>“This bill will kick-start the era of affordable clean energy in America,” Schumer said. “It&#8217;s a game changer.”</p>
<p>Senate passage marks a major recovery for President Joe Biden’s domestic agenda, after a larger package the White House largely wrote and pushed for the better part of a year could not win the support of centrist Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, dimming the prospects of enacting health and tax policy changes and major climate spending.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, Senate Democrats sided with American families over special interests, voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs, health insurance, and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit, while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share,” Biden said in a statement. “This bill also makes the largest investment ever in combating the existential crisis of climate change.”</p>
<p>He also urged the House to pass the bill and send it to his desk to sign into law.</p>
<p>Just two amendments during what is called vote-a-rama were added to the bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, after Democratic leaders earlier struck agreements needed to get Sinema and Manchin on board. Under budget reconciliation rules, the legislation only needed a simple majority for passage rather than the usual 60-vote threshold.</p>
<p>In the final stretch of voting and at the last minute, the Senate agreed to an amendment by John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, that made a 15% corporate tax included in the bill apply to fewer businesses owned by private equity firms.</p>
<p>The amendment was backed by Sinema, along with six other Democrats — Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Mark Kelly of Arizona.</p>
<p>The revenue lost initially was expected to be paid for by extending the cap on the state and local tax deduction. But that would have drawn opposition from lawmakers in high-tax states like New Jersey who want to get rid of the cap. Instead, Democrats found their offset in another tax provision, dealing with limits on writing off business losses.</p>
<p>In another major change Republicans successfully stripped a provision to cap insulin co-pays at $35 in private health insurance plans, citing budget rules. A similar price cap for Medicare remains in the version of the bill the Senate approved.</p>
<p>The price cap has been a priority for Warnock and likely will become a prime campaign issue for Democrats to use against Republicans who voted to remove it. Similarly, Republicans will try to use many of the amendment votes in the vote-a-rama against Democrats as the midterm campaign heats up.</p>
<p>Seven Republicans did vote with Democrats on the insulin amendment: Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi and Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.</p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Progressive changes thwarted</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p>The bill would <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2022/07/30/climate-spending-in-new-reconciliation-deal-a-turning-point-for-the-u-s-supporters-say/" target="_blank">spend nearly $370 billion on clean energy programs</a>, allow the Medicare health insurance program to negotiate some drug prices beginning in 2026, impose stiffer corporate taxes and bolster Internal Revenue Service enforcement to bring in more than $400 billion in new revenue over 10 years.</p>
<p>Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont pushed an expansion of the child tax care credit and other progressive changes to the legislation, but was defeated repeatedly as Democratic leaders argued the bill needed to remain intact in order to secure those two votes from Manchin and Sinema.</p>
<p>The amendment on the child tax care credit, which expired in December, was shot down, in a vote of 1-97.</p>
<p>Last year Democrats tried to include in an earlier version of their reconciliation bill a <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2021/12/16/bidens-big-social-spending-bill-caught-in-snags-in-the-senate/" target="_blank">10-year expansion of the program</a>, which would have <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/104743/expanding-the-child-tax-credit-could-lift-millions-of-children-out-of-poverty_0.pdf" target="_blank">lifted millions of children out of poverty</a>, but Manchin objected to it, arguing the price tag of the provision — in the Build Back Better bill — was too big.</p>
<p>Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said that Democrats will continue to work on an expansion of the child tax credit and noted the “fragile arrangement” of the bill.</p>
<p>Another unsuccessful Democratic amendment came from Warnock, who wanted a provision included in the bill to end a gap in Medicaid coverage for low-income people in his state and others, calling it a “moral moment” for senators.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rise on behalf of nearly 4.5 million Americans in 12 states, including 646,000 Georgians, who a decade after the Affordable Care Act became law, still do not have access to affordable health care. They are the working poor,” Warnock said. “They are being blocked by governors and legislatures.”</p>
<p>But Warnock’s attempt was voted down, after Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon said he “tragically” had to oppose it to preserve the substance of the bill. Four other senators voted with Warnock: Collins, Ossoff, Sanders and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy tradeoff</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Sanders also inveighed against the bill’s provisions to expand oil and gas development, despite its billions for cleaner energy sources like wind and solar, which Schumer called “the boldest climate package in U.S. history.”</p>
<p>“The bad news is this bill, as currently written, includes a huge giveaway to the fossil fuel industry,” Sanders said on the Senate floor.</p>
<p>He proposed an amendment that he said would lift out the sections of the bill related to oil and gas leasing, but it failed 1-99.</p>
<p>Sanders’ criticisms of the bill’s climate sections echoed those of the most aggressive environmental advocacy groups, who see the deal between Manchin and Schumer as not strong enough.</p>
<p>The Manchin-Schumer agreement, which formed the basis of the budget package, would require the Interior Department to make 2 million acres of federal land and 60 million acres of federal waters available for oil and gas leasing for the next decade as a condition of leasing other federal lands and waters for solar or wind development.</p>
<p>It’s a move that Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity, <a href="https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/manchin-poison-pills-buried-in-inflation-reduction-act-will-destroy-a-livable-climate-2022-07-28/" target="_blank">called</a> “a climate suicide pact.”</p>
<p>Legal and policy debates about furthering oil and gas development in the midst of global climate change have raged since Biden took office and partially stymied an ambitious agenda that began with Biden promising to ban new oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters.</p>
<p>A Louisiana federal judge in <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2021/06/16/federal-judge-halts-biden-pause-on-new-oil-and-gas-leases-across-the-u-s/" target="_blank">a June 2021 decision</a> reversed Biden’s January 2021 executive order to pause new oil and gas lease sales, saying federal law required periodic sales.</p>
<p>But in January 2022, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/28/1076281662/federal-judge-canceled-gulf-oil-and-gas-leases-climate-change" target="_blank">federal judge blocked drilling in 80 million acres</a> of waters in the Gulf of Mexico, ruling that the Biden administration did not take into consideration the effect greenhouse gas emissions from the lease would have on the planet.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senate Democrats also voted down an amendment from Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, that would have extended Title 42, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention health policy that allows border patrol officials to turn migrants away at the border during a health crisis, such as the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>If passed, his amendment would have taken $1 million out of the Affordable Care Act in order to keep Title 42 in place. In a 50-50 party-line vote, the amendment was rejected.</p>
<p>Sen. Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, also introduced an immigration-related <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00295.htm" target="_blank">amendment</a> that would have required a comprehensive plan to be put in place before Title 42 is lifted.</p>
<p>Six Democrats voted with all Republicans in favor of the amendment, which fell four votes short of the 60-vote threshold.</p>
<p>Those five vulnerable Democrats, in addition to Tester, included Cortez Masto, Hassan, Warnock, Kelly and Sinema.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, warned late Saturday that he would vote against the bill if any anti-immigration policies were included in the final package.</p>
<p>“I will not only vote no on any immigration amendment introduced, but I will vote no on the final bill if any harmful immigration amendments are adopted,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>“It has always been my north star to pass a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants that call our country home, secure our borders, and fix our broken immigration system, but the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is not the right legislative vehicle to address these deeply needed reforms to our immigration system.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes, IRS boost</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In order for Schumer to secure a vote from Sinema, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/senate-democrats-reach-deal-sinema-big-climate-health-and-tax-deal" target="_blank">he struck an agreement</a> with her to remove from the bill a provision that would have changed the way certain compensation that hedge-fund managers and private equity executives are paid, known as carried interest, is taxed.</p>
<p>Schumer said that Sinema refused to vote with Democrats, “unless we took it out.”</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan entity, found that if that provision had stayed in, it could have raised $14 billion in revenue over 10 years.</p>
<p>The Schumer-Sinema agreement would also change a separate provision setting a new 15% minimum tax rate on corporations with $1 billion or more in income.</p>
<p>The bill would give the IRS a total of $<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11977" target="_blank">79.4 billion in funding</a>. Of those funds, $46.5 billion would be given to add 87,000 new IRS jobs to help with tax enforcement and update technologies to enforce taxes on digital assets such as cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The IRS would also get $25.3 billion for operations support, and $3.2 billion would go toward taxpayer services such as education and filing services. The agency would also get $4.8 billion to update its business systems.</p>
<p>Many Republicans objected to this, including Collins, who added an amendment to prohibit the hiring of 87,000 IRS jobs unless those workers were back in the office and not working remotely.</p>
<p>“Due in large part to lax telework policies, however, the IRS has consistently failed to provide taxpayers with the service they should expect,” Collins said in a statement.  “As a result, tax refunds have been unacceptably delayed, and four out of five phone calls from taxpayers go unanswered.</p>

Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona on the Inflation Reduction Act, teeing it up for a vote in the coming days.</p><p>U.S. Senate Democrats’ wide-ranging tax, climate and health bill appears set to pass after Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona struck a deal to soften the measure’s corporate tax increase and a second tax hike aimed at wealthy finance-sector workers, Schumer told reporters Friday.</p>
<p>The revenue lost to obtain Sinema’s support would be more than made up with a new provision targeting stock buybacks, Schumer said.</p>
<p>Democrats are also likely to add up to $5 billion for the Bureau of Reclamation to address drought resiliency in the Colorado River Basin, individuals familiar with those negotiations said. The basin includes all of Arizona and parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, California, Utah and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Schumer’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/senate-democrats-reach-deal-sinema-big-climate-health-and-tax-deal" target="_blank">agreement with Sinema</a>, an influential moderate seen as the last holdout on the bill, likely put the legislation on a path to unanimity among the 50 Senate Democrats. That is a requirement for the bill to be approved under a legislative process known as reconciliation that allows Democrats to bypass the chamber’s normal 60-vote threshold.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to break a party-line tie on a vote for the bill’s final passage.</p>
<p>Concessions to Sinema included removing a provision changing the way certain compensation that hedge-fund managers and private equity executives are paid, known as carried interest, is taxed, Schumer said.</p>
<p>The New York Democrat said he strongly supported the change in taxation, but that it was a red line for Sinema.</p>
<p>“I pushed for it to be in this bill,” Schumer said. “Sen. Sinema said she would not vote for the bill — not even move to proceed — unless we took it out. So we had no choice.”</p>
<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would have raised revenue by $14 billion over 10 years.</p>
<p>The Schumer-Sinema agreement would also change a separate provision setting a new 15% minimum tax rate on corporations with $1 billion or more in income.</p>
<p>Schumer didn’t provide details of the change, saying only “a piece was taken out,” but he said it would lower the expected revenue the provision would produce from $313 billion to $258 billion.</p>
<p>The tax revenue lost in removing those two provisions would be made up with a new excise tax on stock buybacks, where public companies buy their own stock on the open market to reduce the amount publicly available and drive up the price.</p>
<p>Schumer said he “hate(s)” the buyback procedure because the money companies spend on it could otherwise be spent on creating jobs or research and development.</p>
<p>The excise tax would bring in $74 billion, he said, and should be encouraging to the caucus’ progressive wing.</p>
<p>Those changes would add up to an additional $5 billion in revenue — reportedly the exact amount Sinema is seeking in additional drought resiliency funding.</p>
<p>The exact spending figure on drought resiliency was still the subject of debate among Senate Democrats Friday afternoon but was expected to land in the billions of dollars, sources said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘It’s going to be like hell’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A handful of Senate Republicans criticized the bill from all angles during a Friday morning media availability and indicated they would make the amendment process for it as painful for Democrats as possible.</p>
<p>All GOP senators are expected to oppose the bill on the floor.</p>
<p>Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas OB-GYN before he joined the Senate, said the bill’s changes to allow Medicare to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs would hurt drug development in the pharmaceuticals industry.</p>
<p>“Why do they want to destroy the innovations that pharma has given us that saved millions of lives?” Marshall said.</p>
<p>Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana said the bill would do little to address inflation, despite Democrats’ title for the bill — the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<p>Tax breaks for electric vehicles, for example, would have little impact on Louisianans struggling to fill their gas tanks, he said.</p>
<p>“If their prescription for high fuel prices is that someone drives an electric vehicle, they have no understanding of the lives of those people whom I represent,” he said. “Folks don&#8217;t drive 15-year-old pickup trucks because they don&#8217;t want a new car. They don&#8217;t drive new cars because they can&#8217;t afford a new car. And high gas prices has made it even worse.”</p>
<p>Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the ranking Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the measure would raise the energy costs that are driving inflation.</p>
<p>Democrats have said the bill’s spending on clean energy would reduce energy bills. The measure also includes provisions to boost fossil fuel development, negotiated with Schumer by moderate West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III.</p>
<p>Republicans will propose amendments to the bill on “energy, inflation, the border and crime” to force Democrats into tough votes, said Barrasso, the No. 3 member of Republican leadership in the chamber.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Democrats “deserve” a tough series of votes because they outmaneuvered Republicans to win GOP support of a bill to boost semiconductor manufacturing while keeping the Democrats-only spending bill alive.</p>
<p>Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had indicated he would not support the semiconductor bill if Democrats still planned to pursue a reconciliation bill. But several Republicans cast yes votes on that measure last week, only to see a 725-page Schumer-Manchin bill be <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/manchin-and-us-senate-democrats-strike-deal-major-health-climate-tax-package" target="_blank">released hours later</a>.</p>
<p>“So what will vote-a-rama be like?” Graham said. “It’s going to be like hell.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Weekend session</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Schumer said the Senate would meet Saturday to begin consideration of the bill.</p>
<p>The Senate parliamentarian, an official with the duty of determining whether each section of the bill can be considered under the reconciliation process reserved for legislation with a major effect on the federal budget, was still reviewing the measure Friday.</p>
<p>Once the Senate votes to proceed to debate the bill, expected Saturday afternoon, the chamber would have 20 hours to debate it, then unlimited time to consider amendments at a rapid pace in what is called a “vote-a-rama.”</p>
<p>A final vote is expected Sunday or Monday. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland said the House will return from its recess on Aug. 12 to take up the bill.</p>

(Photo by Al Drago-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p>U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, the enigmatic Democrat from Arizona, is once again at the center of attention in Congress, where she’s the linchpin in Democrats’ plans to pass a party-line climate, health and taxes bill.</p>
<p>Democrats need every member of their Senate caucus to support the sweeping 725-page bill for it to pass in the evenly divided chamber under a complex budget process that allows certain legislation to pass by a simple majority.</p>
<p>And though Sinema is far from the only one to have withheld a statement of support, she’s seen as the person who holds the measure’s fate in her hands due to her history of bucking party leaders and her past opposition to some of its tax provisions.</p>
<p>Sinema has been crucial to either the passage or failure of major legislation this year.</p>
<p>She was at the center of negotiations in drafting the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that became law last year — and <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/07/28/bipartisan-senators-and-biden-strike-a-deal-on-550b-in-new-infrastructure-spending/" target="_blank">stood next to the president</a> at the White House when a final deal was announced. And she was one of two holdouts on a larger version of a Democrats-only spending bill.</p>
<p>But when West Virginia’s Joe Manchin III, the other Democratic senator to withhold support for an earlier package, negotiated the current package directly with Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the focus on Sinema as the only major Democratic obstacle intensified.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax provisions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Some news <a href="https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/08-3-2022/sinemas-ask/" target="_blank">reports</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/03/us/politics/sinema-climate-deal-manchin.html" target="_blank">this week</a> have indicated Sinema has a particular objection to tax provisions of the bill.</p>
<p>She reportedly is working to cut a provision that would raise the tax rate for carried interest, part of the compensation of private equity and hedge-fund managers and executives. According to <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Hedge_Fund_Manager/Salary" target="_blank">Payscale,</a> the average hedge fund manager base salary is $145,437 a year.</p>
<p>Asked about Sinema’s position on one of the tax provisions, spokeswoman Hannah Hurley sent a 2021 Arizona Republic story to explain the senator’s position on taxes more broadly.</p>
<p>“Folks have heard me say over and over again that I will only support revenue provisions that do not negatively impact Arizona’s economic growth,” she said in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/11/10/kyrsten-sinema-counters-criticism-explains-strategy-biden-bills/6368409001/?gnt-cfr=1" target="_blank">the story</a>.</p>
<p>Hurley did not respond to further questions.</p>
<p>Since her first run for the Senate in the 2018 election cycle, Sinema has raised more than $2.2 million in campaign cash from the securities and investment industry, more than from any other industry, not including retired workers, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/kyrsten-sinema/industries?cid=N00033983&amp;cycle=2022" target="_blank">according to Open Secrets</a>, a nonprofit that tracks campaign fundraising.</p>
<p>Carried interest is the percentage of an investment’s gain that money managers take as compensation. Under existing law, carried interest is taxed as an investment with a tax rate of 20% instead of an income tax rate of 37% if the money managers hold the investment for at least three years.</p>
<p>The Democratic proposal would extend that window to five years and make other changes seeking to make it harder for hedge funds and private equity firms to restructure compensation to avoid taxes. The change would bring in an additional $14 billion in federal revenue, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated.</p>
<p>Sinema is also working to change the 15% corporate minimum tax included in the legislation, according to media reports.</p>
<p>The provision would require any business with more than $1 billion in revenue to pay at least 15% in federal taxes. The CBO estimates that provision would add about $313 billion in revenue over 10 years.</p>
<p>Both measures are key to making the bill cut the deficit.</p>
<p>Even with $369 billion in energy spending, the reconciliation measure would reduce the deficit by more than $300 billion.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden in an appearance at a Democratic National Committee event on Wednesday night pleaded for the corporate tax increase, noting he’s from Delaware, the home of more corporations than any other state.</p>
<p>“I’m not anti-corporation, but everybody has to pay a little bit,” Biden said. “Fifty-five of these largest corporations in the country paid zero — zero in federal taxes while making $40 billion a year in profits.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Drought money</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Politico has also <a href="https://www.politico.com/minutes/congress/08-3-2022/sinemas-ask/" target="_blank">reported</a> Sinema is seeking a $5 billion boost to the bill’s spending on drought resiliency funding — more than eight times the funding level in the bill agreed to by Schumer and Manchin.</p>
<p>As written, the bill would provide $575 million to the Bureau of Reclamation for drought response and preparedness and $13 million for drought relief for tribes.</p>
<p>Sinema is facing a pressure campaign from business groups in Arizona that would like her to kill the tax provisions, if not the bill itself.</p>
<p>The National Association of Manufacturers and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce released <a href="https://www.nam.org/new-arizona-snap-poll-shows-manufacturing-voters-strongly-oppose-reconciliation-tax-18447/?stream=series-press-releases" target="_blank">a joint poll</a> Tuesday in which 90% of respondents opposed the bill’s 15% corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>The poll was conducted by NAM’s analytics team by text and email to Arizona manufacturing workers, managers and advocates.</p>
<p>“Arizona job creators will continue to urge lawmakers to reject this manufacturers tax and instead focus on policies that encourage job growth and strengthen our state and national economic competitiveness,” Arizona Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry President and CEO Danny Seiden said in a statement.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Climate pressure</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Environmental advocates who see the legislation as a historic step forward are attempting to sway Sinema to support the bill.</p>
<p>In red-hot Arizona, and with a potential primary challenge looming in 2024, climate may prove to be the most salient issue for her.</p>
<p>The state&#8217;s average temperature has risen 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900, according to <a href="https://statesummaries.ncics.org/chapter/az/" target="_blank">a study</a> by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Cooperative Institute for Satellite Earth System Studies.</p>
<p>The Phoenix metropolitan area saw an average of 45 days of at least 100 degrees from 2015 to 2020, also an increase from previous years.</p>
<p>And water levels at Lake Mead, which provides water to Arizona, Nevada and California, set record lows this summer.</p>
<p>Sierra Magazine, the publication of the environmental group, ran <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/paging-senator-sinema?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=sierramag&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank">an article</a> Wednesday with the title “Paging Senator Sinema: Global warming is killing your constituents — now’s the time to vote for climate action.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Her state is going to need her on this,&#8221; U.S. House Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva, a fellow Arizona Democrat closely aligned with the party’s progressive wing, <a href="https://twitter.com/marianne_levine/status/1552786469705613312" target="_blank">told reporters last week</a>. She “politically doesn’t have a choice.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">When will she decide?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Sinema’s office has said she will not decide on the bill at least until the Senate parliamentarian has ruled on whether the measure can qualify for the budget reconciliation process, a powerful tool that can be used to quickly pass legislation.</p>
<p>In order to bypass the chamber’s usual 60-vote threshold, reconciliation bills must meet a strict rule that their provisions deal with spending and revenue, with the Senate parliamentarian making the determination about what provisions meet that qualification.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, Democrats and Republicans on Senate committees were still pitching the parliamentarian on what should be allowed or disallowed in the bill.</p>
<p>Schumer said Thursday the chamber will hold a rare Saturday vote to proceed to the measure, setting up a final vote next week.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The U.S. Interior Department asked states Wednesday to apply for $725 million made available this year to clean up abandoned mine sites as part of the 2021 infrastructure bill.</p>
<p>The department officially opened a notice of funding opportunity, which gives states the avenue to request federal grants to close mine shafts, prevent the release of methane and other gases and treat acidic mine drainage.</p>
<p>Guidance <a href="https://www.osmre.gov/sites/default/files/inline-files/BIL_AML_Guidance_7-19-22.pdf" target="_blank">released last month</a> by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, an agency within Interior, also called for states to prioritize employment opportunities for coal workers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/america-is-moving-again-biden-signs-1-2t-infrastructure-bill-bringing-billions-to-pa/" target="_blank">infrastructure law</a> gave the department $11.3 billion for mine cleanup grants to be distributed over 15 years.</p>
<p>Of the $725 million in new funding next year for Abandoned Mine Lands grants, more than one-third could go to Pennsylvania, which is eligible for $244.9 million.</p>
<p>West Virginia, eligible for $140.75 million, is the only state other than Pennsylvania to be eligible for more than $100 million. Virginia can draw up to $22.8 million.</p>
<p>The Navajo Nation would also be eligible for $1.7 million from the fund.</p>
<p>The extra funding represents a huge boost for OSMRE’s abandoned mine cleanup efforts.</p>
<p>In fiscal 2022, OSMRE sent a total of $243.1 million to all states and tribes in the program, with $153.1 million funded mostly with fees paid by active coal miners and $90 million in additional federal grants. Pennsylvania had the highest allocation, with $38.1 million.</p>
<p>The extra funding in the infrastructure law was meant to both eliminate pollution from mining sites and provide job opportunities in communities that have historically relied on coal mining.</p>
<p>“Through this program, we are investing in coal communities through job creation — including for current and former coal workers — and economic revitalization, all while addressing harmful environmental impacts from these legacy developments,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.</p>
<p>In Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said that &#8220;creating jobs in coal-impacted communities is a priority and through the reclamation and repurposing of these mined lands, we hope to see additional economic activity for properties that can become suitable for development.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/july/name-937078-en.html" target="_blank">a July release from the governor&#8217;s office</a>, Virginia&#8217;s abandoned mine land program has created 792 jobs since 2017, with 100 jobs typically created every five years. The new funding is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Virginia Department of Energy Director John Warren said the funds will allow the agency to clean up over 80% of the abandoned mine land inventory the state has had since its AML program began in 1981.</p>

<p>The shift came after days of protest and vigils outside the U.S. Capitol, in heat and rain, by veterans outraged at the delay in passage of the $280 billion measure due to objections from Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey.</p>
<p>The 86-11 vote on the PACT Act, named for the late Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson of the Ohio National Guard, sends the bill to President Joe Biden for his signature. The 11 votes against the bill all came from Republicans, including Mike Crapo of Idaho, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Toomey.</p>
<p>Republican senators who switched their votes from no last week to yes Tuesday included Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Roy Blunt and Josh Hawley of Missouri, Mike Braun and Todd Young of Indiana, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy and John Kennedy of Louisiana, Steve Daines of Montana, Deb Fischer and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Rob Portman of Ohio, Rick Scott of Florida and Dan Sullivan of Alaska.</p>
<p>Biden, who has repeatedly called on Congress to address the lack of protections for veterans and their families, is expected to sign the legislation. In a statement after the vote he called it &#8220;the biggest expansion of benefits for service-connected health issues in 30 years and the largest single bill ever to comprehensively address exposure to burn pits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, urged senators to support the package ahead of the floor vote, saying the legislation had been assembled in a transparent manner without any surprises.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;d ask my fellow senators when they come to the floor and vote — think about the veterans that are standing outside the Capitol out here, think about the veterans in your home state, think about the veterans that you met while they were on active duty on your CoDels and remember them, and do the right thing,” Tester said, referring to congressional delegations that travel to war zones.</p>
<p>Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran, the ranking member on the Veterans Affairs Committee, also urged support for the measure, saying it would “provide long overdue health care and benefits to the 3.5 million post-9/11 veterans who were exposed to burn pits” as well as health care for “Vietnam veterans and those who served in Southeast Asia suffering from the exposure to Agent Orange.”</p>
<p>Moran and Tester had worked together on the legislation for years.</p>
<p>At a press conference after the vote, advocates and Senate supporters said that veterans will now get the care they need.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve ever seen a situation where people who had already given so much had to fight so hard to get so little,&#8221; said advocate and comedian Jon Stewart, who protested alongside the veterans at the Capitol.</p>
<p>Leading supporters of the bill praised veterans advocacy groups for pushing the bill to completion.</p>
<p>“The turning point in this occurred when last week, in their anger, they let the world know what had happened,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. “And that put the pressure on people to turn their votes around.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Struggle for health care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Passage of the bill marks the end of a years-long struggle by veterans, their family members and veteran service organizations to get the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to provide health care and benefits to military members exposed to burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as Agent Orange in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Currently, veterans have to prove to the federal government that their illnesses are linked to their military service in order to qualify, an endeavor that has been especially challenging for many, including those who have died while waiting.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3373" target="_blank"> measure</a> that cleared Congress Tuesday would change that by adding 23 illnesses to the list of toxic exposure-related conditions presumed to be connected to military service.</p>
<p>The package would direct more resources to VA health care centers, employees and claims processing, as well as federal research on toxic exposure. A statement from Virginia Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine said it would also authorize a new community-based outpatient clinic in Hampton Roads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our nation&#8217;s veterans have sacrificed so much while serving in the armed forces, and we must honor that sacrifice by ensuring they have access to the benefits they&#8217;ve earned and deserve,&#8221; the senators said.</p>
<p>Additionally, the bill would expand presumptions for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, a chemical the U.S. military used during the Vietnam War. American Samoa, Cambodia, Guam, Johnston Atoll, Laos and Thailand would all be added to the list of locations where veterans are presumed to have been exposed to the chemical.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lengthy vote history</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The bill <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-passes-landmark-legislation-aid-veterans-exposed-burn-pits-agent-orange" target="_blank">sailed through the U.S. Senate</a> when it was originally brought to the floor in June with 84 senators <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00230.htm" target="_blank">voting</a> to send the package to the U.S. House.</p>
<p>There it hit a speed bump as Veterans’ Affairs Committee leaders debated behind closed doors how to address a provision intended to boost the number of health care providers in rural or very rural areas.</p>
<p>The section of the bill would have allowed the VA to buy certain health care providers out of their contracts if they agreed to work in clinics in those rural areas for at least four years. But because the legislation proposed making that contract buyout money exempt from taxes, it ran into an objection from the House Ways and Means Committee, which cited what is known as a “blue slip” issue, since tax provisions must begin in the U.S. House.</p>
<p>Lawmakers opted to remove that section from the measure, repackage it into another bill and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-bill-expanding-health-care-benefits-veterans-exposed-burn-pits" target="_blank">put it on the House floor,</a> where members <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022309" target="_blank">voted</a> 342-88 on July 13 to send the legislation back to the U.S. Senate for final approval.</p>
<p>The bill — identical to the version already approved by 84 senators except for the removed section about the contract buyout — was expected to quickly clear the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>But a procedural vote on the bill <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-fails-advance-burn-pits-bill-veterans-dispute-over-spending" target="_blank">failed last week</a> after 25 Republicans switched from supporting the measure to blocking it. The <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00272.htm" target="_blank">vote</a> was 55-42, just shy of the 60 senators needed to get past the chamber’s legislative filibuster.</p>
<p>Toomey, who will retire at the end of the year, organized GOP senators to switch their votes on the legislation, saying that he was frustrated by a “budget gimmick” that has been in the legislation since it was introduced.</p>
<p>Toomey said after he and fellow Republicans blocked the legislation that he had “no quarrel with” the bill creating $278.5 billion in new spending during the next decade that would be classified as “mandatory.”</p>
<p>Mandatory spending by the federal government generally runs on autopilot and includes funding for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Discretionary spending must be approved as part of the annual appropriations process that begins with the president’s budget request and often ends with all 12 government funding bills being wrapped into a $1 trillion-plus omnibus spending package.</p>
<p>Toomey argued last week his opposition to the bill came from a section that “would authorize $400 billion over the next 10 years of existing spending … to be switched from discretionary to mandatory.”</p>
<p>But the unsuccessful cloture vote last week also came shortly after Senate Democrats <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/manchin-and-us-senate-democrats-strike-deal-major-health-climate-tax-package" target="_blank">announced they’d reached an agreement on a surprise reconciliation package</a> that would allow Medicare to negotiate some prescription drug prices, address climate change and energy policy and change some of the country’s tax law.</p>
<p>The reconciliation agreement had been more than a year in the making and included several stops and starts as West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III and Schumer tried to reach an agreement that could get the support of all 50 Senate Democrats.</p>
<p>Republicans are vehemently opposed to the agreement but cannot block it in the Senate because Democrats are using the budget reconciliation process to move it through Congress.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP back on board</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>GOP frustration on the veterans health care bill seemed to wane Monday when <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/stalled-us-senate-bill-veterans-burn-pit-exposure-could-be-revived-week" target="_blank">some Republicans signaled</a> they would back the bill once again.</p>
<p>The change in heart also followed <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/these-people-dont-care-us-senate-gop-stalls-bill-veterans-exposed-burn-pit" target="_blank">an outcry of frustration from veterans</a>, advocates and service organizations, some of whom camped out on the steps of the U.S. Capitol over the weekend and continued protesting in a grassy area just feet from the building this week.</p>
<p>Late night show host Stephen Colbert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-p-_hhOx1U" target="_blank">went after</a> GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Daines for <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2022/07/28/people-have-lost-their-minds-tester-responds-to-toxic-burn-pit-legislation-failing/" target="_blank">a triumphant fist bump</a> after the failure of the bill.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Senate Republicans were also able to negotiate for the chamber to take up three amendments to the legislation, all of which failed to garner the 60 votes needed for adoption.</p>
<p>A proposal from Toomey that would have addressed his concerns on the mandatory spending classification on some funding in the package failed on a 47-48 vote.</p>
<p>Tester wrote in a letter he sent to senators Tuesday that Toomey’s amendment “would potentially harm veterans and tie the hands of Congress.”</p>
<p>“It would arbitrarily cap the number of toxic-exposed veterans that would benefit from the legislation and create a scenario where VA runs out of funds to support these veterans year after year,” Tester wrote.</p>
<p>Toomey argued from the floor that his amendment “has no bearing on how much appropriators can spend, it only limits how much gets treated as mandatory spending.”</p>
<p>Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul’s amendment, which would have paid for the legislation by reprogramming foreign aid spending, fell short of adoption after it got only seven “aye” votes and 90 in opposition.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Blackburn amendment fails</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Another amendment, from Blackburn, would have included access to community care for toxic-exposed veterans and was rejected 48-47.</p>
<p>“If the PACT Act is going to work for veterans, we need to step up and give them access to community care,” Blackburn said ahead of the vote, arguing veterans in her state are waiting too long to get appointments with primary care physicians at VA facilities.</p>
<p>Veterans, under her amendment, would have had the option to “go to a physician in their community for that primary care appointment so they can get this process started,” she said.</p>
<p>“This will help them to avoid the long wait times, the arbitrary hurdles, and it will let them seek that care in the community if they can get it faster than making that trip to the VA,” Blackburn added.</p>
<p>Tester urged senators to reject all three amendments, saying that any change to the legislation would send it back to the U.S. House for another vote, further delaying care for toxic-exposed veterans.</p>
<p>“I would hope that we don&#8217;t amend it to have to go back to the House because that, once again, would delay benefits and do real damage to this bill,” Tester said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer struck an agreement Wednesday for a Democrats-only reconciliation package that would allow negotiations on some Medicare prescription drugs, end corporate tax loopholes and address climate change as well as invest in energy projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden in a statement on Wednesday night offered his support as well, saying the deal will fight inflation and lower costs for American families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a budget process called reconciliation, a bill that draws the support of all 50 Democratic members of the U.S. Senate, with a tie-breaking vote by the vice president, cannot be blocked by Republicans using the filibuster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After many months of negotiations, we have finalized legislative text that will invest approximately $300 billion in Deficit Reduction and $369.75 billion in Energy Security and Climate Change programs over the next ten years,” Manchin and Schumer said in a joint statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The investments will be fully paid for by closing tax loopholes on wealthy individuals and corporations. In addition, the expanded Affordable Care Act program will be extended for three years, through 2025,” they continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement marked a big step forward for a major package after negotiations appeared to break down this month as Manchin objected to federal spending potentially fueling inflation, though </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/climate-change-legislation-still-could-pass-congress-year-manchin-insists" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he maintained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he was still open to a deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The title of the package, which Democrats will try to advance through the Senate next week using the complex budget reconciliation process, will be the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Increase in corporate minimum tax</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/inflation_reduction_act_one_page_summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">summary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the bill says increasing the corporate minimum tax to 15% will bring in $313 billion and that changes allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices will yield $288 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enhanced tax enforcement from the Internal Revenue Service is expected to raise $124 billion in revenue for the federal government, while addressing the carried interest loophole will bring in $14 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That additional funding will more than offset the spending proposed in the package. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats’ estimates show that $369 billion would go towards energy and climate change while extending subsidies for the Affordable Care Act will cost $64 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would mean more than $300 billion in deficit reduction, according to the summary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will make a historic down payment on deficit reduction to fight inflation, invest in domestic energy production and manufacturing, and reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030,” Schumer and Manchin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bill will finally allow Medicare to negotiate for prescription drugs and lower health care costs for millions of Americans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Biden said he’d spoken with Schumer and Manchin and offered his support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the action the American people have been waiting for,” Biden said. “This addresses the problems of today — high health care costs and overall inflation — as well as investments in our energy security for the future.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If enacted, this legislation will be historic,” he added. “I urge the Senate to move on this bill as soon as possible, and for the House to follow as well.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy and climate provisions</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement did not include details of how the $370 billion for energy and climate programs would be spent or where the 40% emissions reduction would come from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s statement said the climate provisions included “tax credits and investments for energy projects.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.manchin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/manchin-supports-inflation-reduction-act-of-2022" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his own statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Manchin, who has financial ties to West Virginia’s coal industry, took a familiar position in opposition to those in his party who favor bolder climate action and said the bill would not seek to eliminate fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must stop pretending that there is only one way to combat global climate change or achieve American energy independence,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising energy costs — and relative scarcity in European countries more dependent on Russian imports — showed that energy reliability and affordability must be balanced with climate impacts, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill includes “strategic and historic investments” in decarbonization that will help U.S. energy be cheaper, cleaner and more reliable, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchin said he supported clean energy development in the long term but didn’t want to abandon fossil fuels that could reduce energy prices immediately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agreement “invests in the technologies needed for all fuel types — from hydrogen, nuclear, renewables, fossil fuels and energy storage — to be produced and used in the cleanest way possible,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[T]his bill does not arbitrarily shut off our abundant fossil fuels. It invests heavily in technologies to help us reduce our domestic methane and carbon emissions and also helps decarbonize around the world as we displace dirtier products.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Praise from progressives</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While details were scarce Wednesday, progressive and environmental groups praised the dollar figure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For months, progressives have advocated for a reconciliation bill on policies with consensus across the Democratic Caucus: climate, health care and tax fairness,” the Congressional Progressive Caucus </span><a href="https://twitter.com/USProgressives/status/1552425773109329920" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We’ll need to evaluate the details, but it’s promising a deal to deliver on those issues might finally be in reach.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With $369 billion for climate and energy provisions, this bill has the potential to be the single largest investment in clean energy in American history,” the climate group Evergreen Action said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agreement calls for separate legislation this fall to update federal permitting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of both parties have complained that federal requirements slow construction, including of energy and transmission projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But environmental advocates say requirements under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act provide essential protections and shouldn’t be undercut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill summary said the permitting reforms would help lower energy costs and would contribute to emissions reductions.</span></p>

At a Senate hearing Tuesday, Republicans said calls to 'defund the police' have lead to more shootings of officers. Democrats said the proliferation of semi-automatic rifles was the problem. (NBC12)</p><p>Republicans on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and law enforcement witnesses at a Tuesday hearing blamed recent violence against officers on anti-police rhetoric, while Democrats distanced themselves from the “defund the police” slogan and said an oversupply of guns made law enforcement jobs more dangerous.</p>
<p>Republicans on the panel raised complaints about general attitudes toward police and members of both parties criticized progressive activists’ calls to “defund the police,” which peaked after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May 2020.</p>
<p>The panel’s ranking Republican, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, requested the hearing. He said 73 police officers were intentionally killed last year, the most since 2001.</p>
<p>“A main cause of this violence against police is the demonization and the disrespect shown to the profession of law enforcement throughout the country,” Grassley said. “When you allow hatred of a group to spread, it makes it easy to justify violent attacks against law enforcement.”</p>
<p>Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, pointed out the committee had approved five bills this year to increase federal funding for local departments. President Joe Biden last week called for even more federal funding, Durbin said.</p>
<p>Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said Congress should also focus on decreasing access to guns.</p>
<p>“There are some on the other side who falsely accuse Democrats [of] wanting to defund the police,” Durbin said in an opening statement. “The record is clear: We are funding the police, and we should. But our work cannot end there. We cannot ignore the dominant role of guns in assaults and killings of police officers.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">George Floyd killing</h4>

	
<p>Republicans on the panel and some witnesses focused on the movement to “defund the police” in the aftermath of the killing of Floyd, a Black man, by a white officer. The term has been interpreted across the political spectrum to mean everything from reforming police departments to abolishing them.</p>
<p>Sgt. Demetrick “Tre” Pennie, the president and executive officer of the National Fallen Officer Foundation, told the panel that “coordinated efforts” to “undermine our police” were responsible for a rise in police deaths.</p>
<p>“As calls to defund the police got louder, more police officers died,” he said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pennie traced a rising anti-police attitude to the 2014 Black Lives Matter protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police officer there killed Michael Brown, an unarmed Black man.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions in the U.S. House, congressional Democrats have rejected the defund-the-police label, and polls show the concept finds disapproval among most Americans.</p>
<p>Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who was the lead prosecutor in the state’s largest county before joining the Senate, said policing practices should be reformed, but not eliminated.</p>
<p>“One of the focuses has got to be … reforming some of the practices, but at the same time funding the police,” she said.</p>
<p>But Republican members of the panel still tied Democrats to the defund slogan.</p>
<p>Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, showed a webpage for ActBlue, a national Democratic fundraising group, that promoted a 13.12-mile run for justice. Hashtagged #DefundThePolice, the event’s fundraising page said the distance was selected because the numerals 1-3-1-2 correspond to the letter A-C-A-B, which stands for “all cops are bastards.”</p>
<p>“This radical concept of defunding the police has gone from the radical left — a minority of the party — to something that the primary fundraising entity from liberal progressives is now touting,” he said. “This is a cancer.”</p>
<p>The panel highlighted the April 2021 fatal shooting of Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Jim Smith. The shooter in that case led police in a chase before hiding in his house. The shooter fired a shotgun at officers as they opened a door in the home.</p>
<p>Former Grundy County Deputy Zach Andersen, who was on the scene when Smith was killed, choked up Tuesday as he related the account to the committee.</p>
<p>He also told the committee the shooter was motivated “by his hatred of law enforcement.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Availability of guns</h4>

	
<p>Durbin said Congress should consider not just rhetoric, but also the availability of guns.</p>
<p>“Some just want to address what’s on the mind of the shooter,” Durbin said. “Some of us want to address what’s in the hand of the shooter, what weapons they bring to terrify or assault a police officer. They’re both relevant.”</p>
<p>AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles are becoming more common in attacks on police and in mass shooting of civilians, Durbin said. An estimated 10 to 20 million such weapons are in the country, he added.</p>
<p>Michael S. Harrison, the commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department and the president of the Police Executive Research Forum, said “proliferation of illegal guns and the availability of guns” was a major factor in making policing more dangerous.</p>
<p>Harrison told Durbin that almost all shooting murders in Baltimore were committed with illegal guns. But he rejected that more legal guns would make the city safer.</p>
<p>“That data does not support that more legal, law-abiding citizens carrying guns makes us safer,” Harrison said.</p>
<p>Harrison praised a recent gun-control law and said more federal funding and partnerships with federal agencies would be welcome.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House bills </h4>

	
<p>The U.S. House Rules Committee is set to consider five police and safety bills Wednesday, setting them up for full House consideration later this week.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, is the lead sponsor of a bill to authorize $50 million per year for a Justice Department grant program to assist small, local police departments.</p>
<p>Another bill would reauthorize a grant program to hire more local police and increase their pay.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Val Demings, a Florida Democrat and former Orlando police chief, sponsored a bill to provide $100 million per year in grants to help police agencies solve violent crimes.</p>
<p>Two other bills would authorize Health and Human Services Department programs to promote mental-health approaches to policing.</p>
<p>One bill would create an HHS grant program to have states and local governments hire mental-health professionals to be sent in lieu of police when a person with a mental illness is involved in an emergency.</p>
<p>Another, sponsored by Nevada Democrat Steven Horsford, would provide $1.5 billion to HHS to fund local violence intervention programs and $1.5 billion to the Labor Department for job training programs for young people in communities affected by gun violence.</p>

</p><p>Donald Trump ignored White House staff, family members and outside advisers who urged the president to call off the mob attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, according to testimony before the U.S. House panel investigating the insurrection at its eighth and final hearing of the summer Thursday night.</p>
<p>Instead, Trump sat in the White House dining room for hours watching the Fox News coverage of the assault, committee leaders said as they laid out new details of the 187 minutes between the end of Trump’s speech on the White House ellipse and his tweet telling rioters to “go home with love and peace.”</p>
<p>Despite the pleas of those closest to him, and despite seeing the violence unfold live on Fox, Trump was unmoved. Trump didn’t fail to act, committee member Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who co-led Thursday’s hearing, said: “He chose not to act.”</p>
<p>Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, underscored that Trump’s refusal to condemn the riot was described by dozens of Republican witnesses, “those who served Donald Trump loyally for years,” she said.</p>
<p>“The case against Donald Trump in these hearings is not made by witnesses who were his political enemies. It is instead a series of confessions by Donald Trump’s own appointees, his own friends, his own campaign officials.”</p>
<p>Here are some details that emerged Thursday night:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump clung until the last minute to the idea that the election wasn’t over</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The panel showed outtakes from Trump’s video message to supporters telling them to leave the Capitol, and from a address the next day. Even as he prepared for those statements, he refused to concede he lost the election.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to say the election is over,” he said in a Jan. 7 outtake, reacting to a line speechwriters included. “I just want to say, &#8216;Now Congress has certified the results,’ without saying.”</p>
<p>The unsubstantiated claim that Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden was illegitimate — and that somehow the result could be overturned — was the concept that motivated the attack.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump heard from many people who wanted him to call off the attack</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>People identified as telling Trump or Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman, that he must condemn the violence included Trump’s children Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., Fox News host Sean Hannity, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and others.</p>
<p>Sarah Matthews, a former communications official for Trump’s reelection campaign who was in the White House on Jan. 6, said she had seen at rallies the power Trump had over his supporters.</p>
<p>“He was the only person in the world who could call off the mob he sent to the Capitol,” Thompson said.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pence’s security detail </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A White House official with national security responsibilities relayed a harrowing account of Vice President Mike Pence’s Secret Service detail. Pence was at the Capitol to conduct his ceremonial role to certify the election results, which <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pence-was-within-40-feet-mob-inflamed-trump-jan-6-committee-reveals" target="_blank">Trump was strongly pressuring</a> him not to do.</p>
<p>The official, whose identity the committee did not disclose because the official feared retribution, heard chaos at the Capitol over a radio.</p>
<p>“There were a lot of there was a lot of yelling a lot of a lot of very personal calls over the radio,” the official said. “I don’t like talking about it, but they were calling to say goodbye to family members.”</p>
<p>The rioters’ anger was focused on Pence, U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, a Virginia Democrat who co-led Thursday’s hearing, said, after Trump tweeted at 2:24 p.m. that Pence didn’t have “the courage” to overturn the vote. “He put a target on his own vice president’s back,” Luria said.</p>
<p>The panel showed video of Secret Service agents hustling Pence and his team to a secure location.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hawley’s jog.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Hours after pumping his fist in solidarity with Trump supporters, the committee showed video of Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley jogging away from the Senate chamber as the mob approached.</p>
<p>Hawley later voted not to certify the election results.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Cipollone considered resigning on Jan. 6</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The top White House lawyer decided against stepping down because he was worried about who would replace him, he told the panel in taped testimony.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Records don’t exist</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The White House phone log does not include any entries from 11:06 a.m. to 6:54 p.m., though the president was making and taking calls during those hours, the committee said.</p>
<p>Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a taped deposition that she gave Trump a list of senators and that the president called them to urge them not to certify the election results.</p>
<p>Alabama Republican U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville said on a local television news station in February that Trump called him as he prepared to evacuate the Capitol.</p>
<p>The committee also has phone records of Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, which show the two spoke twice in that timeframe.</p>
<p>The White House daily diary is also blank from 1:21 p.m. to 4:03 p.m. on Jan. 6, Luria said.</p>
<p>And the official White House photographer was told not to take photographs as Trump went into the Rose Garden to record a video message to supporters.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">See you in September</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The panel will not hold another public hearing until September, Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said. Thompson, who has tested positive for COVID-19, appeared virtually.</p>
<p>The panel will continue its work over Congress’ August recess, Cheney said.</p>

(Alex Kent/ For the Tennessee Lookout)</p><p>The U.S. House committee investigating the Jan.6 attack and Donald Trump’s role in it will focus in a Thursday evening hearing on the former president’s refusal for more than three hours to call off the rioters storming the U.S. Capitol, committee aides said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Committee members Elaine Luria, a Democrat from Norfolk, and Illinois Republican Adam Kinzinger will lead the Thursday’s hearing, aides said. Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, will participate remotely after he tested positive for COVID-19 this week.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s seen as risky for Luria in particular as she seeks re-election in a redrawn district that has become more conservative, but she told the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-veterans-virginia-adam-kinzinger-government-and-politics-d894f4671dcf21b5e2427c5d209f368c" target="_blank">Associated Press previously</a> that the committee&#8217;s work is more important than her political prospects.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepElaineLuria/status/1546947202987196416?s=20&#038;t=tDBpCU50liDveVXdeKbKRw</p>
<p>The hearing will be the eighth in the panel’s series to document its findings but is the first evening meeting since its initial presentation last month. It will begin at 8 p.m. ET and can be watched on a livestream <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>The committee leaders once indicated the series would comprise eight major public hearings, but aides now say more are likely, as the panel has heard from additional witnesses since the start of public meetings.</p>
<p>“There is potential for future hearings,” a committee aide said. “As we continue to gather evidence, continue to hear from witnesses, the committee will make a determination.”</p>
<p>The hearing will examine Trump’s actions in the 187 minutes between the end of his speech on the White House Ellipse at about 1:10 p.m. on Jan. 6, 2021, and when he tweeted a video asking his supporters to leave the Capitol at 4:17 p.m., aides said.</p>
<p>Trump knew of the violence happening at the Capitol, where Congress was scheduled to certify the 2020 election results, aides said. Trump was the only person with the power to call off the attack, but declined to do so, the committee will show, according to aides.</p>
<p>Rather than intervene, Trump inflamed the mob with a tweet about Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
<p>Wendy Via, the president and cofounder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, a group that has provided expert analysis to the committee, said in a Wednesday interview that the Pence tweet “shows intent” to incite a riot to disrupt the transfer of power.</p>
<p>Trump knew or should have known that tweet would agitate the crowd, she said.</p>
<p>The panel will show who in the White House, including Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman, spoke to Trump on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>The panel has not announced which witnesses will testify live, citing security concerns.</p>
<p>Testimony from the deposition of Trump White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, whom the committee questioned last week after it had already conducted six hearings, is expected to be a major part of the hearing.</p>
<p>Cipollone provided information on every aspect of Trump’s plan to overturn the election result, which the committee has detailed over its seven previous hearings, aides said.</p>
<p>The panel changed course and reordered the information it presented as more testimony came in, Via said. Cipollone coming forward “was huge,” she said.</p>
<p>Former Meadows aide Cassidy Hutchinson also provided much more information midway through the series after she changed her legal team. Hutchinson was the sole witness at <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-had-be-physically-restrained-joining-jan-6-mob-house-panel-told" target="_blank">a surprise hearing</a> last month that detailed Trump’s activities on Jan. 6 and the days leading up to it.</p>

(NBC12)</p><p>With U.S. Senate negotiations over climate funding stalled, President Joe Biden on Wednesday directed additional spending to help states and cities manage climate disasters — resisting calls from many congressional Democrats to take more aggressive executive action like a declaration of a national climate emergency.</p>
<p>Biden also announced steps executive agencies are taking to expand offshore wind development into the Gulf of Mexico and provide funding for local cooling centers.</p>
<p>Dangerous heat waves have become more common in recent years. The United Kingdom and other parts of Europe are currently experiencing record heat and fires.</p>
<p>In the U.S., heat alerts in effect Wednesday covered 100 million people, Biden said during an appearance at a former coal plant in Somerset, Massachusetts. Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey as well as Rep. Jake Auchincloss, all Democrats, and Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse accompanied him.</p>
<p>The administration moves fall far short of what several Democrats in Congress and environmental advocates had urged the president to do after talks between conservative-leaning Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York about a broad climate spending and tax plan appeared to collapse last week. Manchin’s vote would be needed for so-called reconciliation legislation to advance in the evenly divided Senate.</p>
<p>Manchin <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/climate-change-legislation-still-could-pass-congress-year-manchin-insists" target="_blank">said</a> he could be open to climate legislation later this summer, but only if he saw favorable inflation figures next month.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who chairs the subcommittee that directs environmental funding, told reporters this week that the apparent dead end of Senate climate talks “unchained” Biden from waiting for legislative action. Merkley called on the administration to “pivot to a very aggressive climate strategy.”</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YnvXoVCcCM"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/08/20/yes-virginia-we-are-seeing-more-and-more-intense-rainfall/">Yes, Virginia, we are seeing more — and more intense — rainfall</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Merkley and Whitehouse voiced several options for executive action, including using the Defense Production Act to spur production of clean energy materials like solar panels, halting approvals of oil and gas projects and enacting new Environmental Protection Agency regulations.</p>
<p>An administration official told reporters earlier Wednesday that Biden was acting because he recognized that the Democratic-controlled Congress would not soon pass a climate bill. Biden said more executive actions would arrive “in coming days.”</p>
<p><b>​​</b>“Climate change is literally an existential threat to our nation and to the world,” Biden said. “This is an emergency – an emergency – and I will look at it that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>“As president, I’ll use my executive power to combat the climate crisis in the absence of congressional action,” he continued.</p>
<p>“We’re going to keep taking climate action every single day because that’s been part and parcel of this administration’s focus,” a senior administration official told reporters. “This is one of the four crises the president defined when he was inaugurated.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Heat waves, drought</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Wednesday’s actions include $2.3 billion for a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant program to help communities build resilience to climate events like heat waves, drought, wildfire and flooding.</p>
<p>That figure is the largest allocation in the program’s history, the administration official said.</p>
<p>The president also directed the Interior Department to propose areas for offshore wind power development in the southern Atlantic Ocean and off Florida’s Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>Following Biden’s remarks, the Interior Department and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said they were reviewing plans to allow offshore wind near Galveston, Texas, and Lake Charles, Louisiana. Together, the sites make up more than 700,000 acres and could power 3.1 million homes, the department said.</p>
<p>The department will also conduct an environmental assessment of possible consequences of allowing wind development across 30 million acres of the Gulf.</p>
<p>The U.S. Health and Human Services Department also released <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ocs/policy-guidance/liheap-im-2022-06-heat-stress-flexibilities-and-resources-fy2022" target="_blank">guidance</a> Wednesday to help states and local governments respond to heat emergencies.</p>
<p>The guidance allows states and local governments to use funds from the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill passed in Biden’s first months in office to secure air-conditioning units and provide cooling centers.</p>

Joe Manchin (D-WV) is followed by reporters as he arrives for a caucus meeting with Senate Democrats at the U.S. Capitol Building on December 16, 2021 in Washington, DC.

Joe Manchin III on Friday held open the prospect of Congress passing significant climate legislation yet this year, denying reports he’s tanked the effort by walking away from talks with leadership.</p>
<p>The reports have brought a flood of criticism for Manchin from fellow members of Congress, who say the very survival of the planet is at stake.</p>
<p>Manchin, a moderate West Virginia Democrat, gains unusual national attention for his remarks because he is in the center of his party’s negotiations over a major spending bill and represents a crucial vote in the evenly divided Senate.</p>
<p>Manchin on a West Virginia radio station talk show on Friday said he told Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that after June’s consumer price index <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/briefs/u-s-inflation-hits-a-40-year-high-in-june-but-biden-points-to-decreasing-gas-prices/" target="_blank">showed a 9.1 percent increase,</a> he wanted to wait to see July’s inflation numbers and Federal Reserve interest rates before deciding what clean energy programs and tax changes he could support.</p>
<p>“Let’s wait until that comes out so that we know that we’re going down the path that won’t be inflammatory to add more to inflation,” Manchin said he told Schumer, a New York Democrat.</p>
<p>“Inflation is absolutely killing many, many people… Can’t we wait to make sure that we do nothing to add to that?”</p>
<p>Schumer “took that as ‘no,’ I guess and came out with this big thing last night,” Manchin told Hoppy Kercheval, the host of the Metronews Talkline radio show in West Virginia.</p>
<p>The New York Democrat or someone close to him then told The Washington Post that talks were dead, Manchin implied.</p>
<p>The Post published a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/07/14/manchin-climate-tax-bbb/" target="_blank">story</a> Thursday night saying Manchin told Democratic leaders he wouldn’t support new climate programs or raising taxes on the wealthy.</p>
<p>Manchin seemed surprised by the Washington Post report, saying during a 15-minute interview with Kercheval that Schumer’s team knew where the West Virginian stood and that the sides had made major progress in the past few months.</p>
<p>He seemed to view the leak as a negotiating ploy, rejecting the conclusion that talks were at an end or even seriously set back.</p>
<p>“I’m not stopping,” he said. “This is rhetoric. I’ve been through this all my life, politically. I’ve never seen it at this level… thinking they’re going to put all this pressure on me. I am where I have been. I would not put my staff through this, I would not put myself through this if I wasn’t sincere.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reconciliation bill</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Manchin said Schumer wanted an agreement by the end of July on a budget reconciliation bill — a legislative tool that would allow Senate Democrats to pass legislation with a simple majority vote, which they’d gain with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a tie. Inflation figures for July will not be released until August, when the Senate will be in a month-long recess.</p>
<p>Manchin has also set a Sept. 30 deadline to reach a deal on a spending bill, making the four weeks the chamber is in session in September a crucial period.</p>
<p>That tight timeline was not an obstacle, he said Friday.</p>
<p>“We could come back the first of September and pass this legislation,” he said. “If it’s a good piece of legislation.”</p>
<p>Manchin said he thought he was “close” to a deal with Schumer.</p>
<p>“I thought we were,” he said. “I thought we were moving truly in the right direction.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy policy differences</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Manchin, who has financial ties to his state’s coal industry, said he supports spending for clean energy programs, but had disagreements with Democratic colleagues who he said wanted to eliminate production of oil, gas and coal.</p>
<p>That may happen in 20 years, but would not be possible in the next decade, Manchin said.</p>
<p>The U.S. should instead work on making fossil fuel production cleaner and on developing non-fossil fuel sources, including hydrogen and nuclear, he said.</p>
<p>Carbon emissions from fossil fuels are the dominant cause of global warming, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>
<p>The international group has called for significant reductions to fossil fuel emissions in order to curb the worst effects of climate change. President Joe Biden has joined international efforts to reduce carbon emissions, including cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 50% of 2005 levels by 2030.</p>
<p>The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/build-back-better/#:~:text=The%20Build%20Back%20Better%20framework%20will%20provide%20monthly%20payments%20to,child%20ages%206%20to%2017." target="_blank">proposed</a> — and the Democratic-controlled House <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/house-democrats-pass-bidens-185-trillion-build-back-better-plan-1" target="_blank">passed</a> last year — more than $550 billion for climate programs, mostly tax credits for energy producers that use renewable sources.</p>
<p>Manchin’s objections sidelined that bill in December.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Manchin ‘whims’ criticized</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Climate advocates in and out of Congress slammed Manchin on Friday, reacting to apparent news he had again blocked even a slimmed-down climate bill.</p>
<p>“Like most Americans right now, I am sickened that the changing whims of one man could put the very near future of our country, our planet, and our health and safety on the brink,” U.S. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl M. Grijalva of Arizona said in a statement. “I think it’s shortsighted at best, reckless endangerment at worst.”</p>
<p>Grijalva also blamed Republicans for the impasse.</p>
<p>“It’s infuriating and nothing short of tragic that Senator Manchin is walking away, again, from taking essential action on climate and clean energy,” Minnesota Democratic Sen. Tina Smith said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The world is literally burning while he joins every single Republican to stop strong action to cut emissions and speed the transition to clean energy for the survival of our planet.”</p>
<p>“We have an opportunity to address the climate crisis right now,” U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, who sits on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that Manchin chairs, <a href="https://twitter.com/MartinHeinrich/status/1547966848389373953" target="_blank">wrote on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>“Senator Manchin’s refusal to act is infuriating,” Heinrich added. “It makes me question why he’s Chair of ENR.”</p>
<p>“This failure falls squarely on Joe Manchin and the Republicans, as do the barren croplands, flooded homes, and incinerated communities that will result from this inaction,” said Manish Bapna, the president and CEO of environmental group NRDC Action Fund. “One of those Senators must reconsider.”</p>
<p>Representatives for Schumer, who has been absent from the Senate with COVID-19, did not respond to a message seeking comment Friday.</p>

<p>Trump exerted extraordinary influence over the mob, who marched to the Capitol on his orders and undertook the violent attack, testimony showed. Many dispersed only when Trump asked them to do so, hours after mayhem broke out.</p>
<p>Members of the violent extremist groups Proud Boys and Oath Keepers and other Trump supporters interpreted a Dec. 19 tweet from Trump to attend a “wild” Jan. 6 rally in Washington as a call to arms to fight election certification, according to testimony at the  wide-ranging hearing, the seventh by the panel.</p>
<p>The three-hour session touched on the former president’s social media influence, a militia group’s desire for Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act and a shouting match between White House staff and outside Trump advisers over whether to try to cancel the results of the election.</p>
<p>Democratic members Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Stephanie Murphy of Florida led the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Will be wild’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Much of the committee’s discussion centered on a 1:42 a.m. tweet from Trump on Dec. 19, 2020.</p>
<p>“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!” Trump wrote.</p>
<p>“When Donald Trump sent out his tweet, he became the first president to call for a crowd to descend on the capital city to block the constitutional transfer of power,” Raskin said.</p>
<p>Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said both violent extremists and “average Trump supporters swept up in the fervor of the day” participated in the attack, and the panel heard testimony from one of each type.</p>
<p>Stephen Ayres, a northeast Ohio man who participated in the assault on the Capitol, testified that Trump’s tweet inspired him to travel to Washington.</p>
<p>Ayres told the panel he’d been interested in his family affairs and ordinary hobbies but was “pretty hardcore into the social media,” he said. He believed Trump and was angered by the president’s claims that the election was stolen, he said.</p>
<p>On Jan. 6, Ayres said he “was worked up” by Trump’s speech on the White House Ellipse. He joined an angry group that marched to the Capitol after Trump directed them there.</p>
<p>“Basically, the president got everybody riled up, told everybody, ‘Head on down,’” he said. “So we basically were just following what he said.”</p>
<p>Ayres and the crowd expected Trump to join them, he said.</p>
<p>Ayres only left the Capitol after Trump tweeted a video instructing his supporters to do so.</p>
<p>“We literally left right when that come out,” he told the panel. “If he would have done that earlier in the day, we wouldn’t be in this bad of a situation.”</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tweeting to the extremists</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>None answered Trump’s call faster than dangerous extremist groups, who interpreted it as a call to arms and immediately began organizing, Raskin said.</p>
<p>“Seizing upon his invitation to fight, they assembled their followers for an insurrectionary showdown against Congress and the vice president,” he said.</p>
<p>The mob Trump summoned “came prepared to do battle against police and politicians alike,” Thompson said.</p>
<p>A former Oath Keeper, Jason Van Tatenhove, testified that the group’s leader, Stewart Rhodes, routinely sought ways to legitimize the organization and said Trump’s messaging would have encouraged him.</p>
<p>Van Tatenhove left the organization before the lead up to Jan. 6. He called the Oath Keepers “a very dangerous organization” controlled personally by Rhodes.</p>
<p>Rhodes sees himself as “a paramilitary leader” and wanted Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act — which lets a president deploy the military inside U.S. borders for the purposes of law enforcement — to allow for paramilitary action on Jan. 6, Van Tatenhove said.</p>
<p>Messaging from Trump in advance of the attack “gave (Rhodes) the nod” to pursue a violent agenda that could have sparked a second civil war, Van Tatenhove said.</p>
<p>Rhodes and other Oath Keepers have been indicted for seditious conspiracy related to the Jan. 6 attack.</p>
<p>Van Tatenhove said he joined the Oath Keepers after meeting them at the stand-off at Cliven Bundy’s Nevada ranch in 2014. At the time he left the Oath Keepers, he lived in a small town in Montana. He now <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/07/12/jason-van-tatenhove-jan-6-committee/" target="_blank">resides in Estes Park, Colorado</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ties to Proud Boys, Oath Keepers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump advisers Roger Stone and retired Gen. Mike Flynn had ties to the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, Raskin said.</p>
<p>Stone communicated regularly with both groups between the November election and Jan. 6, Raskin said.</p>
<p>Flynn was photographed on Dec. 18, 2020, walking with indicted Oath Keeper Roberto Minuta and Rhodes, the committee showed.</p>
<p>Rhodes was in Washington for a Trump event on Dec. 12 and called for Trump to invoke martial law, Raskin said.</p>
<p>“If he does not do it now, we’re going to have to do it ourselves later in a much more desperate, much more bloody war,” Rhodes said in a video shown Tuesday.</p>
<figure id="attachment_24377" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2048px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DC-riot-2.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-24377" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DC-riot-2.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1366" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DC-riot-2.jpg 2048w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DC-riot-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DC-riot-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DC-riot-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DC-riot-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DC-riot-2-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DC-riot-2-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DC-riot-2-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DC-riot-2-1920x1281.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Police clash with Trump supporters during a riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. (Alex Kent/ For the Tennessee Lookout)</p></figure>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump knew of danger</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Katrina Pierson, a former Trump campaign staffer who helped plan the Jan. 6 rally, reached out to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Jan. 2, concerned that speakers planning to speak at the rally were dangerous.</p>
<p>“Things have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction,” Pierson said in a text message the committee showed Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a phone call eight minutes later, Pierson told Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman, that some speakers “were very suspect,” she told the committee in taped testimony.</p>
<p>The panel also showed evidence Trump planned to send supporters to the Capitol, though he didn’t publicly say that until his Jan. 6 speech.</p>
<p>Allies in right-wing circles anticipated that Trump would “unexpectedly” initiate a march toward Congress, according to a Jan. 4 text message the committee obtained from rally organizer Kylie Kremer to MyPillow CEO and pro-Trump conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell.</p>
<p>In a Jan. 5 meeting, Trump asked White House staff about the best route from the White House to the Capitol, former White House photographer Shealah Craighead said in taped testimony.</p>
<p>Several right-wing media personalities, including Steve Bannon, a former Trump campaign manager who remained in contact with the president, promoted that Jan. 6 would be more than a presidential speech at the White House.</p>
<p>Bannon and Trump spoke for 11 minutes on Jan. 5, Murphy said, citing White House call logs. Following that conversation, Bannon spoke on his own podcast.</p>
<p>“All hell is going to break loose tomorrow,” he said. “It&#8217;s all converging, and now we’re on, as they say, the point of attack.”</p>
<p>Bannon and Trump spoke again for six minutes later in the day, Murphy said.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-had-be-physically-restrained-joining-jan-6-mob-house-panel-told" target="_blank">a previous hearing</a>, the committee heard that Trump had been informed before sending them to the Capitol that his supporters were armed.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed"> ‘I feel guilty’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In another text exchange with Pierson, former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale blamed Trump’s rhetoric for the violence and the death of one supporter, Ashli Babbitt.</p>
<p>“I feel guilty for helping him win,” Parscale texted Pierson on the evening of Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Pierson responded that Trump’s rhetoric wasn’t responsible for the violence.</p>
<p>“Katrina,” Parscale wrote back. “Yes it was.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘UNHINGED’ meeting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump’s Dec. 19 tweet followed an all-night White House meeting that devolved into a verbal brawl between Trump outside advisers who sought to overturn the election and White House lawyers who thought those efforts were “a terrible idea,” in the words of former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who gave a deposition to the committee only last week.</p>
<p>The meeting started with Flynn and attorneys Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani gaining direct access to Trump without any White House staff present for 10 to 15 minutes, according to Powell. All three favored trying to overturn the election.</p>
<p>Once Cipollone found out what was happening, he raced to the Oval Office.</p>
<p>In taped testimony to the committee, mutual animosity between the two camps seemed to have lingered.</p>
<p>“I bet Pat Cipollone set a new land-speed record,” Powell told the panel in a deposition, referring to the White House counsel breaking up the Dec. 18 meeting.</p>
<p>“I was not happy to see the people who were in the Oval Office,” Cipollone said. “I did not think any of these people were providing the president with good advice. I didn’t understand how they had gotten in.”</p>
<p>Joined by other White House lawyers, including senior adviser Eric Herschmann, the meeting became an insult-laden shouting match.</p>
<p>“It got to the point where the screaming was completely out there,” Herschmann said. “What they were proposing, I thought was nuts.”</p>
<p>“A general disregard for actually backing up what you say with facts,” Cipollone said of the outside advisers.</p>
<p>Powell said the White House lawyers were showing “disdain” for Trump.</p>
<p>“I’m going to categorically describe it as, ‘You guys are not tough enough,’” Giuliani said in taped testimony. “Or maybe I put it another way: ‘You guys are a bunch of p&#8212;ies.’ Excuse the expression.”</p>
<p>Overhearing the meeting, Meadows aide Cassidy Hutchinson texted another staffer, “The West Wing is UNHINGED.”</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Meeting with GOP House members</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The committee also documented a Dec. 21 meeting Trump had with Republican House members to strategize about how to reverse the election results.</p>
<p>Members who attended included Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar of Arizona, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Andy Harris of Maryland, Jody Hice of Georgia, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Brian Babin and Louie Gohmert of Texas.</p>
<p>Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who’d been elected but was not yet a member of Congress, was also present, according to the committee.</p>
<p>The Dec. 21 meeting centered, in part, on Vice President Mike Pence’s role in verifying Electoral College votes and on the pursuit of Trump outside lawyer John Eastman’s strategy to replace legitimate slates of electors in several states with fake electors who would cast ballots for Trump.</p>
<p>Asked about the committee’s assertion, Greene spokesman Nick Dwyer said the description was “all wrong” and that Greene had been focused on objecting to Electoral College votes from certain states Trump lost.</p>
<p>Dwyer forwarded a video Greene posted to Facebook on Dec. 21 leaving the White House.</p>
<p>“We had a great planning session for our Jan. 6 objection,” Greene said in the video. “We aren’t going to let this election be stolen by Joe Biden and the Democrats. Donald Trump won in a landslide.”</p>
<p>Gaetz tweeted Tuesday that the meeting was collegial.</p>
<p>“Pence actually joined this meeting,” he wrote. “We ate Swedish meatballs in the Cabinet Room. Pence thanked us all for our service there.”</p>
<p>Representatives for the other named House members did not return requests for comment Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Witness interference</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the hearing, Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said that Trump had recently personally called a witness whose testimony had not yet been publicized.</p>
<p>The witness did not take the call and instead called their lawyer, who told the committee. The committee referred it to the Justice Department as possible witness intimidation.</p>
<p>“We will take any effort to influence witness testimony very seriously,” she said.</p>
<p>The committee’s next hearing, next week, will provide a “minute-by-minute” account of Jan. 6 and will include more from Cipollone’s deposition, Cheney said.</p>

(Getty Images)</p><p>Just before the July 4 holiday, the federal agency that manages offshore energy development proposed a five-year plan for as many as 11 and as few as zero new oil and gas sites in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska’s coast.</p>
<p>The proposal would clear the way for up to 10 new oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf and <a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/briefs/biden-adminstration-offshore-oil-plan-envisions-a-single-cook-inlet-sale/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=2d4083db-a8e6-4567-a7c2-2a7fef2a33bf" target="_blank">one in federal waters of Cook Inlet </a> — a significant decrease from the 47 lease sales proposed under a 2018 Trump administration draft plan.</p>
<p>But it’s still not enough of a reduction to satisfy climate hawks who say that no amount of new oil and gas development is safe.</p>
<p>Here are five major questions about the proposal:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What does the plan actually do?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The proposal, put out by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, is an intermediate step between a draft and a final program.</p>
<p>In a July 1 <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-invites-public-comment-proposed-five-year-program-offshore-oil-0" target="_blank">release</a>, Interior said the new proposal was narrowed to include only sites in the Gulf and Cook Inlet because there is existing production and infrastructure there. The proposal matches the Obama administration’s five-year plan, which ran from 2017 to 2022 and also approved 10 sites in the Gulf and one off of Alaska’s coast.</p>
<p>The 11 sites in the proposal would be the maximum allowed in a final plan. Interior could remove any in its final program proposal, expected later this year.</p>
<p>After Interior Secretary Deb Haaland approves a final plan, BOEM would hold up to two auctions each year through 2028 for the Gulf sites. Rights to the Alaska site would be auctioned in 2026. Interior could also choose not to conduct sales of sites approved in the final plan.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will this make gas cheaper right away?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The leases — if they’re approved — won’t be auctioned for months. Once they are, it will take about five years for operations to begin in the shallowest areas and even longer for whatever oil is retrieved there to reach the market.</p>
<p>In some cases, it would take more than a decade before oil companies could begin production on a new lease, according to the draft proposal.</p>
<p>The long lead time means new leases would have virtually no immediate impact on prices at the pump, Stephen Miller, a professor of economics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas’ Center for Business and Economic Research, said in an email.</p>
<p>The proposal to grant new leases “will not exert any significant effect on current gas prices as the time lags involved before such leases could yield tangible products are measured in multiple years,” Miller wrote.</p>
<p>Sara Teel, an economist with the Alaska Department of Labor &amp; Workforce Development, said Cook Inlet development in particular would have little impact on gasoline prices, as the site mainly produces natural gas.</p>
<p>Also, the proposed plan tentatively scheduled the Cook Inlet auction for 2026, when market conditions could be quite different, Teel said.</p>
<p>Still, proponents of increased drilling have used current high oil and gas prices as a rationale for expanding development.</p>
<p>U.S. House Natural Resources Committee ranking Republican Bruce Westerman of Arkansas implied the timing of the plan’s announcement — 5 p.m. the day before a holiday weekend — was meant to keep attention away.</p>
<p>“Well, Americans noticed,” he said in a statement. “How couldn&#8217;t we, when we&#8217;re paying more and more each time we fill up our cars with gas? DOI&#8217;s statement that the final plan may contain zero lease sales is deeply concerning and would be unprecedented. This administration continues demolishing access to American resources, and we are paying the price at the pump, at the grocery store and in our family budgets.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed"> What does this mean for climate change?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>It depends, and opinions vary.</p>
<p>The scientific consensus calls for phasing out fossil fuels as soon as possible. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said keeping global warming to a 1.5 degrees Celsius rise — the benchmark estimated to be needed to prevent the worst potential climate change impacts —  would require reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has set a goal of reaching net-zero emissions, meaning the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced is no more than the amount removed from the atmosphere, by 2050, and a 50 perent reduction from 2005 levels by the end of this decade.</p>
<p>Issuing new lease sales, which would mean likely oil and gas development well into the 2030s, would threaten those goals, environmental advocates say.</p>
<p>“It would mean a continuing of the status quo, which is already a disaster for people in the Gulf South,” said Kendall Dix, the national policy director for the environmental group Gulf Coast Center for Law and Policy. “We’re already seeing impacts of the climate crisis.”</p>
<p>The proposed plan acknowledges that “to meet these targets, the U.S. will have to drastically change both the way it consumes and also supplies energy, whereby an increase in renewable energy production, electrification, energy efficiency and reduced consumption assumes less reliance on oil and gas resources and reduced demand.”</p>
<p>But eliminating the supply of domestic offshore oil and gas may not be an effective way to meet those targets, the proposal says.</p>
<p>As long as energy demand remains the same, any reduction in offshore fossil fuel production would have to be filled by other sources of energy, likely fossil fuels, the proposal says.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who’s happy about this?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Basically no one.</p>
<p>The range of options — from zero to 11 new leases in the next five years — frustrated advocates across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>Environmental advocates say any new oil and gas infrastructure would be giving up on Biden’s campaign pledge to aggressively pursue climate solutions.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration had an opportunity to meet the moment on climate and end new offshore oil leasing in Interior’s five-year program,” Drew Caputo, the vice president of litigation at the environmental group Earthjustice, said in a statement. “Instead, its proposal to serve up a bunch of new offshore oil lease sales is a failure of climate leadership and a breach of their climate promises.”</p>
<p>Even in Biden’s own party, congressional leaders on energy policy were split about whether the proposal allowed too much or too little development.</p>
<p>“Holding any new offshore oil and gas lease sales over the next five years is a lose-lose for Americans,” U.S. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raúl M. Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“It will do nothing to help lower prices at the pump, and it will make our emissions goals virtually impossible to achieve … Adding any new lease sales to that equation while the climate crisis is unfolding all around us is nonsensical.”</p>
<p>“I am disappointed to see that ‘zero’ lease sales is even an option on the table,” Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Joe Manchin III, a Democrat from West Virginia, said.</p>
<p>“I hope the administration will ultimately greenlight a plan that will expand domestic energy production, done in the cleanest way possible, while also taking the necessary steps to get our offshore leasing program back on track to give the necessary market signals to provide price relief for every American.”</p>
<p>The American Petroleum Institute, the trade group representing U.S. oil and gas producers, also said in a statement that it opposed a no new lease sales policy.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">So why did the Biden administration do this?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Five-year plans for offshore leasing are required by law and the previous plan, approved under President Barack Obama in 2016, expired June 30. Without a plan, the agency cannot issue new leases.</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress hammered the administration for not having a five-year plan ready by the time the Obama-era one expired.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Garret Graves, the ranking member on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, said it was the first time the offshore leasing program had a lapse.</p>
<p>“It should have never happened — the Department of Interior literally had years to plan for it and still have additional steps to go,” the Louisiana Republican said. “Their self-imposed delays are contributing to higher prices, less certainty and more dependence on Iran, Venezuela and others.”</p>
<p>Biden has made no secret of his ambition to slow oil and gas production in federal waters and on federal lands. After campaigning on addressing the climate crisis, one of his first acts as president was to pause offshore and onshore oil and gas leasing.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2021/06/16/federal-judge-halts-biden-pause-on-new-oil-and-gas-leases-across-the-u-s/" target="_blank">federal judge ruled last year</a> that the administration had to restart leases, saying federal law required periodic lease sales and only Congress could change that law. The administration <a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2021/08/25/biden-administration-to-restart-oil-and-gas-leasing/" target="_blank">announced it was restarting </a>lease sales two months after that decision.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether the ruling had any impact on this month’s proposed plan.</p>
<p>The presence of a no leases option in the proposal, though, indicates Interior does believe it has the authority to not hold new lease sales, Dix said.</p>
<p>An Interior spokesperson declined to answer questions about to what extent last year’s ruling influenced the proposal.</p>

Hamilton St. in Richmond. The facility is one of 16 abortion clinics across Virginia. (Courtesy of the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood)</p><p>A group of Democratic governors urged President Joe Biden on Friday to use federal facilities to provide access to abortions, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade last week.</p>
<p>In a video conference with nine governors, including Kate Brown of Oregon, Roy Cooper of North Carolina, Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico and Jared Polis of Colorado, Biden called <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-overturns-right-abortion-landmark-decision-16" target="_blank">the court’s ruling</a> “tragic” and said he shared “the public outrage” about it. He repeated pledges to use the federal government to continue abortion access where it still exists, and called for electing more Democrats to expand protections.</p>
<p>Lujan Grisham and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul encouraged Biden to use federal facilities, such as Veterans Affairs hospitals, military bases and Indian Health Service clinics, to offer abortion access.</p>
<p>“We ask that you consider your ability to use federal facilities,” Hochul said, including “places where the federal government controls the jurisdiction in some of the states that are hostile to women’s rights and make sure that those services are available to other women.”</p>
<p>Lujan Grisham added that Native nations in her state have told her they would allow abortion services at IHS facilities.</p>
<p>“That may be yet another vehicle that we could expand that would protect women and particularly minority populations all across the country,” she said.</p>
<p>Some congressional Democrats have also urged Biden to allow abortion clinics to operate on federal lands in states that restrict access to the procedure.</p>
<p>Asked about that possibility Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-hhs-chief-vows-protect-abortion-access" target="_blank">said all options are on the table.</a></p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-says-he-supports-filibuster-exception-abortion-rights-legislation" target="_blank">he did the day of the ruling</a>, Biden said the federal government would protect the right to cross state lines in pursuit of an abortion and ensure that approved medications would remain available.</p>
<p>And he repeated <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-says-he-supports-filibuster-exception-abortion-rights-legislation" target="_blank">a position he took Thursday</a> that the Senate should make an exception to the filibuster, a rule requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation, to codify the protections that had been in place under Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>Two Democrats in the evenly split U.S. Senate have said they oppose changing the filibuster, meaning Democrats would have to gain new seats in November’s midterm elections for a chance to pass a federal abortion bill, he said.</p>
<p>Biden sharpened campaign-style lines urging voters to send more Democrats who favor abortion rights to Congress and saying Republicans posed a threat to abortion access nationwide.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re going to be in a situation where the Republicans are going to pass a nationwide prohibition, consistent with what the Supreme Court ruled,” he said. “So there&#8217;s a lot at stake here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cooper, the head of the national campaign group Democratic Governors Association, said he would “hold the line” against any efforts by the Republican legislature to restrict abortion access in his state. Cooper added that more Democratic state lawmakers would help him sustain vetoes.</p>
<p>The meeting came a week after <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/06/24/updated-u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">the court ruled</a> in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that a right to an abortion is not guaranteed in the Constitution.</p>
<p>The ruling allowed each state to set its own abortion laws, almost immediately creating a patchwork of access to the procedure throughout the country.</p>
<p>“For now at least, where you live is going to determine your rights,” Cooper said. “It&#8217;s up to the states to determine whether women can get reproductive health care.”</p>
<p>But while each state can now set its own laws on abortion access, even states that haven’t altered their approach after the court’s ruling are being affected, Cooper said. As other southeastern states ban or restrict access, Planned Parenthood clinics in the Tar Heel State expect an additional 10,000 patients from out of state in the next year, he said.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes of the meeting was open to the press and live streamed. The conversation appeared set to continue after press access ended, with Biden asking the governors to consider what they would do in his position.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?521439-2/supreme-court-holds-swearing-ceremony-ketanji-brown-jackson" target="_blank">The swearing-in ceremony</a> at the Supreme Court making Jackson’s place in history official took barely three minutes and capped a months-long process that began when Breyer announced in January he intended to step down at the end of the court term.</p>
<p>Jackson’s husband, Patrick, held two Bibles upon which Jackson swore her oath. One was a family edition and one had been donated to the court in 1906 by Justice John Marshall Harlan, the only justice to dissent in the infamous Plessy v. Ferguson case that upheld racial segregation.</p>
<p>Roberts administered the constitutional oath, while Breyer, for whom Jackson clerked two decades ago, administered the judicial oath. Roberts and Breyer were dressed in black robes while Jackson wore a navy dress.</p>
<p>“On behalf of all of the members of the court, I am pleased to welcome Justice Jackson to the court and to our common calling,” Roberts said to close the ceremony, using Jackson’s new title for the first time.</p>
<p>Other than reciting her pledges, Jackson did not speak during the ceremony.</p>
<p>Roberts said that Jackson’s daughters, Leila and Talia, were present in the audience.</p>
<p>At<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-emotional-ketanji-brown-jackson-says-weve-made-it-all-us" target="_blank"> a White House event in April</a> celebrating her<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-confirms-ketanji-brown-jackson-america-its-best-supreme-court" target="_blank"> Senate confirmation the previous day</a>, Jackson did address the historic nature of her confirmation.</p>
<p>“It has taken 232 years and 115 prior appointments for a Black woman to be selected to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States,” she said. “But we’ve made it. We’ve made it, all of us.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Rocky confirmation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>President Joe Biden vowed on the campaign trail in 2020 that he would nominate a Black woman to serve on the nation’s highest court and did so by selecting Jackson two months after Breyer announced his retirement.</p>
<p>Jackson’s addition will not change the ideological balance of the court, whose 6-3 conservative majority has riled Democrats with<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-curbs-federal-power-regulate-greenhouse-gases-blow-biden" target="_blank"> consequential rulings</a> on<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-overturns-right-abortion-landmark-decision-16" target="_blank"> major</a><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-expands-gun-rights-striking-down-new-york-concealed-carry-law%C2%A0" target="_blank"> cases</a> in recent weeks.</p>
<p>But a faction of Republican senators — led by Missouri’s Josh Hawley and Texas’ Ted Cruz — still pursued an aggressive campaign against her confirmation, showing how partisan high court selections have become.</p>
<p>Over two days of questioning, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gop-senators-attack-interrupt-final-day-questioning-supreme-court-nominee" target="_blank">grilled Jackson</a> over her sentencing record in child pornography cases, defense of terrorism suspects and views of culture war<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-defends-her-record-under-grilling-us-senate-republicans" target="_blank"> issues like critical race theory</a> and the definition of a woman.</p>
<p>Democrats and other supporters, including police associations, said the attacks were unfair and praised Jackson as highly qualified.</p>
<p>Following a grueling week of confirmation hearings, the U.S. Senate <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-confirms-ketanji-brown-jackson-america-its-best-supreme-court" target="_blank">confirmed Jackson</a> in a 53-47 vote  in April. Three Republicans — Maine’s Susan Collins, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski and Utah’s Mitt Romney — joined all Democrats in voting for her.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Florida background</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In addition to being the first Black woman on the court, Jackson on Thursday became the court’s first former public defender and its first person from Florida. Born in Washington, D.C., Jackson grew up in Miami.</p>
<p>Jackson, 51, graduated from Harvard University in 1992 and Harvard Law School cum laude in 1996. She later clerked for a federal trial court in Massachusetts, a federal appeals court covering northeastern states and for Breyer.</p>
<p>She worked in private practice before joining the U.S. Sentencing Commission in 2003 and becoming a federal public defender in 2005.</p>
<p>She began her judicial career as a U.S. district judge in Washington, D.C., in 2007. Biden nominated her to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year. The Senate confirmed her for that position in a 53-44 vote.</p>

(Free Lance-Star)</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday the Environmental Protection Agency lacks authority to broadly regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants, siding with a group of Republican attorneys general and coal companies in a major blow to the executive branch’s power to curb climate change.</p>
<p>The opinion was a victory for the Republican-led states that undertook the challenge, West Virginia and 18 others — including Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska and Ohio — and curbs President Joe Biden’s ability to pursue his climate goals.</p>
<p>In the 6-3 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdf" target="_blank">decision</a>, the court’s conservatives ruled that Congress only empowered the EPA to narrowly regulate the emissions of individual power plants, and the EPA could not require a sweeping industry-wide shift from coal and gas power to renewable sources.</p>
<p>A 2015 Obama administration rule — which never went into effect — exceeded the agency’s authority, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority.</p>
<p>The agency used a little-known provision of the Clean Air Act known as Section 111 to “discover” the power to broadly regulate coal- and gas-fired power plants, Roberts wrote.</p>
<p>“The agency’s discovery allowed it to adopt a regulatory program that Congress had conspicuously and repeatedly declined to enact itself,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Kagan, liberals dissent</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a dissent written by Justice Elena Kagan, the court’s three liberals said the decision strips the executive branch agency charged with environmental regulation of its power to respond to the most urgent environmental issue the world faces. Executive branch agencies can use broad authorizing language to address significant issues, the liberals said.</p>
<p>The majority’s decision rested on the sole claim that the EPA requiring a shift from coal and gas power to renewable sources of energy was too large a policy change to be authorized by general language in the law, Kagan wrote.</p>
<p>“But that is wrong,” she wrote. “A key reason Congress makes broad delegations like Section 111 is so an agency can respond, appropriately and commensurately, to new and big problems.”</p>
<p>Congress delegates the power to expert agencies to address issues as they arise, which is what Congress did in the broad provision of the Clean Air Act the EPA used to establish the Clean Power Plan, she said.</p>
<p>“The majority today overrides that legislative choice,” the dissent reads. “In so doing, it deprives EPA of the power needed — and the power granted — to curb the emission of greenhouse gases.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden pledges action </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a statement, Biden slammed the decision and said he directed his legal team to work with the Justice Department and other agencies to find other ways to reduce climate change.</p>
<p>The ruling was “another devastating decision that aims to take our country backwards,” he said.</p>
<p>“​​I will take action,” Biden said. “My administration will continue using lawful executive authority, including the EPA’s legally-upheld authorities, to keep our air clean, protect public health, and tackle the climate crisis.”</p>
<p>The administration will work with states and local governments and pursue congressional action to move toward clean energy, he added.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A shot across the bow’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>But the ruling threatens Biden’s goal, codified in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/08/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-catalyzing-americas-clean-energy-economy-through-federal-sustainability/#:~:text=By%20transforming%20how%20the%20federal,free%20electricity%20sector%20by%202035." target="_blank">an executive order</a> in December 2021, to reach a zero-carbon electricity sector by 2035, Emily Schilling, a lawyer who heads Holland &amp; Hart’s environmental resources practice group and represented power producers who challenged the rule, said Thursday.</p>
<p>“This rule is a big part of Biden’s drive towards clean energy by 2035,” Schilling said. “Now they are going to get substantially fewer reductions from this type of rulemaking than they had planned.”</p>
<p>The EPA can still regulate greenhouse gas emissions after the ruling, but only by setting standards that are realistic for specific producers to meet without shifting how they generate power — not by mandating an industry-wide shift in generation, Schilling said.</p>
<p>The court majority ruled Thursday that requiring a shift in generation violates the major questions doctrine, a legal theory at the center of the case that Congress must clearly authorize an executive agency to decide an issue of major national political or economic significance.</p>
<p>The court’s finding has major implications across the executive branch, particularly for climate-related action.</p>
<p>“It does hamstring the whole administration in terms of the toolbox that it might have by broadly interpreting various federal statutes that give it authority to address climate change,” Schilling said in an interview.</p>
<p>“This is a bit of a shot across the bow,” she said. The court indicated it would see any effort to aggressively address climate change as beyond an agency’s purview “unless there is a very specific authorization” from Congress.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State power intact</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While the decision guts federal authority to require a shift in power sources, state leaders with the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 21 Democratic and three Republican governors, said they would continue to pursue aggressive emissions standards.</p>
<p>“Thankfully, state authority to curb greenhouse gas emissions has not changed,” co-chairs Gavin Newsom of California, Kathy Hochul of New York and Jay Inslee of Washington, all Democrats, said in a statement.<b> </b>“Today, we reaffirm our commitment to decarbonizing the power sector using our authority at the state level. We will continue moving forward with bold climate action in the states to protect the health and pocketbooks of the American people.”</p>
<p>Clarence Anthony, the leader of the National League of Cities, and U.S. Conference of Mayors head Tom Cochran issued a joint statement calling the decision “a major step back” for local efforts to address climate change.</p>
<p>“Local leaders are on the front lines of battling the climate crisis — but we can’t do it alone,” Anthony and Cochran said. “Many cities, towns and villages will continue to work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but today’s decision leaves us working uphill against this threat.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Landmark court term for conservatives</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The decision, issued on the last day of the court’s term, capped a landmark term for its new conservative majority that issued major rulings <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-overturns-right-abortion-landmark-decision-16" target="_blank">revoking a constitutional right to abortion</a>, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-expands-gun-rights-striking-down-new-york-concealed-carry-law%C2%A0" target="_blank">limiting states’ power to regulate guns</a> and <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/01/13/supreme-court-blocks-biden-workplace-vaccine-rule-allows-health-care-workers-mandate/" target="_blank">restricting federal COVID-19 regulations</a>.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer blasted the EPA ruling as part of an “extremist” run of decisions that have hurt the court’s standing with the public.</p>
<p>“This MAGA, regressive, extremist Supreme Court is intent on setting America back decades, if not centuries,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said in a written statement. “The Republican-appointed majority of the MAGA Court is pushing the country back to a time when robber barons and corporate elites have complete power and average citizens have no say.”</p>
<p>Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was as instrumental as anyone in establishing the court’s 6-3 conservative advantage, praised the decision for returning policymaking power to Congress.</p>
<p>​​The ruling “pushes back against the overbearing administrative state, which Democrats have expanded dramatically in recent years,” McConnell, of Kentucky, said in a statement. “The Constitution states clearly that the lawmaking process lies with the people and their elected representatives, not with opaque federal agencies. I am glad the Supreme Court affirmed this fact and hope other overeager bureaucrats take notice.”</p>
<p>Other leaders in Congress commented on the ruling’s policy impacts, with Republicans largely in favor and Democrats opposed.</p>
<p>“The Supreme Court’s decision today rightfully reins in unreasonable and unlawful attempts to shut down American power plants and energy production,” Wyoming’s John Barrasso, the No. 3 Senate Republican and ranking member of the Senate Energy Committee, said. “For years, Democrats have used overreaching Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations to side-step Congress and the American people to enact their extreme climate agenda.”</p>
<p>House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone called the ruling “an alarming display of hubris.”</p>
<p>“No one is safer or freer for this decision,” the New Jersey Democrat said. “All the court has achieved today is putting Americans in the crosshairs of dangerous air pollution and a growing climate crisis which threatens us all.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A years-long fight</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The suit goes back to 2015, when West Virginia and others challenged the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, a rule that established emission guidelines for states to limit carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.</p>
<p>The EPA under President Donald Trump rescinded the rule in 2019 and replaced it with the less stringent Affordable Clean Energy rule. A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., struck that rule down last year, saying the EPA was required to at least consider more aggressive alternatives.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 Democratic members of Congress<a href="https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/d/5/d5c14e70-bc2b-4e8b-b2cb-1486c747891e/E99CC718DEBEA1D1E959A52B9450090B.9f1f06279d9d6962cede638342c59c9a.2022.01.21-brief-of-amici-curiae.pdf" target="_blank"> submitted a brief</a> in the case that said the Clean Air Act clearly did give the EPA broad power to regulate emissions.</p>

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)</p><p>Donald Trump had to be held back from joining his enraged, rioting supporters — even after the president was told they were armed — in their assault on the U.S. Capitol, according to astonishing testimony to the Jan. 6 committee Tuesday from a former top White House aide.</p>
<p>Trump, spewing expletives, was so angry at being told he had to return to the White House that he tried to grab the steering wheel of the presidential limousine away from his driver, the aide said, relating what she was told by the White House deputy chief of staff for operations.</p>
<p>Cassidy Hutchinson, a key staffer for White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows at the time of the attack and the sole live witness Tuesday, revealed eye-popping details about the conduct of Trump, Meadows and other White House officials on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>She also told of an earlier incident in which Trump was so furious with Attorney General Bill Barr that, Hutchinson was told, Trump threw his lunch at the wall — she asked what had happened when she saw “ketchup dripping down the wall” in the Oval Office dining room.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">At the Ellipse</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Hutchinson was with Trump and a handful of staffers and family members offstage before the president’s speech at the White House Ellipse on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>She told the committee Tuesday she overheard Trump complaining about the crowd looking too small on TV due to the presence of magnetometers, known as “mags” for short, screening attendees for weapons.</p>
<p>“I don’t effing care that they have weapons,” Trump said, according to Hutchinson, speaking of his supporters. “They’re not here to hurt me. Take the effing mags away. Let my people in. They can march to the Capitol from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite pleading from staffers in the White House Counsel’s Office, Trump wanted to join his backers at the Capitol and told them during the speech he would be with them.</p>
<p>White House Counsel Pat Cipollone told Hutchinson to keep Trump from the Capitol, saying, “We’re going to be charged with every crime imaginable” if Trump made the trip.</p>
<p>Ahead of the speech, Cipollone’s office and White House Senior Advisor Eric Herschmann advised Trump speechwriters to be careful with the Ellipse address, Hutchinson said.</p>
<p>Hutchinson testified that Herschmann told her he’d advised Trump it would be foolish to have lines the president wanted in the speech, including different versions of “fight for Trump,” a promise he’d be at the Capitol and an implication Vice President Mike Pence could have a role in overturning the election.</p>
<p>“Mr. Herschmann and [the] White House Counsel&#8217;s Office were urging the speechwriters to not include that language for legal concerns,” Hutchinson said. “And also for the optics of what it could portray the president wanting to do that day.”</p>
<p>But Trump included all that language in his speech anyway.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump grabs for steering wheel</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>After his speech, Trump still demanded to be taken to the Capitol, Hutchinson said.</p>
<p>Shortly after Trump and his entourage returned to the White House, Deputy White House Chief of Staff for Operations Tony Ornato called Hutchinson into his office, where Bobby Engel, the head of Trump’s security detail, was sitting, Hutchinson said.</p>
<p>Ornato told Hutchinson that when Trump got into the presidential limousine after the speech, the president was under the impression — based on what Meadows had told Trump immediately before he took the stage — that he could still go to the Capitol.</p>
<p>When Engel told Trump that the Capitol had not been secured for a presidential visit and that they were going back to the White House, Trump was irate.</p>
<p>“The president had a very strong, very angry response to that,” Hutchinson said. “Tony described him as being irate. The president said something to the effect of, ‘I’m the effing president. Take me up to the Capitol now.’”</p>
<p>When Engel denied him again, Trump reached for the steering wheel, but Engel restrained him, Hutchinson said.</p>
<p>Engel did not correct or disagree with any part of Ornato’s account to Hutchinson, she said Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ketchup on the wall</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Hutchinson also described an earlier tantrum Trump threw in the White House.</p>
<p>Around the time the Associated Press published <a href="https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d" target="_blank">an article</a> quoting from an interview with then-Attorney General Barr in which the Justice Department head said the department had found no evidence of widespread fraud in the presidential election, Hutchinson heard noise from the Oval Office dining room.</p>
<p>Trump then called Meadows into the dining room. When that meeting ended a few minutes later, Hutchinson went into the room, where she saw an employee cleaning up.</p>
<p>“I first noticed that there was ketchup dripping down the wall and there was a shattered porcelain plate on the floor,” Hutchinson said. “The valet had articulated that the president was extremely angry at the attorney general’s AP interview and had thrown his lunch against the wall.”</p>
<p>Barr later met with Trump over the interview and off-handedly offered his resignation, he said in a taped deposition.</p>
<p>Trump pounded the table and said, “Accepted,” Barr recounted in the deposition.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No urgency</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Later, as Hutchinson saw rioters approach and eventually breach the Capitol on television, she became increasingly alarmed at the lack of urgency from Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman, and Trump.</p>
<p>Meadows had been alone in his office for most of the afternoon when Hutchinson entered just after 2 p.m., where she saw him seated on the couch, scrolling on his phone, she said.</p>
<p>Hutchinson asked if Meadows had seen the television coverage of the rioters approaching the Capitol and if he had talked to Trump, she said in a taped deposition played Tuesday.</p>
<p>Without looking up from his phone, Meadows brushed off his aide, saying that Trump wanted “to be alone right now,” Hutchinson said.</p>
<p>“I remember thinking in that moment, ‘Mark needs to snap out of this and I don’t know how to snap him out of this but he needs to care,’” Hutchinson said.</p>
<p>Minutes later, after rioters got inside the Capitol, she saw Cipollone “barreling down the hallway” to Meadows’ office and rushing in, leaving the door open to the anteroom where Hutchinson worked.</p>
<p>Cipollone urged Meadows to get Trump to intervene, Hutchinson said.</p>
<p>“Mark looked up at him and said, ‘He doesn’t want to do anything, Pat,’” she said.</p>
<p>Cipollone responded that “something needs to be done or people are going to die and the blood’s going to be on your effing hands,” Hutchinson said.</p>
<p>That got Meadows to accompany Cipollone to see Trump, who was a few paces away, she said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Mike deserves it’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>After the meeting, Hutchinson overheard another conversation between Meadows and Cipollone.</p>
<p>The White House counsel was urging Meadows to do more, noting that the rioters were chanting their desire to hang Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
<p>“You heard him, Pat. He thinks Mike deserves it,” Meadows told Cipollone, apparently referring to Trump, according to Hutchinson. “He doesn&#8217;t think they&#8217;re doing anything wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than quell the riot, Trump inflamed it, tweeting at 2:24 p.m. that “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done.”</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pence-was-within-40-feet-mob-inflamed-trump-jan-6-committee-reveals" target="_blank">had pressured Pence</a> for days to use his ceremonial position certifying the election results to reject legitimate results. Pence viewed that plan as outside the vice president’s legal authority and wrong morally and refused to participate.</p>
<p>“President Trump’s view that the rioters were not doing anything wrong and that ‘Mike deserved it’ helps us to understand why the president did not ask the rioters to leave the Capitol for multiple hours,” committee vice chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said.</p>
<p>A future hearing “in the weeks ahead” will detail Trump’s inaction as his supporters besieged the Capitol, Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said.</p>
<p>Trump disputed much of Hutchinson’s testimony Tuesday on Truth Social, the social media platform he founded after being removed from Twitter in the days following Jan. 6. Trump denied that he said that Pence deserved to be hanged, the comments on magnetometers, grabbing the steering wheel and throwing his lunch.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The pardons</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Hutchinson’s testimony and other information presented Tuesday reinforced the message the committee has sent throughout its series of hearings about how Trump gravitated to the most extreme advisers in his orbit who were pushing to overturn the election.</p>
<p>Asked in a taped deposition played at Tuesday’s hearing if he believed in the peaceful transition of power in the United States, former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, whom Trump had already pardoned for his role in another controversy involving the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</p>
<p>Trump resisted advice from White House lawyers and other advisers to make a speech on Jan. 7 condemning the riot, Hutchinson said.</p>
<p>Hutchinson drafted a speech that called for prosecuting rioters and calling them violent, lines that didn’t make it into the final speech.</p>
<p>Trump did ultimately deliver a speech on Jan. 7 in which he ad-libbed very little, Cheney said, noting that was unusual for the former president. In the Jan. 7 address, his only change to the written version was to skip a line that “this election is now over,” Cheney said.</p>
<p>As the speech was being drafted, Trump advocated for language about pardoning rioters, Hutchinson said, adding Meadows encouraged the inclusion of such a line.</p>
<p>Hutchinson — who <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/just-say-election-was-corrupt-trump-pressure-justice-department-detailed" target="_blank">previously testified</a> that at least five Republican House members sought Jan. 6-related pardons — said Tuesday that Meadows and Trump outside lawyer Rudy Giuliani also wanted Trump to pardon them.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Trump does read transcripts’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In the closing minutes of the hearing, Cheney said some witnesses the committee has interviewed behind closed doors have told the panel that people close to Trump have pressured them not to be truthful.</p>
<p>“What they said to me is, as long as I continue to be a team player, they know I&#8217;m on the right team, I&#8217;m doing the right thing, I&#8217;m protecting who I need to protect, you know, I&#8217;ll continue to stay in good graces in Trump world,” one witness said, according to Cheney.</p>
<p>“And they reminded me a couple of times that Trump does read transcripts and just keep that in mind as I proceed through my interviews with the committee.”</p>

Jackson Women's Health, a case about a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks, on Dec. 1, 2021 in Washington, DC. With the addition of conservative justices to the court by former President Donald Trump, experts believe this could be the most important abortion case in decades and could undermine or overturn Roe v. Wade. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra pledged Tuesday to work to preserve abortion access in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s “despicable” decision overturning Roe v. Wade — though the department’s specific actions will depend on how states seeking to limit abortion access proceed.</p>
<p>Becerra said HHS would enforce federal laws to ensure federally approved abortion pills — which must be obtained by prescription — remain available, and that those accepting federal funds provide abortion services in circumstances laid out under federal policy.</p>
<p>He did not rule out other actions the department may pursue, including providing abortions on federal lands in Republican-led states that ban or greatly limit abortions, or filing suits challenging state laws that ban access to medication abortion.</p>
<p>“We will absolutely protect Americans’ rights to care under federal law,” he said. “What exactly that translates into depends on what a state tries to do …  It’s tough to answer some of these questions more precisely until we know what the states are doing.”</p>
<p>Becerra, in response to a question about when more concrete steps might be announced by the Biden administration, said that officials want to be sure any actions are within the confines of the law.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re not interested in going rogue and doing things just because,” he said. “We want to make sure what we tell Americans is accurate, because we know Americans are hearing a lot of inaccurate information. And so to every American who’s impacted, my apologies that … we can’t tell you there’s a silver bullet.”</p>
<p>Approved abortion pills are key, though, he said.</p>
<p>“Medication abortion has been approved by the FDA for years, and it&#8217;s safe for patients,” said Becerra, referring to the U&gt;S. Food and Drug Administration. “It is the gold standard for care when someone who&#8217;s pregnant experiences a miscarriage, which is all too real for many expectant mothers across the country.”</p>
<p>Becerra said HHS will work with the attorney general and the Department of Justice to ensure that states don’t ban medication abortion based on a disagreement with the FDA over the drugs’ safety and efficacy. “And we will issue guidance to providers to ensure they receive accurate and robust information on medication abortion,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion bans in place</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A number of state abortion laws have already taken effect since the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health on Friday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-overturns-right-abortion-landmark-decision-16" target="_blank">removed a federal guarantee</a> of a right to abortion care, granting states policymaking power over access.</p>
<p>Abortion bans with limited exceptions have gone into effect in nine states, <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2022/abortion-after-roe-new-comprehensive-map-tracks-abortion-policies-and-statistics" target="_blank">according to the Guttmacher Institute</a>, a reproductive health policy organization.</p>
<p>Missouri, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas banned abortion at any point in a pregnancy, with limited exceptions. Ohio and South Carolina disallowed the procedure at six weeks, before many pregnancies are detected. Restrictions in additional states are expected in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>In Virginia, current law gives women largely unrestricted access to abortion in the first and second trimesters, with abortion in the third trimester allowed only when three doctors decide continuing the pregnancy poses a severe threat to the mother. However, Gov. Glenn Youngkin has said <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/24/youngkin-vows-to-protect-life-as-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion/" target="_blank">Virginia Republicans intend to draft legislation that could potentially ban most abortions after 15 weeks</a>, and one state senator has announced his plans to introduce a <a href="https://www.southwesttimes.com/news/hackworth-patron-life-conception-bill" target="_blank">&#8220;life at conception&#8221; law</a>.</p>
<p>Foreshadowed months ago by a draft leaked to Politico, the Supreme Court decision was not a surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friday’s Supreme Court decision was despicable, but it was not unpredictable,” Becerra said Tuesday. “HHS has been preparing for this for some time.”</p>
<p>He offered few specifics about how the department planned to act but did not rule out any path available under federal law.</p>
<p>“There is no magic bullet,” he said. “But if there is something we can do, we will find it and we will do it at HHS. Indeed, that was the instruction I received from the president of the United States.”</p>
<p>Becerra also directed HHS’ Office of Civil Rights to protect the privacy of patients seeking reproductive care and ensure such patients and their doctors are not discriminated against, he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New website</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Becerra announced the launch of a website Tuesday, <a href="https://reproductiverights.gov/" target="_blank">reproductiverights.gov</a>, aimed at educating people about reproductive health care access and resources.</p>
<p>The department will also work to ensure states are in compliance with federal law that requires medical providers that receive federal funds to offer abortion care in cases of rape, incest or when the mother’s health is at risk.</p>
<p>Beyond those efforts, Becerra said several times Tuesday that “every option is on the table.”</p>
<p>Asked specifically about a proposal from some liberals in Congress to allow abortion services on federal lands in states where the practice is restricted, Becerra did not dismiss it.</p>
<p>“We are aware of a number of ideas and proposals,” he said. “We have made no decisions yet, and we certainly would have conversations with the president to make sure we implement his directives to us.”</p>
<p>Asked about other ideas, such as providing transportation for women who live in states that ban abortion to another state, Becerra said, “Once we tell you exactly what we believe we are able to do, have the money to do, we will let you know, but until then, what I can simply say to you is every option is on the table.”</p>

Wade. (Kate Masters/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Most of the Democrats in the U.S. Senate have signed on to a letter to President Joe Biden pressing him to “take immediate action” to protect abortion rights, following the U.S. Supreme Court’s Friday ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Dobbs%20Decision%20Biden%20Letter_FINAL1.pdf" target="_blank"> one-page letter</a>, led by Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray of Washington and signed by 37 other Democrats, called the decision “an unprecedented assault on women” and pushed Biden “to use the full force of the federal government to protect abortion access in the United States.”</p>
<p>“Now is the time for bold action to protect the right to an abortion,” the senators wrote. “You have the power to fight back and lead a national response to this devastating decision, so we call on you to take every step available to your administration, across federal agencies, to help women access abortions and other reproductive health care, and to protect those who will face the harshest burdens from this devastating and extreme decision.”</p>
<p>Senators who signed the letter include Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, as well as Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Jackie Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith of Minnesota, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The letter is dated Saturday, one day after<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/voters-have-final-word-protecting-abortion-rights-biden-says" target="_blank"> Biden said</a> he would do everything in his power to protect access to abortion — but that his power as chief executive was limited and that it was up to Congress to codify protections that had existed for 49 years under the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision.</p>
<p>The current Congress, in which Democrats have a slim House majority and the Senate is split 50-50, has appeared unwilling to pass a federal law to protect abortion rights, Biden said, adding that voters should elect candidates to Congress who back abortion rights.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/24/u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">The decision by the court </a>will allow each state to set its own abortion laws, leading to a patchwork of access throughout the country. The result is expected to be an uptick in the number of women traveling out of state for abortions, as well as unsafe abortions in states where the medical procedure will now be banned or heavily restricted. Across the United States, <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2022/06/24/around-the-u-s-leaders-react-mobilize-in-states-in-wake-of-supreme-court-decision/" target="_blank">reaction has been swift. </a></p>
<p>Biden, who on Monday was at the G7 Summit in Schloss Elmau, Germany, is expected to return to the United States later this week, following a NATO summit in Madrid, Spain.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate campaigns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a sign of how Democrats plan to highlight the issue in the fall midterm elections, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the caucus’ campaign arm, revealed <a href="https://www.goponabortion.com/" target="_blank">a new website</a> Monday dedicated to highlighting Republican candidates’ abortion records.</p>
<p>The group produced a video showing a dozen Republican candidates for U.S. Senate seats saying they opposed Roe, and in some cases abortion rights categorically.</p>
<p>Herschel Walker in Georgia, for example, indicated he supported total abortion bans without exceptions. J.D. Vance in Ohio told an interviewer he opposed allowing abortions in cases of rape or incest.</p>
<p>The video included audio of Vance being asked if a woman should be forced to carry a child resulting from rape or incest.</p>
<p>“It’s not whether a woman should be forced to bring a child to term,” Vance told the interviewer. “It’s whether a child should be allowed to live, even though the circumstances of that child’s birth are somehow inconvenient.”</p>
<p>His <a href="https://jdvance.com/issues/" target="_blank">campaign website</a> describes him as “100 percent pro-life” and calls for “eliminating abortion.” Vance does support an exception if the life of the pregnant person is at risk, the <a class="c-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/10/us/politics/democrats-abortion-schumer-vote.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/10/us/politics/democrats-abortion-schumer-vote.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">New York Times reported</a> in May.</p>
<p>The DSCC also circulated a fact sheet quoting Senate candidates opposed to abortion rights in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)</p><p>President Joe Biden on Friday called for Congress to pass laws protecting abortion rights and for voters to elect pro-rights candidates on “a sad day for the country” after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling on abortion.</p>
<p>Biden pledged to fight for policies that protect abortion access, including interstate travel and access to federally approved medications. But he said he has limited power to restore the broad protections in place under the 1973 Supreme Court ruling in Roe v. Wade that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-overturns-right-abortion-landmark-decision-22" target="_blank">the court overturned Friday</a>.</p>
<p>Biden called on Congress and voters across the country to exercise their own will.</p>
<p>“This decision must not be the final word,” he said. “My administration will use all of its appropriate lawful powers, but Congress must act. With your vote, you can act. You can have the final word. This is not over.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;Roe is on the ballot&#8217;</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The decision Friday marked the first time the court repealed an existing right, and it imperiled those who need access to the procedure, Biden said in a roughly 10-minute speech at the White House.</p>
<p>“With Roe gone, let&#8217;s be very clear: The health and life of women in this nation are now at risk,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden urged voters to remember the decision in this fall’s elections, noting that the current Congress appears unwilling to approve abortion rights laws, though <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-roiled-us-supreme-court-decision-revoking-abortion-rights" target="_blank">several Democrats said Friday</a> they would renew their efforts at federal protections.</p>
<p>“This fall, Roe is on the ballot,” Biden said.</p>
<p>The ruling does not block patients from crossing state lines to seek an abortion or doctors from treating patients from other states. Biden pledged to use the executive branch “to defend that bedrock right.”</p>
<p>“If any state or local official, high or low, tries to interfere with a woman’s exercising her basic right to travel, I will do everything in my power to fight that deeply un-American attack.”</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Access to medication</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The administration will also seek to maintain access to medications and contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Some state leaders have said they will try to restrict access to medications like mifepristone, a drug the FDA approved in 2000 to end an early pregnancy and is commonly prescribed for miscarriages, Biden said.</p>
<p>Biden directed the Health and Human Services Department to protect access to medications, he said.</p>
<p>The decision’s consequences would start immediately, he said, due to several states’ so-called trigger laws to severely restrict abortion, explicitly written to take effect once Roe was overturned.</p>
<p>The ruling allows “extremist governors and state legislators” to enact abortion restrictions without exception and to criminalize abortion care, Biden said.</p>
<p>The court’s conservative majority showed “how extreme it is, how far removed it is from the majority of this country,” Biden said.</p>
<p>He highlighted a concurring opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas that also threatened court rulings protecting contraception access and same-sex marriage.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;Peaceful, peaceful, peaceful&#8217;</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With the ruling coming weeks after a man with a gun was arrested outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s house (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/08/us/brett-kavanaugh-threat-arrest.html" target="_blank">he told federal investigators</a> he intended to kill the justice but decided to surrender instead) and as the U.S. House examines the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol inspired by his predecessor, Biden urged voters unhappy with the ruling to “keep all protests peaceful. Peaceful, peaceful, peaceful.”</p>
<p>Biden closed the speech with an appeal to voters.</p>
<p>“It’s a sad day for the country, in my view, but it doesn’t mean the fight’s over,” he said. “Let me be very clear and unambiguous: The only way we can secure a woman’s right to choose, the balance that existed, is for Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade as federal law. No executive action from the White House can do that.</p>
<p>“And if Congress, as it appears, lacks the votes to do that now, voters need to make their voices heard. This fall, we must elect more senators and representatives who will codify a woman’s right to choose into federal law once again, elect more state leaders to protect this right at the local level.”</p>
<p>Biden would have more to say about the decision “in the weeks to come,” he said.</p>

</p><p>Republicans in Congress were jubilant at the U.S. Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-overturns-right-abortion-landmark-decision" target="_blank">ruling</a> overturning decades of precedent to revoke a constitutional right to an abortion, while Democrats were equally despondent about what they called an extremist decision that revoked a long-held right and represented an attack on women’s autonomy.</p>
<p>The party-line reaction hints at how lawmakers will approach abortion as the issue moves away from the court and more directly to the elected branches of government.</p>
<p>Democrats urged that voters remember the ruling when they go to the polls in the November mid-term elections and said they will redouble their attempts to pass legislation protecting the right to an abortion that’s stalled in the evenly divided U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who backs abortion rights, said she voted to confirm Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, and their agreement with the majority 6-3 decision was “inconsistent” with what they said during their hearings and in conversations with her. “The court “abandoned a fifty-year precedent at a time that the country is desperate for stability,” Collins said in a statement.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/MarkWarner/status/1540339187827843072?s=20&#038;t=hRL0hcZpQpDbTXWML2UfHg</p>
<p>The leaders of the House Pro-Choice Caucus, Democrats Diana DeGette of Colorado and Barbara Lee of California, said in a statement the ruling would force women in half the states to “face a terrifying legal landscape when trying to access the abortion care they need.”</p>
<p>“We cannot overstate the devastating impact that this horrific decision will have on millions of people across this country,” they said. “By disregarding fifty years of legal precedent, the U.S. Supreme Court has effectively stripped away from 36 million women the freedom to control their own bodies and have handed that power, instead, to the politicians in their states.”</p>
<p>The decision would “undoubtedly put the health and economic futures of millions of women at risk,” they said. They pledged to renew efforts to enshrine legal protections to abortion in legislation.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden said the ruling broke new ground for the court in revoking an existing right and would have immediate impact in states with more restrictive laws than Roe would have permitted.</p>
<p>“The court has done what it has never done before: Expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">McConnell compares to segregation decision</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Celebrating the ruling, Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell compared it to the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision that invalidated legal school segregation. Like the Friday ruling, the Brown decision also overturned a previous Supreme Court case.</p>
<p>“The Court has corrected a terrible legal and moral error, like when Brown v. Board overruled Plessy v. Ferguson,” McConnell said in a statement.</p>
<p>Statements from some Republican lawmakers recognized the ruling as the culmination of decades of activism aimed at overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling.</p>
<p>“Millions of Americans have spent half a century praying, marching, and working toward today’s historic victories for the rule of law and for innocent life,” McConnell said. “I have been proud to stand with them throughout our long journey and I share their joy today.”</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Campbell, told anti-abortion demonstrators outside the court Friday that they would &#8220;remember this day for the rest of your lives,&#8221; adding that &#8220;the worst Supreme Court decision in the history of the court has finally after nearly 50 years been overturned.&#8221; Good told the activists that he would continue to push for the Life at Conception Act, which would &#8220;implement equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States for the right to life of each born and preborn human person.&#8221; Good, along with Virginia Congressmen Ben Cline and Rob Wittman, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1011/cosponsors?q=%7B%22cosponsor-state%22%3A%22Virginia%22%7D" target="_blank">are cosponsors</a>.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepBobGood/status/1540337444347936770?s=20&#038;t=hRL0hcZpQpDbTXWML2UfHg</p>
<p>Several Republican members of Congress tweeted simply, “Life wins.”</p>
<p>Members  posting that message or a version of it included Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Jim Jordan and Mike Carey of Ohio, Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Jody Hice and Buddy Carter of Georgia, Yvette Herrell of New Mexico, Diana Harshbarger of Tennessee, Kat Cammack of Florida, Lisa McClain of Michigan and the House Republican Conference account.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden is scheduled to speak about the decision Friday afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Women in Congress </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The leaders of the Democratic Women’s Caucus in the House, including Co-Chairs Lois Frankel of Florida, Brenda Lawrence of Michigan, Jackie Speier of California and Whip Nikema Williams of Georgia, said the ruling would “go down in history as one of (the court’s) worst, most unjust decisions.”</p>
<p>“Women are not chattel, and the government should not have the right to mandate pregnancies,” they said in a statement. “Every situation and pregnancy is different, and all people deserve the freedom to control their bodies and make personal decisions about their lives and futures. We will never give up the fight for access to full health care.”</p>
<p>In her own tweet, Williams noted her decade-long employment with Planned Parenthood before coming to Congress that gave her a closer look at the consequences of restricting abortion access.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve seen the pain and devastation that comes when states eliminate equal access to legal, safe abortions,” she said. “The Supreme Court&#8217;s radical majority hasn&#8217;t just opened the door to that, it&#8217;s welcoming it with open arms.”</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Schumer blames Senate GOP</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Several Democrats blamed Senate Republicans for the Supreme Court’s conservative makeup and called for action in the chamber to protect abortion rights on the federal level.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement the ruling made Friday “one of the darkest days our country has ever seen” and called Senate Republicans “complicit in today’s decision and all of its consequences for women and families.”</p>
<p>Schumer urged voters to remember the court’s decision in November.</p>
<p>“Today’s decision makes crystal clear the contrast as we approach the November elections,” the New York Democrat said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Elect more MAGA Republicans if you want nationwide abortion bans, the jailing of women and doctors and no exemptions for rape or incest. Or, elect more pro-choice Democrats to save Roe and protect a woman’s right to make their own decisions about their body, not politicians.”’</p>
<p>Biden also called for Congress to act and for voters to choose candidates in November who support abortion rights.</p>
<p>Senate Judiciary ranking Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa celebrated the ruling, which he said protected “the rights of the unborn.” The ruling was well-reasoned in its overturning of judicial precedent — an action the high court has taken before, he noted.</p>
<p>“For many Americans, including myself, this decision is about far more than correcting a flawed legal analysis in Roe,” he said in a written statement. “It means that the rights of the unborn are no longer in jeopardy by our federal government. Our nation was founded on the fundamental principle we are endowed by our creator with the unalienable right to life — a right that must be protected.</p>
<p>“This ruling does not ban the practice of abortion but instead empowers the people, through their accountable elected representatives to make commonsense policy decisions. It takes policymaking out of the hands of unelected judges.”</p>
<p>Former Vice President Mike Pence, a longtime champion of the religious right, called for state abortion bans in every state.</p>
<p>“Having been given this second chance for Life, we must not rest and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the land,” he posted on Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Manchin, Collins blast Trump justices</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>But the court’s move Friday to directly contradict established precedent — especially by justices who’d explicitly identified Roe as settled during their confirmation hearings — opened it to criticism.</p>
<p>Even the most conservative member of Schumer’s caucus, West Virginia’s Joe Manchin III, said Friday he was “deeply disappointed” in the ruling.</p>
<p>Manchin, who considers himself pro-life and voted for two of former President Donald Trump’s nominees to the court, criticized those justices Friday for breaking with what they’d said in confirmation hearings.</p>
<p>“I trusted Justice (Neil) Gorsuch and Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh when they testified under oath that they also believed Roe v. Wade was settled legal precedent and I am alarmed they chose to reject the stability the ruling has provided for two generations of Americans,” Manchin said in a written statement.</p>
<p>Collins expressed displeasure with Gorsuch and Kavanaugh in a statement that slammed the decision for casting abortion policy into upheaval.</p>
<p>“This ill-considered action will further divide the country at a moment when, more than ever in modern times, we need the Court to show both consistency and restraint. Throwing out a precedent overnight that the country has relied upon for half a century is not conservative. It is a sudden and radical jolt to the country that will lead to political chaos, anger, and a further loss of confidence in our government.</p>
<p>“This decision is inconsistent with what Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said in their testimony and their meetings with me, where they both were insistent on the importance of supporting long-standing precedents that the country has relied upon.”</p>
<p>Manchin and fellow “pro-life Democrat” Sen. Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania blasted the decision for overturning established law.</p>
<p>“Today’s decision upends almost a half century of legal precedent and rips away a constitutional right that generations of women have known their entire lives,” Casey, whose father, as the commonwealth’s governor, challenged Roe in another of the cases the court overturned Friday, tweeted.</p>
<p>“This dangerous ruling won’t end abortions in this country, but it will put women’s lives at risk,” he added.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/timkaine/status/1540354234306203649?s=20&#038;t=hRL0hcZpQpDbTXWML2UfHg</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate fight to come?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>With abortion rights no longer guaranteed by the judicial branch, many Democrats on Friday appealed for passage of legislation to protect abortion rights, including a House-passed measure that has stalled under the Senate’s 60-vote threshold.</p>
<p>Collins’ statement promoted her own bill with Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski that she said would codify the protections in Roe. She was also working with Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine on a bipartisan bill, she said.</p>
<p>Abortion rights should be consistent nationally, Collins said, though states should be allowed to make minor policy adjustments.</p>
<p>​​“Our goal with this legislation is to do what the Court should have done — provide the consistency in our abortion laws that Americans have relied upon for 50 years,” she said.</p>
<p>Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, promised the panel would hold a hearing next month to explore the “grim reality” of the decision’s consequences.</p>
<p>“I will keep fighting to enshrine into law a woman’s right to make her own reproductive choices,” Durbin said. “We cannot let our children inherit a nation that is less free and more dangerous than the one their parents grew up in.”</p>
<p>Durbin spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris about the ruling as the two traveled on Air Force Two Friday morning, according to a pool report.</p>

</p><p>President Donald Trump sought to use the U.S. Justice Department to create the illusion of a legitimate investigation into the validity of the 2020 election results, the Jan. 6 committee and former Justice Department leaders said Thursday in the panel’s fifth hearing this month.</p>
<p>In the weeks between Election Day 2020 and Jan. 6, 2021, the date of the attack on the U.S. Capitol, the former president implored Justice Department officials to “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and Republican congressmen,” according to former acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue.</p>
<p>Several Republican House members appeared willing to play the role Trump proposed for them, publicly endorsing the president’s unfounded claims of a stolen election and privately strategizing about how to overturn the result.</p>
<p>At least five, including Andy Biggs of Arizona, Matt Gaetz of Florida and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, would later seek pardons for their roles in the scheme to overturn the election, a former aide to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said in a revelation at the end of the U.S. House panel hearing. Perry, who had been identified as a pardon-seeker at an earlier hearing, has denied he asked for a pardon.</p>
<p>The panel presented evidence that Trump mounted an intense pressure campaign against top officials at the Justice Department in late December 2020 and early January 2021, seeking to have them launch a public investigation into nonexistent voter fraud in key swing states.</p>
<p>Failing to get DOJ officials to act, Trump threatened a major shakeup to install an environmental lawyer with no criminal experience at the top of the department, solely to advance his claims of voter fraud.</p>
<p>Trump decided against that move at the last minute as it became clear it would not be effective.</p>
<p>“It was a brazen attempt to use the U.S. Justice Department to advance the president’s personal political agenda,” Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said in an opening statement.</p>
<p>Trump wanted the department to act because it would give legitimacy to his claims that the election was stolen from him, the panel said.</p>
<p>In a Dec. 27 call with acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Donoghue, Trump was not interested in the actual results of a DOJ investigation, Donoghue said.</p>
<p>Rosen told Trump the department could not change the outcome of an election.</p>
<p>“He responded very quickly,” Donoghue said. “And he said, essentially, ‘That’s not what I’m asking you to do. What I’m asking you to do is to say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.’”</p>
<p>The panel showed handwritten notes of Donoghue’s from the call that quoted Trump saying the same thing.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Georgia letter</h4>

	
<p>Trump’s Justice Department meddling centered on a draft letter acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark wrote that was to be sent to legislative leaders in Georgia, said committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican.</p>
<p>Other letters were prepared for other states, she added, though she did not name them.</p>
<p>The letter claimed that a federal DOJ investigation found significant fraud, possibly sufficient to reverse Trump’s loss in the state. The letter urged state lawmakers to convene and approve a slate of fake electors who would then cast their votes for Trump instead of the actual winner of the state, Joe Biden.</p>
<p>“Had this letter been released on official Department of Justice letterhead, it would have falsely informed all Americans, including those who might be inclined to come to Washington on January 6, that President Trump&#8217;s election fraud allegations were likely very real,” Cheney said.</p>
<p>Clark wrote the letter with three signature lines: for himself, acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Donoghue. Rosen and Donoghue refused to sign the letter, and it was never sent. They both also appeared before the committee Thursday to detail the pressure Trump and allies put on the department to create the illusion of wrongdoing in the election.</p>
<p>In a taped deposition with the committee, Clark invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 125 times, committee member Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Installing Clark</h4>

	
<p>In a “heated” Jan. 3 Oval Office meeting with Rosen, Donoghue, Clark, Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, Trump floated the idea of replacing Rosen with Clark because of Rosen’s unwillingness to legitimize his fraud claims.</p>
<p>Rosen had taken over from Attorney General Bill Barr, who investigated Trump’s fraud claims but found nothing substantive and argued with Trump about the claims’ validity. Barr resigned Dec. 23.</p>
<p>Clark had been angling for the job since around that time. He visited the White House with Pennsylvania’s Perry on Dec. 22.</p>
<p>Perry later told a local TV news station that Trump had asked him to introduce Clark to him. Clark is from Philadelphia, the Philadelphia Inquirer <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/scott-perry-trump-georgia-election-results-20210125.html" target="_blank">has reported</a>.</p>
<p>The panel also showed texts from Perry, the leader of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, to Meadows, who held the same role as  a House member from North Carolina before taking the White House job. In the texts, Perry appeared to advocate for elevating Clark within the department.</p>
<p>Clark’s sole qualification was that he would take orders from Trump to work to overturn the election, Kinzinger said.</p>
<p>“President Trump didn&#8217;t take no for an answer,” Kinzinger said. “He didn&#8217;t accept it from Attorney General Barr, and he wouldn&#8217;t accept it from Mr. Rosen, either. So he looked for another attorney general, his third in two weeks. He needed to find someone who was willing to ignore the facts.”</p>
<p>In the Oval Office meeting, Donoghue argued that Clark, an environmental attorney who had never tried a criminal case or led a criminal investigation, was not competent to hold the position. Clark objected, saying he had handled complex environmental litigation.</p>
<p>“And I said, ‘That&#8217;s right, you’re an environmental lawyer. How about you go back to your office, and we&#8217;ll call you when there&#8217;s an oil spill,’” Donoghue testified he said in the Oval Office meeting.</p>
<p>Cipollone also argued against sending the Georgia letter, calling it “a murder-suicide pact” because it would “damage everyone who touches it,” Donoghue testified.</p>
<p>Donoghue and Engel both threatened to quit if Trump replaced Rosen with Clark. They said other assistant attorneys general would as well and Clark would have no help leading the department.</p>
<p>In addition to what they said was improper ethically about the Justice Department taking orders from the president’s campaign, Clark lacked the credibility and experience to effectively lead the department, Donoghue argued. Clark could not close an effective fraud investigation in the three days before the election would be certified, Donoghue said.</p>
<p>Trump then decided against the plan, Donoghue said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pardons bombshell</h4>

	
<p>Near the close of the hearing, the panel played parts of a taped deposition of Cassidy Hutchinson, who was an aide to Meadows. Hutchinson said GOP members of Congress reached out to the White House chief of staff seeking pardons related to planning to overturn the election.</p>
<p>Hutchinson named Biggs, Gaetz, Perry, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Louie Gohmert of Texas as having sought pardons directly from Meadows.</p>
<p>In a written statement, Perry flatly denied Hutchinson’s account.</p>
<p>“I stand by my statement that I never sought a Presidential pardon for myself or other Members of Congress,” he said. “At no time did I speak with Miss Hutchinson, a White House scheduler, nor any White House staff about a pardon for myself or any other Member of Congress — this never happened.”</p>
<p>The panel also produced a Jan. 11 email from Brooks to the White House asking that all members who voted against certifying Biden’s election victory be pardoned. Brooks said that Trump asked him to send the email and that it was “also pursuant to a request from Matt Gaetz.”</p>
<p>Eric Herschmann, a Trump White House attorney, said in a taped deposition that Gaetz sought an extremely broad pardon “for any and all things.”</p>
<p>Gaetz had been seeking a pardon since early December, Hutchinson said, adding she didn’t know why.</p>
<p>John McEntee, the former White House director for presidential pardons, said in a taped deposition that Gaetz told him he had sought a pardon.</p>
<p>Gaetz and Brooks both pushed for “a blanket pardon” for members involved in a Dec. 21 meeting, and “a handful of other members,” Hutchinson said.</p>
<p>Asked if the accounts of Gaetz seeking a pardon were true, a spokesman sent a tweet from Gaetz criticizing the committee but not addressing the pardon question.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, inquired with Meadows’ office about the blanket pardon, Hutchinson said.</p>
<p>A tweet from the House Judiciary Republicans’ account, which Jordan leads, said Hutchinson’s testimony that Jordan “talked about congressional pardons, but he never asked me for one” was “100% fake news.”</p>
<p>Asked if U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green sought a pardon, Hutchinson said she had “heard” that the Georgia Republican sought a pardon from the White House counsel’s office, but didn’t contact Hutchinson about it.</p>
<p>“Saying ‘I heard’ means you don’t know,” Green tweeted following the hearing. “Spreading gossip and lies is exactly what the January 6th Witch Hunt Committee is all about.”</p>
<p>A spokesman for Biggs did not immediately return a message seeking comment.</p>
<p>The committee has not made any official statement about its upcoming schedule, but Thursday’s hearing was expected to be the last until after the July 4 holiday.</p>
<p>Future hearings, “in coming weeks,” will focus on Trump’s direction of violence toward the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of the presidential election, Thompson said Thursday.</p>

</p><p>Former President Donald Trump was directly involved in efforts to pressure state officials in Georgia, Arizona and elsewhere to overturn the 2020 election results in their states, according to evidence the U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack presented Tuesday at the panel’s fourth hearing this month.</p>
<p>Trump and his attorneys knew that several claims of fraud were untrue but pushed them anyway as part of a pressure campaign on state elections officials to change the results of the election that also included members of Congress, the committee said.</p>
<p>“Pressuring public servants to violate their oaths was a fundamental part of the playbook,” said committee chairman Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat. “A handful of election officials in several key states stood between Donald Trump and the upending of American democracy.”</p>
<p>Trump and his lawyers called and met in person with lawmakers in crucial states including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“Trump had a direct and personal role in this effort,” the panel’s vice chair, Wyoming Republican Liz Cheney, said.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin were also involved, the committee said.</p>
<p>The committee showed a text exchange between Johnson&#8217;s chief of staff, Sean Riley, and Chris Hodgson, an aide to then-Vice President Mike Pence. In it, Riley said Johnson needed to hand Pence an “alternate slate of electors” for Michigan and Wisconsin because the national archivist didn’t receive them.</p>
<p>“Do not give that to him,” Hodgson responded.</p>
<p>Alexa Henning, a spokeswoman for Johnson, tweeted on Tuesday that Johnson had no knowledge of the exchange.</p>
<p>“The senator had no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office,” she wrote. “This was a staff to staff exchange. His new Chief of Staff contacted the Vice President’s office. &#8230; There was no further action taken.”</p>
<p>Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, a Republican, testified Tuesday that Biggs phoned him on the morning of Jan. 6, asking him to sign onto a letter asking Congress to decertify the state’s electors. The Arizona speaker said he declined that request.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Biggs did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump, attorneys personally pressured officials</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Three Republican officials — Bowers, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the chief operating officer in Raffensperger’s office, Gabriel Sterling — related their experiences with Trump’s pressure campaign.</p>
<p>Trump and his attorney, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, called Bowers after the election, claiming a host of election fraud issues, including votes being cast by dead people and immigrants without legal authorization to be in the country.</p>
<p>Bowers asked repeatedly for evidence of the claims, but the campaign was unable to provide any, he said.</p>
<p>Still, Trump and Giuliani asked Bowers to hold a committee hearing to investigate fraud and Bowers refused, he said Tuesday.</p>
<p>“And I didn&#8217;t want to have that in the House,” Bowers said. “I did not feel that the evidence &#8230; merited a hearing and I didn&#8217;t want to be used as a pawn.”</p>
<p>Trump lawyer John Eastman also called Jan. 4, asking Bowers to hold a vote to decertify the election results. Bowers said that would have violated his oath of office.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re asking me to do something that&#8217;s never been done in the history of the United States,” Bowers said he told Eastman. “And I&#8217;m going to put my state through that without sufficient proof? … That I would put us through that, my state that I swore to uphold, both in Constitution and in law? No, sir.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Debunked claims in Georgia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The panel played clips from the well-documented Jan. 2, 2021 phone call between Trump and Raffensperger when Trump asked the Georgia secretary of state to “find” nearly 12,000 ballots to reverse his loss in the state.</p>
<p>In the 67-minute call, Trump floated a discredited theory that 18,000 votes for Joe Biden had been <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/brief/former-georgia-prosecutor-denies-black-suitcase-voting-fraud-at-atlantas-state-farm-arena/" target="_blank">stashed in suitcases</a> and illegally scanned.</p>
<p>At the time of the call, Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-spread-claims-election-fraud-debunked-his-own-legal-team-jan-6-panel-says" target="_blank">had been told</a> by U.S. Justice Department officials that theory was false. After BJay Pak, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2021/10/08/georgia-u-s-attorney-quit-after-trump-pressure-to-reject-election-results-new-report-confirms/" target="_blank">left office</a> amid ongoing friction with Trump over the case, the president’s hand-picked replacement, Bobby Christine, also could not substantiate the claim, Raffensperger said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Raffensperger also debunked claims Trump made that thousands of ballots for dead people were counted, that mysterious votes were dropped off in the middle of the night and that large numbers of votes by underage people, felons or unregistered people were counted, he said Tuesday.</p>
<p>On the call, Trump asked Raffensperger to change the vote totals and to call it a “recalculation.”</p>
<p>When committee member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who led most of Tuesday’s questioning, asked if he could have lawfully done that, Raffensperger answered no.</p>
<p>“The numbers were the numbers,” Raffensperger said. “And we could not recalculate because we&#8217;ve made sure that we had checked every single allegation.”</p>
<p>Raffensperger’s office completed 300 investigations related to the 2020 presidential election, he said.</p>
<p>Trump can be heard on the call implying Raffensperger could face criminal charges.</p>
<p>In another tactic, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows sought to win favors from election officials by sending them Trump memorabilia, Schiff said. After Trump pressured Frances Watson, the chief investigator in the Georgia secretary of state’s office, to do “whatever you can do,” Meadows proposed following up by sending commemorative coins and signed “Make America Great Again” hats to investigators working with Watson, Schiff said, citing text messages from Meadows.</p>
<p>Raffensperger chief operating officer Sterling publicly implored Trump to accept the election results at the time, saying that his continued pressure would lead to violence.</p>

David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler on Tuesday for not publicly condemning threats of violence after a technician working in Gwinnett County received death threats. (Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder)</p></figure>
<p>On Tuesday, Sterling said he was inspired by a voting machine contractor who had received a threat on social media from Trump supporters.</p>
<p>The office had been “steeped” in similar threats, Sterling said, but that one in particular moved him to say something.</p>
<p>“I could not tell you why that particular one was the one that put me over the edge,” he said Tuesday. “But it did.”</p>
<p>“He did not condemn them,” Cheney said of Trump. “He made no effort to stop them. He went forward with his fake allegations anyway.”</p>
<p>The fake allegations inspired Trump’s supporters to engage in intimidation and violence culminating in the attack on Jan. 6, Cheney said.</p>
<p>The committee played video of Trump supporters protesting at state legislatures and in front of officials’ homes.</p>
<p>“The punishment for treason is death,” one said.</p>
<p>Those events were “a dangerous precursor to the violence we saw on January 6,” Schiff said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Worker harassment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>After the officials testified, the committee heard from Wandrea “Shaye” Moss, a former election worker in Fulton County, Georgia.</p>
<p>Giuliani publicized a video of Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, counting votes in Atlanta. He and Trump said the video showed the pair involved in voter fraud, which was not true. Giuliani also mentioned Moss and Freeman by name at a December 2020 U.S. Senate hearing.</p>
<p>In the following months, Trump supporters harassed the two women, making threats and on one occasion breaking into Moss’s grandmother’s home to make a “citizen’s arrest.”</p>
<p>Freeman said the FBI told her she had to leave her home for safety. She stayed away from her home for two months to escape the danger, she told the panel in a taped deposition.</p>
<p>“It was horrible,” she said.</p>
<p>Moss, who is Black, also testified that she had loved her job and been proud of her work in elections because of the significance voting rights held for people in her family and others who had not always enjoyed that right.</p>
<p>Moss quit her job, she told the panel. In fact, every full-time worker in the video Giuliani publicized had since left the office, she said.</p>
<p>“It turned my life upside down,” Moss said Tuesday.</p>

Dave Brat, R-7th, at Richmond International Airport in 2018. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The private and public conflict between Donald Trump and Mike Pence over certifying the 2020 election results put the vice president within steps of the Jan. 6 attackers, the U.S. House committee investigating the insurrection said Thursday.</p>
<p>As the mob approached the U.S. Senate chamber in the Capitol, the vice president’s Secret Service retinue hustled him into a secure location. Pence’s and the rioters’ paths were within 40 feet of each other, said U.S. Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat, who led much of the committee questioning in the panel’s third public hearing.</p>
<p>Then-President Trump put Pence in danger by pressing him to execute a plan championed by John Eastman, an outside Trump attorney, to reject slates of electors from seven states that Trump lost: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Pence viewed that plan as illegal and wrong and consistently told Trump as much, people close to Pence told the House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, Attack on the U.S. Capitol. Pence later publicly declared he was duty-bound to respect the will of voters and not single-handedly overturn the election.</p>
<p>“President Trump is wrong,” Pence said in February 2022 remarks to the conservative Federalist Society that the committee replayed Thursday.</p>
<p>“I had no right to overturn the election. The presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone. And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.”</p>
<p>Committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson said he didn’t often agree with Pence, but that he endorsed that view.</p>
<p>“He resisted the pressure,” the Mississippi Democrat said of Pence. “He knew it was illegal. He knew it was wrong. We are fortunate for Mr. Pence’s courage on Jan. 6. Our democracy came dangerously close to catastrophe. That courage put him in tremendous danger.”</p>
<p>Eastman also knew his plan was illegal, committee testimony and documents show.</p>
<p>Emails obtained by the panel included one in which Eastman implored Greg Jacob, an attorney for Pence, to have the vice president commit a “minor violation” under election law and throw out contested electors.</p>
<p>The committee also showed an email from Eastman to Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani in which Eastman asked for a presidential pardon. In a deposition where the committee sought to question him, Eastman invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination 100 times, committee member Aguilar said.</p>
<p>Eastman himself conceded in front of Trump on Jan. 4 that his plan was illegal, Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff, testified in a taped deposition.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump-Pence split</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The plan to replace legitimate electors with slates of fake electors who would support Trump gained steam in early January, driving a wedge between Trump and Pence.</p>
<p>Pence told the president several times the plan was unconstitutional and illegal.</p>
<p>“He articulated to me that no, he wouldn&#8217;t want that power bestowed upon any one person,” Short said.</p>
<p>In a late afternoon call on Jan. 5 with Trump, Pence, Short and Jacob, Eastman said that he understood Pence would not reject legitimate electors.</p>
<p>On the morning of Jan. 6, before addressing supporters on the White House Ellipse, Trump phoned Pence, who moved into a room to be alone to take the call.</p>
<p>Witnesses to Trump’s end of the call, including his daughter Ivanka Trump, characterized it as “heated.”</p>
<p>Former White House aide Nicholas Luna said Trump called Pence a “wimp.” Ivanka Trump’s former chief of staff, Julie Radford, said the first daughter told her Trump used an obscener term with a similar meaning.</p>
<p>Ivanka Trump said her father’s tone was different from what she’d “heard him take with the vice president before.”</p>
<p>The previous day, staffs of Trump and Pence argued over a statement the Trump campaign released responding to accurate reporting in The New York Times that Pence did not believe he had the legal authority to certify alternate electors.</p>
<p>The campaign statement said the president and vice president were in agreement that Pence had the power to act.</p>
<p>“We were shocked and disappointed because whoever had written and put that statement out, it was categorically untrue,” Jacob said.</p>
<p>An angry Short phoned campaign spokesman Jason Miller to complain.</p>
<p>Under questioning from the committee, Miller said he and Trump created the statement together and the final product reflected what Trump wanted it to say.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Eastman scheme</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>At the center of the rift between Trump and his loyal understudy of four years was the plan Eastman was advocating to replace electors from seven states with fake slates that would support Trump.</p>
<p>Arizona was the first state alphabetically where Eastman sought to replace the electors. The others were not named Thursday but have previously <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2022/01/31/trumps-fake-electors-heres-the-full-list/" target="_blank">been reported</a> to be Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Mere hours after the attack, just before midnight on Jan. 6, Eastman implored Jacob in writing to have Pence commit a “minor violation” of the Electoral Count Act and adjourn the Senate for 10 days to allow for state legislatures to finish investigations into untrue fraud claims.</p>
<p>Told in the following days of that email, Pence responded, “That’s rubber-room stuff,” according to Jacob.</p>
<p>“I interpreted that to mean that after having seen play out what happens when you convince people that there is a decision to be made in the Capitol legitimately about who is to be the president and the consequences of that, that he was still pushing us to do what he had been asking us to do for the previous two days,” Jacob said. “That that was certifiably crazy.”</p>
<p>Eastman’s continued efforts to overturn the election, even after the riot and after Pence certified the results, were astounding to others in the White House.</p>
<p>Eric Herschmann, a White House attorney, said Eastman called him on Jan. 7 about preserving evidence in Georgia for an appeal.</p>
<p>“Are you out of your f-ing mind?” Herschmann said he responded. “Because I only want to hear two words coming out of your mouth from now on: orderly transition.”</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump tweets, mob erects gallows</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In his speech the morning of Jan. 6, Trump invoked Pence several times. Drafts of the speech did not mention the vice president, but Trump added in lines and ad-libbed more, Aguilar said. Hearings later this month will detail that process further, he said.</p>
<p>“All Mike Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify, and we become president and you are the happiest people,” he told his supporters.</p>
<p>At 2:24 p.m., Trump tweeted a criticism of Pence for not seeking to execute the fake-elector strategy. That tweet inflamed the mob that had by then breached the Capitol.</p>
<p>The rioters, who’d erected a makeshift gallows, chanted, “Hang Mike Pence,” Aguilar said. The panel showed video of the attack that included rioters making threats against Pence.</p>
<p>A confidential informant associated with the far-right Proud Boys group — which the panel has said was among the organizers of attempts to violently overturn the election — told the FBI the group would have killed Pence at the Capitol if they were able, Aguilar said, citing an affidavit.</p>
<p>Secret Service agents tried to get Pence into a car to leave the Capitol complex, Jacob said.</p>
<p>Pence refused, saying he did not want the world “to see the vice president of the United States fleeing the United States Capitol, and he was determined that we would complete the work that we had set out to do that day,” Jacob said. “And rioters who had breached the Capitol would not have the satisfaction of disrupting the proceedings beyond the day on which they were supposed to be completed.”</p>
<p>Instead, Pence stayed in the secure location, where he monitored events of the day. The committee showed a photograph, made public for the first time, of Pence in the secure area watching a Trump video praising the rioters but telling them to leave the Capitol.</p>

</p><p>Former President Donald Trump planted the seeds for the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by continually promoting theories that he lost the 2020 election through fraud, even though top advisers and officials told him there was no evidence to support the claim, according to testimony a U.S. House committee presented Monday.</p>
<p>In its second hearing to introduce findings of its ongoing investigation, the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol argued that the first step of Trump’s multipart plan was to sow doubt about the integrity of the election — even as Trump repeatedly heard from credible sources that the claims were baseless.</p>
<p>The meritless claims of a stolen election created the basis for the Jan. 6, 2021, White House rally that morphed into a siege of the U.S. Capitol to deny the certification of President Joe Biden’s election victory.</p>
<p>“He betrayed the trust of the American people,” Chairman Bennie G. Thompson said. “He ignored the will of the voters, he lied to his supporters and the country, and he tried to remain in office after the people had voted him out.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump lost an election and knew he lost an election,” the Mississippi Democrat added. “And as a result of his loss, decided to wage an attack on our democracy.”</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Avalanche of allegations’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A series of claims of voter fraud were all debunked by government officials and the Trump campaign’s own legal team, according to Monday’s testimony.</p>
<p>Theories would flow to campaign manager Bill Stepien, who would ask his team to investigate them, Stepien said in taped testimony.</p>
<p>In one example, a claim of thousands of illegal votes in Arizona turned out to be from legitimate overseas voters, Stepien said.</p>
<p>Stepien stepped away from the campaign amid an internal division between him and adviser Rudy Giuliani, as it became clear that Trump favored Giuliani’s faction, which advocated pursuing baseless election fraud claims.</p>
<p>Dominion Voting Systems, an elections contractor that was the subject of baseless fraud claims, sued Sidney Powell, a Trump lawyer who agreed with Giuliani about pursuing fraud claims.</p>
<p>In that litigation, Powell conceded that her statements about voting machines were not statements of fact, U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the committee, said Monday.</p>
<p>“What they were proposing, I thought was nuts,” Eric Herschmann, a Trump White House lawyer, said of the Giuliani faction.</p>
<p>Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also told the panel that he counseled Trump against taking Giuliani’s advice.</p>
<p>Fraud claims were also referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, then led by Attorney General Bill Barr.</p>
<p>In taped testimony, Barr described “an avalanche of all these allegations of fraud that built up over a number of days.”</p>
<p>The early claims “were completely bogus and silly and usually based on complete misinformation,” Barr said.</p>
<p>In a late November meeting in the Oval Office, Trump pressured Barr to involve the Justice Department in the fraud investigations. Barr told the president the department would investigate specific allegations of fraud that could have swung the election, but that claims to that point were “just not meritorious.”</p>
<p>Later, Trump asked Barr specifically about ballots in Detroit, where boxes were seen transported to a vote-counting station. Barr told Trump that that was to be expected as part of the city’s process to centralize vote counting among its 600-plus precincts, Barr said.</p>
<p>Barr said he told Trump the fraud claims he was making to the public were “bullshit,” a comment also aired by the committee in its <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/jan-6-panel-says-trump-far-right-groups-responsible-insurrection" target="_blank">initial Thursday night hearing</a>.</p>
<p>“I told him that it was crazy stuff and they were wasting their time on it and it was doing great, great disservice to the country,” Barr said.</p>
<p>“He&#8217;s become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff,” Barr said he remembered thinking at the time.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Atlanta suitcase</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Barr later tasked BJay Pak, the lead federal prosecutor in Atlanta, with looking into an allegation Giuliani had made about a black suitcase that Giuliani said had been wheeled into State Farm Arena, an Atlanta venue that was a mass voting site in 2020.</p>
<p>“We found that the suitcase full of ballots, the alleged black suitcase that was being seen pulled from under the table, was actually an official lockbox where ballots were kept safe,” Pak told the panel Monday.</p>
<p>Richard Donoghue, then the acting deputy attorney general, said he told Trump the department had investigated the Georgia claim — as well as others in Nevada, Michigan and Pennsylvania — and that there was no evidence of fraud.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Election Day ‘red mirage’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to Election Day, Trump warned potential fraud would be the only way he could lose the contest and urged his supporters not to vote by mail, against the advice of Stepien and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy.</p>
<p>At the White House on Election Day, Trump declared he’d won the election and complained of “a fraud on the American public.”</p>
<p>“This happened, as far as I could tell, before there was actually any potential evidence,” Barr testified.</p>
<p>Trump seemed to base his view of fraud on the fact that more votes for Biden were counted later in the night.</p>
<p>Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who led much of Monday’s hearing, asked former Fox News political editor Chris Stirewalt, who appeared in person before the panel Monday, to explain the so-called red mirage that showed Republican gains evaporating.</p>
<p>Stirewalt said he’d worked for weeks to try and educate the public that election results would likely shift from Republican to Democrat as the hours went on. Barr at least received that message, telling the panel “everyone understood for weeks” that was how election night would likely play out.</p>
<p>The phenomenon is typical for elections in the past few decades because of Democrats’ preference for mail-in and absentee voting, which are typically counted after same-day votes, Stirewalt said. Election watchers expected it to be even more pronounced in 2020, when mail-in voting increased 50% due to the pandemic, he added.</p>
<p>“In every election — and certainly a national election — you expect to see the Republican with a lead, but it&#8217;s not really a lead,” Stirewalt said. “When you put together a jigsaw puzzle, it doesn&#8217;t matter which piece you put in first: It ends up with the same image.”</p>
<p>Elections analysts haven’t traditionally cared about that quirk, Stirewalt said.</p>
<p>“But that’s because no candidate had ever tried to avail themselves of this work in the election counting system,” he said.</p>
<p>In 2020, though, Stirewalt’s team told viewers to expect it to happen “because the Trump campaign and the president had made it clear that they were going to try to exploit this anomaly.”</p>
<p>Fox News’ decision desk, of which Stirewalt was a part, was the first major outlet to call Arizona for Biden, which changed the mood among Trump’s supporters, Stepien said.</p>
<p>The decision to call Arizona was based on precinct-by-precinct data that closely aligned with pre-election polling that showed Biden leading in the state, Stirewalt said.</p>
<p>In the days after the election as states continued to count votes, Stepien felt “very, very, very bleak” about the Trump campaign’s chances, which he told Trump were 5 to 10%.</p>

(Alex Kent/ For the Tennessee Lookout)</p></figure>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Connection to riot</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump’s complaints of electoral conspiracy led to increasingly disturbing threats of violence, according to Al Schmidt, at the time a Republican member of the Philadelphia City Commission who publicly refuted claims of election fraud in the city.</p>
<p>Trump tweeted on Nov. 11 about Schmidt, who said he was then subjected to threats against himself and his family.</p>
<p>“After the president tweeted at me by name, calling me out the way that he did, the threats became much more specific, much more graphic,” he said.</p>
<p>The panel’s vice chair, Wyoming Republican Liz Cheney, said future hearings would detail Trump’s broader plans for Jan. 6, when rioters who believed Trump’s claims of voter fraud attacked the Capitol.</p>
<p>“The Trump campaign legal team knew there was no legitimate argument fraud, irregularities or anything to overturn the election,” Cheney said. “Yet President Trump went ahead with his plans for January 6, anyway.</p>
<p>“Many are serving criminal sentences because they believed what Donald Trump said about the election,” she said. “And they acted on it. They came to Washington, D.C., at his request. They marched on the Capitol at his request. And hundreds of them besieged and invaded the building at the heart of our constitutional republic.”</p>

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p><p>The opening U.S. House hearing in a series on the Jan. 6 attack included some eye-opening new details about the events of the day and the broader plot to halt the peaceful transfer of presidential power.</p>
<p>The nine-member investigative committee put former President Donald Trump at the center of the plot, while accusing leaders of two far-right organizations, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, with planning tactical details of the assault on the Capitol.</p>
<p>Thursday night’s hearing was comparable to an opening argument of a trial, with committee leaders Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, mostly laying out the broad outlines of their investigation and hinting they will be digging in further in future hearings.</p>
<p>Yet a few key details emerged that hadn’t been known or widely reported earlier. Here are five of them:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">U.S. Rep. Scott Perry asked for a pardon.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania Republican Scott Perry has not cooperated with the committee, despite a subpoena to appear.</p>
<p>Thursday, Cheney provided a glimpse into what the panel wanted to question him about: Trump’s scheme to replace U.S. Justice Department leaders with people willing to use the department to pursue his claims of a stolen election.</p>
<p>Perry was among a group of “multiple” Republicans in Congress who “sought presidential pardons for their roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election,” Cheney said.</p>
<p>Perry spokesman Jay Ostrich wrote in an email Friday the allegation was “a ludicrous and soulless lie.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pence pleaded with military leaders as Trump refused to intervene.</h4>

	
<p>The panel showed taped testimony from General Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who said Vice President Mike Pence had “two or three” calls with military leaders on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Pence, who was at the Capitol to certify the 2020 electoral college results and was a target for Trump loyalists who believed he could undo the election results by refusing to certify them, was “very animated, very direct, very firm” to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, Milley said.</p>
<p>“Get the military down here, get the [National] Guard down here,” Milley said Pence ordered. “Put down this situation, etc.”</p>
<p>Trump, meanwhile, was not in touch with Milley, Miller, the Justice Department or anyone else in the federal government about putting an end to the attack as he watched it unfold on a White House TV, Cheney said.</p>
<p>“He placed no call to any element of the U.S. government to instruct that the Capitol be defended,” Cheney said.</p>
<p>To the extent the White House was concerned with military intervention, its goal was to counter the narrative that Pence was in charge, Milley said. While Trump did not contact military leaders, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows did call, Milley said.</p>
<p>“He said: ‘We have to kill the narrative that the vice president is making all the decisions,’” Milley testified of Meadows, a former Republican congressman from North Carolina. “‘We need to establish the narrative, you know, that the president is still in charge and that things are steady or stable,’ or words to that effect.”</p>
<p>Milley said he ignored Meadows’ request.</p>
<p>Told about threats to Pence specifically, Trump said his vice president “deserved it,” Cheney said.</p>
<p>Trump’s inaction came even as congressional leaders implored him to step in, Cheney said.</p>
<p>House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy phoned Trump and members of the first family during the attack, seeking the president’s intervention, Cheney said.</p>
<p>“You will hear that leaders on Capitol Hill begged the president for help, including Republican Leader McCarthy, who was ‘scared,’” Cheney said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for McCarthy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The panel will examine Trump&#8217;s interference with state officials, and the creation of &#8220;fake electors.&#8221;</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The fifth hearing in the series, which has not been officially scheduled but is expected later this month, will focus on Trump and his allies’ pressure on state lawmakers and election officials, Cheney said.</p>
<p>The panel will provide new details of Trump’s calls to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whom Trump told to “find” nearly 12,000 votes to swing the state to him.</p>
<p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and Politico reported Thursday that Raffensperger is scheduled to testify at a hearing this month.</p>
<p>The panel will also describe efforts by Trump loyalists to produce slates of illegitimate electors in several states Joe Biden won in the 2020 election and replace them with electors who would cast their votes for Trump.</p>
<p>Slates of false electors have been linked to the competitive states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Top Trump administration and campaign officials knew Trump lost the election.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The panel presented taped testimony from former Attorney General Bill Barr, who said he told Trump the president’s claim of electoral fraud was “complete nonsense.” Barr expressed that sentiment to the president several times in a variety of words.</p>
<p>Trump’s daughter Ivanka testified she found Barr’s analysis credible and believed her father lost.</p>
<p>Campaign spokesman Jason Miller testified that the leader of the campaign’s data team, Matt Oczkowski, bluntly told Trump he was going to lose the election.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s call for his supporters to come to Washington was a catalyst.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Despite many of his closest advisers telling him he lost, Trump continued to pursue avenues to stay in power, including by bringing his most committed supporters to Washington the day Congress was to ratify the election results.</p>
<p>The first hearing closed with a montage of people involved in the attack saying that they came because the president told them to do so. Trump tweeted in December 2020 to invite supporters to rally on Jan. 6, saying it would be “wild.”</p>
<p>The people who took up that call include members of the Oath Keepers and other extremists, who interpreted the tweet as a call to arms, Marcus Childress, investigative counsel for the committee, testified.</p>
<p>“The President called us to the Capitol,” the president of the Oath Keepers Florida chapter posted on social media, Childress said. “He wants us to make it wild.”</p>
<p>The Oath Keepers were then among the most organized participants in the attack, setting up “quick reaction forces” near Washington’s Virginia suburbs.</p>

The bipartisan committee, which has been gathering evidence related to the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol for almost a year, will present its findings in a series of televised hearings.

<p>Over roughly two hours before a prime-time television audience, leaders of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol focused on the role of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. Both are far-right groups with histories of violence and violent rhetoric that supported Trump.</p>
<p>The top two members on the panel, Chairman Bennie G. Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, also zeroed in on Trump and congressional Republicans, some of whom — including Pennsylvania’s Scott Perry — later asked for presidential pardons for their roles in the attack, Cheney said.</p>
<p>Representatives for Perry did not return an email seeking comment Thursday night.</p>
<p>Cheney, one of two Republicans on the nine-member committee, lost her position in House Republican leadership over her criticism of Trump.</p>
<p>“Tonight, I say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible: There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone,” Cheney said in an opening statement. “Your dishonor will remain.”</p>
<p>Thompson in his opening remarks emphasized Trump was at the center of it all, after his attempts to overturn the election results in the courts failed.</p>
<p>“But for Donald Trump, that was only the beginning of what became a sprawling, multi-step conspiracy aimed at overturning the presidential election… aimed at throwing out the votes of millions of Americans — your votes — your voice in our democracy — and replacing the will of the American people with his will to remain in power after his term ended,” said Thompson.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump was at the center of this conspiracy.</p>
<p>“And ultimately, Donald Trump — the president of the United States — spurred a mob of domestic enemies of the Constitution to march down the Capitol and subvert American democracy,” Thompson said.</p>
<p>The hearing is <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/what-know-about-thursdays-public-hearing-jan-6-attack-us-capitol" target="_blank">the first in a series throughout June,</a> as the committee lays out its evidence about the attack.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Proud Boys and Oath Keepers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Multiple members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers have been charged with seditious conspiracy for their roles in breaking into the Capitol.</p>
<p>Thursday, the panel presented details of the groups’ planning and involvement, which they said was crucial for the attack to take place.</p>
<p>“The attack on our Capitol was not a spontaneous riot,” Cheney said.</p>
<p>Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys, and Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers, met in a Washington parking garage the night before the Capitol attack, according to footage captured by documentarian Nick Quested, a hearing witness.</p>
<p>Quested also had video of Tarrio saying the two groups were “fighting the same fight.”</p>
<p>On the morning of Jan. 6, Quested said he was surprised to see Proud Boys going to the Capitol instead of Trump’s speech from the Ellipse, near the White House.</p>
<p>The committee showed video of a group of Proud Boys initiating a breach of a line of bike racks outside the Capitol on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Proud Boys were among those fighting the U.S. Capitol Police officers on the west side of the Capitol. One officer, Caroline Edwards, testified to the committee Thursday that Proud Boys Joseph Biggs and Ryan Samsel ripped barricades down.</p>
<p>Edwards was trying to hold barricades in place, a struggle during which she was knocked unconscious when she was pushed backwards and fell.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Officer Sicknick is a hero. Officer Edwards is a hero. </p>
<p>Every Capitol Police officer who defended democracy on January 6th is a hero. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/January6th?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">#January6th</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Elaine Luria (@ElaineLuria) <a href="https://twitter.com/ElaineLuria/status/1535083778124615681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">June 10, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Later, a Proud Boys member broke a window that allowed rioters to enter the Capitol, according to video the committee showed Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Rewriting history</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>On Jan. 6, Trump did not contact his Defense secretary or attorney general to call off the attack, Cheney said.</p>
<p>He became angry with aides who asked him to do something to calm the rioters, she said.</p>
<p>“Aware of the rioters’ chants to hang Mike Pence, the president responded with this sentiment: ‘Maybe our supporters have the right idea,’” Cheney said. “Mike Pence ‘deserved it.’”</p>
<p>Thompson said part of the purpose of the hearing was to remind the American people what happened on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>In the past 17 months, Trump allies, including members of Congress, have sought to “rewrite history,” Thompson said, downplaying the seriousness of the attempted coup.</p>
<p>“Tonight and over the next few weeks, we&#8217;re going to remind you of the reality of what happened that day,” he said. “But our work must do much more than just look backwards. The cause of our democracy remains in danger.”</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy criticized the committee, calling it “the most political and least legitimate committee in American history.”</p>
<p>Throughout the hearing, Republican House members blasted the committee on social media and suggested its investigation was unimportant.</p>
<p>“The partisan January 6 committee is nothing more than an illegitimate show trial,” Arizona’s Andy Biggs tweeted.</p>
<p>“Tonight’s J6 committee hearing is the most blatant attempt to distract the American people from the disastrous and failed policies of the Democratic Party,” Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican, tweeted.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Barr testimony</h4>

	
<p>The first testimony the panel presented was video footage of Bill Barr, the U.S. attorney general on Election Day 2020, who resigned the next month over a disagreement with Trump about the legitimacy of the election.</p>
<p>“I made it clear I did not agree with the idea of saying the election was stolen and putting out this stuff, which I told the president was bullshit,” Barr said in the taped testimony.</p>
<p>Barr continued, saying he told Trump “in no uncertain terms,” there was no evidence of fraud. Barr said there was “absolutely zero basis” for allegations that voting machines were used to steal the election.</p>
<p>Barr called those allegations “complete nonsense,” “crazy stuff” and said “it was doing a great, great disservice to the country.”</p>
<p>The panel also showed video of Ivanka Trump, the former president’s daughter, who said Barr’s views about the lack of fraud were convincing to her.</p>
<p>The panel’s next hearing is set for 10 a.m. Monday.</p>

(Alex Kent/ For the Tennessee Lookout)</p><p>The U.S. House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol will launch the first in a series of public hearings Thursday night in the hopes of drawing a major prime-time national television audience.</p>
<p>The Democratic-led committee, which includes two Republicans who defied their party leadership to join, has been tight-lipped about what ground its public presentation will cover.</p>
<p>Leaders have promised in general to unveil new material, introduce a summary of findings gathered over a nearly yearlong investigation and preview further hearings about the mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump who sought to overturn the 2020 election results.</p>
<p>Here are some questions and answers about the committee and its plans:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What has the investigation found?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The evidence suggests a “coordinated, multi-step effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and prevent the transfer of power,” according to a committee release Tuesday.</p>
<p>“This week, [the committee] starts sharing evidence of the chilling inside plan to overturn the 2020 election and block the constitutional transfer of power,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who sits on the panel, <a href="https://twitter.com/RepRaskin/status/1534186125656473600" target="_blank">tweeted</a> Tuesday. “America will see footage and records we have documenting the dangerous extremist assault on our constitutional order.”</p>
<p>The nine-member committee has been working toward two objectives: the public hearings and a final report. The hearings will inform the final report, but could also capture the attention of the general public, said Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University’s program on extremism who has researched the Capitol attack.</p>
<p>“The role of these hearings in the next couple of weeks is partially laying the groundwork for that report, but also telling the story to the American people,” Lewis said in an interview. “It’s the committee showing their work.”</p>
<p>The panel cannot prosecute suspects on its own, but may make criminal referrals to the U.S. Justice Department.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What will the hearings cover?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Chairman Bennie G. Thompson <a href="https://twitter.com/BennieGThompson/status/1534194917022519298" target="_blank">tweeted</a> a Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/06/january-6-committee-hearing-schedule-how-to-watch/?fbclid=IwAR39G2u3jRTK7RD4kb9w-KHlM0l6663B5N0BOvO68yPGg59I89GL0VAq7VU" target="_blank">article</a> Tuesday that reported the panel would hold as many as eight public hearings, each one with a theme.</p>
<p>The panel has conducted more than 1,000 interviews since it formed in July 2021, according to the Post article. It has subpoenaed <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2022/02/02/trumps-fake-electors-heres-the-full-list/" target="_blank">so-called fake electors </a>from seven states — Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“A lot of it is to remind the American people that there is a clear and present danger to democracy,” Lewis said.</p>
<p>The upcoming series of hearings could document some “connective tissue” between the Trump White House, outside groups and other supporters, Lewis said.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/29/is-denver-riggleman-still-a-republican-hes-not-sure/" target="_blank">Denver Riggleman</a>, a Republican former U.S. House member from Virginia who advised the committee, said in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/06/02/january-6-forensic-data-meadows-text-messages-denver-riggleman-sot-ac360-vpx.cnn" target="_blank">a recent CNN appearance</a> that text messages to and from then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, a former congressman from North Carolina, showed connections among members of the executive, legislative and judicial branches who were involved in planning to overturn the election results.</p>
<p>Meadows’ text messages provided “a roadmap” for the investigation, Riggleman said.</p>
<p>“I think Mark Meadows is the MVP for the committee,” he said. “I think they should pay him. The data that we got from there actually allowed us to really structure an effective investigation.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How can viewers watch it?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The first hearing is scheduled for 8 p.m. ET on Thursday and is supposed to last about 90 minutes. The major television networks and news channels will carry it live, except for Fox News, which plans to air its normal prime-time programming. Fox Business will broadcast the hearing live. The committee <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/news/watch-live" target="_blank">usually also livestreams </a>its meetings.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who’s on the committee?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Seven Democrats and two Republicans comprise the House Select Committee Investigating the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Chairman Thompson, D-Miss.</b>: First elected to the House in 1992, he has been the Democratic leader of the House Homeland Security Committee since 2005, including two stints as chairman.</li>
<li><b>Vice Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.:</b> The No. 3 House Republican until last year, she was ousted for voting to impeach Trump for his role in provoking the Jan. 6 attack.</li>
<li><b>Elaine Luria, D-Va.</b>: A second-term lawmaker who served two decades in the Navy, she is the vice chair of the House Armed Services Committee.</li>
<li><b>Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla.: </b>A centrist Democrat, she announced late last year she will not be running for reelection to a fourth term.</li>
<li><b>Raskin, D-Md.</b>: A former constitutional law professor, he was the lead impeachment manager for Trump’s second impeachment.</li>
<li><b>Pete Aguilar, D-Calif.: </b>The vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, he is the only member of Democratic leadership on the panel.</li>
<li><b>Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill.: </b>Like Cheney, he is a Republican critical of Trump. Both were appointed to the panel by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — not Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, whose slate of Republican members Pelosi rejected.</li>
<li><b>Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.</b>: The chair of the House Administration Committee, she is a longtime House Judiciary Committee member and served as a manager for Trump’s first impeachment trial in the Senate.</li>
<li><b>Adam Schiff, D-Calif.:</b> The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he was the leader of the investigation that resulted in the first impeachment of Trump and the lead impeachment manager.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who will testify?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The committee has announced two witnesses for Thursday night.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police Officer Caroline Edwards was the first law enforcement officer injured by rioters on Jan. 6. Edwards patrolled the West Plaza of the Capitol the day of the attack and sustained “a traumatic brain injury,” according to the panel.</p>
<p>Documentary filmmaker Nick Quested recorded “the movements around the Capitol that morning, the first moments of violence against U.S. Capitol Police, and the chaos that ensued,” according to the committee.</p>
<p>Quested also reportedly taped a Jan. 5, 2021, meeting between the leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, two violent right-wing groups with members who have been charged with seditious conspiracy related to the Capitol attack. He previously met with the Justice Department and the House committee privately, which he said he led through a detailed explanation of his footage.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s next?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The committee will hold another public hearing at 10 a.m. ET on Monday, June 13. The panel has not released information about the witnesses or content of that hearing.</p>
<p>The committee is expected to hold six to eight public hearings through June, with a final one in September.</p>
<p>McCarthy has continually questioned the panel’s legitimacy and Republicans are likely to disband the committee if they retake the House majority in this fall’s elections.</p>

<p>Proxy voting was meant to keep crowds of House members smaller and thereby limit the spread of COVID-19, back in the early days of the pandemic. The first proxy votes were cast on May 27, 2020.</p>
<p>But some members used it while running for higher office or attending political events, undermining the legitimacy of the system and potentially giving fuel to Republicans who could seek to end proxy voting if they retake the chamber in this fall’s election.</p>
<p>“That sort of threatens to ruin the practice for the folks who really need it,” said Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution.</p>
<p>Proxy voting is extended for 45 days at a time and currently has been set by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi <a href="https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/51322-0" target="_blank">to expire on June 28. </a></p>
<p>According to a database of proxy votes compiled by Cronkite News/Arizona PBS, the top 20 users of the vote-by-proxy through April 2022 were all Democrats. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Al Lawson of Florida</li>
<li>Donald Payne of New Jersey</li>
<li>Frederica Wilson of Florida</li>
<li>Bobby Rush of Illinois</li>
<li>Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona</li>
<li>Grace Napolitano of California</li>
<li>Grace Meng of New York</li>
<li>Raúl Grijalva of Arizona</li>
<li>Katie Porter of California</li>
<li>Alan Lowenthal of California</li>
<li>Mark DeSaulnier of California</li>
<li>Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas</li>
<li>Tony Cárdenas of California</li>
<li>Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey</li>
<li>Albio Sires of New Jersey</li>
<li>Lois Frankel of Florida</li>
<li>Ted Lieu of California</li>
<li>Donald McEachin of Virginia</li>
<li>Lucille Roybal-Allard of California</li>
<li>Chellie Pingree of Maine</li>
</ol>
<p>The top Republican, according to the data, was Idaho’s Russ Fulcher. With 176 votes by proxy representing less than one-quarter of his votes over the past two years, Fulcher ranked 37th overall.</p>
<p>Grijalva, the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and Johnson, the chairwoman of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, are the only committee leaders in the top 20.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Health cited</h4>

	
<p>The members who answered questions about their proxy voting habits all said they were related to health concerns, either because the members themselves or those close to them were at increased risk of poor outcomes if they contracted COVID-19:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payne spokesman Patrick Wright said: “The Congressman is a diabetic and diabetes is one of the highest ‘at-risk’ factors for catching COVID-19. He has utilized proxy voting to continue his service and work for his constituents in the 10th Congressional District while still protecting his health and safety.”</li>
<li>Frankel, through a spokeswoman, said: &#8220;I have used proxy voting as a public health precaution to minimize COVID-19 exposure for myself and others, especially my 96-year-old mother.” She added: &#8220;I used the time away from travel and in-person voting for many, many Zoom meetings with stakeholders, helping to guide them to relief through the COVID-19 crisis and a variety of other meetings we used to have in-person.&#8221;</li>
<li>McEachin spokesman Shahid Ahmed said: “Health challenges the Congressman has faced have made him more susceptible to COVID-19.” Ahmed added, “Out of an abundance of caution, he has used proxy voting, especially when we see an uptick in coronavirus cases.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Fulcher was <a href="https://lmtribune.com/opinion/fulcher-s-life-was-complicated-enough-before-cancer-struck/article_24c4e226-ec4f-5c60-9be9-df30d2b21a07.html" target="_blank">diagnosed with renal cancer</a> last year.</p>
<p>Representatives for Lawson, Wilson, Kirkpatrick, Grijalva, Watson Coleman, Sires, Pingree and Fulcher did not respond to messages.</p>
<p>In her research, Reynolds found that the two greatest predictive factors, other than party, for how often a member would vote by proxy were the distance from a member’s district to Washington and age.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans oppose proxy voting but some use it</h4>

	
<p>House Republicans opposed the concept of voting by proxy and challenged the practice in court, eventually losing in the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The numbers show Democrats are generally more likely to vote by proxy more often, and Republicans are more likely not to vote by proxy at all.</p>
<p>Of the 115 members since May 2020 who have never cast a proxy vote, 98 are Republicans. Michigan Libertarian Justin Amash also did not cast a proxy vote before he left office in January 2021.</p>
<p>But 149 House Republicans have cast at least one remote vote, meaning Republicans who have proxy voted outnumber those who have not.</p>
<p>Still, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy spearheaded the suit to block the practice and Republicans generally have sought to undo pandemic restrictions, which could mean proxy voting’s days are numbered if the GOP retakes the House majority in this fall’s elections.</p>
<p>In a statement emailed by a spokesman, Wisconsin Republican Mike Gallagher, who has never cast a vote by proxy, criticized members who used the practice — especially those whose absences were unrelated to the pandemic. Gallagher called on Republicans to halt the practice if they control the House next year.</p>
<p>“Members are lying to their constituents when they submit proxy statements saying that it is the pandemic — not space launches, political conferences, or trips on Air Force One — that keeps them from conducting their sworn duty on the House floor,” Gallagher said.</p>
<p>“It’s destroying Congress and further eroding trust in this institution,” he added. “When Republicans take back the House, they must end this charade and require all members to be present in Washington to do the work that the American people sent us here to do.”</p>
<p>More than a dozen Republicans used proxy voting to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference last year. Those members include Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Ted Budd and Madison Cawthon of North Carolina, Mark Green of Tennessee, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania and Greg Steube of Florida.</p>
<p>Democratic U.S. Reps. Charlie Crist of Florida, Kai Kahele of Hawaii and Thomas Suozzi of New York have all recorded substantial numbers of proxy votes while they run for governor of their home states.</p>
<p>Reynolds said she expected Republicans to end proxy voting if they take the majority. That change would have its positives and negatives.</p>
<p>It has been useful for members with COVID-19 or other serious health conditions to continue their jobs during the pandemic, but proxy voting can also hurt the overall health of the House by depriving members of opportunities to build relationships, Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Enabling members to vote from anywhere could encourage them not to come to Washington at all, she said.</p>
<p>“Time spent in the district is important and valuable, and it&#8217;s a real part of what members do,” she said. “But being in Washington is also part of what members do. And portraying time spent in the Capitol as unnecessary to do the job feeds this perception that the institution is a place to be avoided.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Beyer helps out colleagues</h4>

	
<p>The Cronkite database also tracked the members who cast votes on behalf of their colleagues. One member, Virginia Democrat Don Beyer, led that category by a considerable margin.</p>
<p>As of the end of April, Beyer had cast 2,209 votes on behalf of colleagues. New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone cast the second-most, with 1,683.</p>
<p>Representing a district just across the Potomac River from the District of Columbia, Beyer’s proximity is part of the reason his colleagues have so often turned to him for proxy-voting help, Beyer spokesman Aaron Fritschner said in an email.</p>
<p>As a committee chairman, of the Joint Economic Committee, and a member of both the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the moderate New Democrat Coalition, the fourth-term Democrat has developed many relationships in the House, he added.</p>
<p>“Rep. Beyer is honored that his colleagues have placed this trust in him, and it has given him some good stories to tell (for instance, casting multiple votes to impeach former President Trump),” Fritschner wrote.</p>
<p>“Rep. Beyer hopes that as our society adapts to the changing nature of the pandemic and the health situation hopefully improves, votes in the House will return to being more in-person,” Fritschner added. “He is a big believer in the in-person relationships that Members of Congress form in the process of legislating.</p>
<p>“But while conditions and rules necessitate proxy voting, Rep. Beyer will continue to help his colleagues as he has done since mid-2020.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of a U.S. Senate panel and election administrators raised a bevy of concerns Thursday about the challenges elections officials will face this fall, saying problems ranging from a lack of paper to coordinated misinformation campaigns could affect confidence in U.S. democracy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan panel of current and former elections officials and experts told the Senate Rules and Administration Committee that state officials face threats of physical violence, while dealing with misinformation, supply chain challenges and funding shortfalls — making the administration of this year’s midterm elections more difficult.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, listed those developments at the start of the hearing. She highlighted threats that have led Colorado officials to receive active shooter training and obtain bullet-proof vests, with morale among elections administrators nationwide worryingly low.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In light of these challenges, we must support the election officials working on the front lines of our democracy,” Klobuchar said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to relatively new concerns related to holding elections in a pandemic, ranking Republican Roy Blunt of Missouri noted foreign and domestic adversaries persist in targeting election infrastructure and spreading online misinformation.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Violence sparked by online sources</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damon Hewitt, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said misinformation remained an issue in administering elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online misinformation </span><a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2022/05/17/biden-condemns-racist-theory-of-white-supremacy-in-visit-to-buffalo-after-mass-shooting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inspired the racist killer of 10 Black people at a Buffalo grocery store</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last weekend, and has led to threats against elections bureaucrats, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently passed state laws limiting ballot access in the name of election security also arose from unfounded misinformation, Hewitt said. The laws, passed in many Republican-led states since the 2020 elections, lend legitimacy to theories that elections are not secure, he added, worsening the risk of violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are giving those who want to sow violence, doubt and misdirection in the election process … political camouflage for their threats and their attacks,” he said. “Put simply, these laws undermine our democracy and its promise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wesley Wilcox, the Republican supervisor of elections for Marion County, Florida, said he also had been subjected to threats, despite the state’s strong performance in the 2020 election cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Florida was touted as the gold standard and model for voting in the 2020 election,” he said. “But lately the accolades have waned and high-fives for job well done have ceased. Instead, they’ve been replaced by threats of violence against us or our families.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">There’s not even enough paper</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One new problem for this election cycle is the supply chain backlog, which has limited elections offices’ access to a basic but crucial item needed for elections: paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana Secretary of State R. Kyle Ardoin, a Republican, said his state had to contact every paper producer in North America “to ensure we will have the supplies we need.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a crisis that demands immediate attention and bipartisan action,” Ardoin said. “It is not an exaggeration to say that if this situation is not handled, it could lead to a serious erosion in the confidence of our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase in voting by mail has only heightened the need for paper supplies, Ardoin said. That was one reason to promote in-person voting, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leigh M. Chapman, the acting secretary of state for Pennsylvania appointed by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, declared Tuesday’s primary elections in the commonwealth a success, “with minimal issues.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One issue, though, a breakdown in Lancaster County’s process for counting 22,000 early-vote ballots that required those ballots to be hand-counted, reinforced a request from Chapman’s department to allow pre-canvassing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-canvassing is the process of election officials counting ballots that have come in before Election Day. While 37 states allow pre-canvassing, Pennsylvania is among those that do not, making it harder for election officials in the commonwealth to report vote totals earlier and deal with Election Day issues as they come up, Chapman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that Florida’s pre-canvassing regime allowed election watchers to call the state in the 2020 presidential election on Election Day. Major networks didn’t call the result in Pennsylvania, by contrast, until four days later. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Big Lie barely mentioned</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senators and a witness panel made up of current and former state election officials mostly avoided discussion of former President Donald Trump’s false claims about malfeasance in the 2020 election that caused his loss. The false narrative has gained prominence within the Republican Party nationwide, including among elected officials and candidates in this year’s election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not mentioning Trump or his supporters by name, Chapman said it was “especially disturbing” that some disinformation has come from those “with a sworn duty to defend our democratic process.” She was clear about the integrity of the 2020 election and the harm that lies about voter malfeasance cause to confidence in U.S. democracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The November 2020 election in Pennsylvania, like every election since, was free, fair and secure,” she said. “Allegations of illegal activity in Pennsylvania&#8217;s 2020 presidential election have been repeatedly dismissed in more than two dozen federal court cases and debunked by independent fact-checkers. Repeating this falsehood over and over harms our democracy and voters’ confidence in our elections process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senators aired familiar partisan arguments about voting accessibility and security during portions of the hearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican of Texas, said that expanding nontraditional avenues of voting, like mail-in voting, was inviting fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Democrats keep moving in the direction of election chaos,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ardoin told Cruz his office couldn’t quickly enough process absentee ballots to be sure that they were legitimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, asked Chapman if mail-in ballots had presented any problems in this week’s primary elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She answered they had not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilcox said in an opening statement his goal was to make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Padilla, a Democrat who joined the Senate after serving as the California secretary of state, told Wilcox that slogan can be used as a pretext to restrict voting rights, with too much attention paid to stopping nearly nonexistent cheating and not enough focus on making voting easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you look at data, we&#8217;ve got the harder-to-cheat part down because voter fraud in America is exceedingly rare,” he said. “What I first get frustrated by is my colleagues forget about the first part, the easier-to-vote part.”</span></p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>The two leaders of the U.S. Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, Montana Democrat Jon Tester and Kansas Republican Jerry Moran, have reached a deal with House leaders to pass a bill to extend health care access to veterans for conditions related to exposure to toxic chemicals during their service, the pair announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The consensus bill would for the first time provide service veterans of all generations health care and benefits for exposure to toxic burn pits overseas.</p>
<p>The agreement bridges the divides of two related measures passed in each chamber of Congress this year and clears the path for a bipartisan bill to become law.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday the chamber would vote on the legislation the week of June 6, while the White House announced President Joe Biden’s support.</p>
<p>The Senate unanimously approved a $1 billion Moran-Tester bill in February to ensure that post-9/11 service veterans who were exposed to toxic burn pits can receive care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>The House did not consider that legislation, instead<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202257" target="_blank"> voting</a> 256-174 in early March to approve a separate <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3967?r=1&amp;s=6" target="_blank">bill</a> that would be much larger in scope and price.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s agreement would result in a measure that more closely resembles the House bill, though it includes some substantial changes. Tester and Moran negotiated the deal with House Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Mark Takano, D-Calif., and ranking Republican Mike Bost of Illinois, as well as the Biden  administration and veteran advocacy groups.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Toxic pits of trash</h4>

	
<p>During wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, federal contractors would fill holes in the ground with garbage, medical waste, vehicles and plastics, douse the trash in jet fuel and set it on fire, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/magazine/military-burn-pits.html" target="_blank">The New York Times reported</a>. Defense officials have been reluctant to accept responsibility for the health issues that members of the military have contracted after breathing in the smoke from these burn pits. There are more than 670,000 veterans in Virginia, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, many of them from Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.</p>
<p>The bill is named after Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson, an Ohio National Guard solider who deployed to Kosovo and Iraq and died in 2020 of lung cancer believed to have resulted from exposure to burning toxic waste in Iraq more than a decade earlier.</p>
<p>“This bipartisan legislation is the most comprehensive toxic exposure package the Senate has ever delivered to veterans,” Tester and Moran said in a release.</p>
<p>“For far too long, our nation’s veterans have been living with chronic illnesses as a result of exposures during their time in uniform. Today, we’re taking necessary steps to right this wrong with our proposal that’ll provide veterans and their families with the health care and benefits they have earned and deserve.”</p>
<p>Takano also applauded the agreement.</p>
<p>“For too long, Congress and VA have been slow to act on toxic exposure — but I am elated that Chairman Tester and Ranking Member Moran have agreed to a compromise to advance my legislation that upholds our promise to toxic-exposed veterans,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Final text for the consensus bill has not been released. Once the Senate approves it, the House would then have to approve changes. The bill would then head to Biden’s desk.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Expanded eligibility</h4>

	
<p>The bill would expand VA health care eligibility to post-9/11 veterans, affecting about 3.5 million former servicemembers. It would add 23 burn pit and toxic exposure-related conditions to a list of conditions presumed to be service-related, according to the Tester-Moran statement.</p>
<p>The Senate would alter the House bill by phasing in the presumption over a span of years, addressing a fear that the VA would be overwhelmed by the provision taking effect immediately, spokespeople for the Senate committee said.</p>
<p>The Senate version will also include a framework to establish future presumptions of service-related toxic exposure, according to the release from Tester and Moran.</p>
<p>The agreement would also strengthen federal research on toxic exposure, improve the VA’s resources and training for toxic-exposed veterans and add funding for claims processing, the VA workforce and VA facilities.</p>
<p>The bill would also expand presumptions for Agent Orange exposure to several countries in Asia and islands in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a Wednesday statement Biden supports the measure.</p>
<p>“President Biden has championed legislation to deliver the benefits and health care services that veterans impacted by toxic exposures have earned,” she said in a statement. “This historic, comprehensive bill will do just that.”</p>
<p>The VA <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/04/25/nine-rare-cancers-tied-to-burn-pit-exposure-added-to-va-benefits-list/" target="_blank">added</a> nine rare respiratory cancers linked to burn pit exposure to the list of illnesses eligible for disability and health benefits last month.</p>

<p>In a visit to the Upstate New York city, Biden and other New York Democrats, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, rebuked the racist “great replacement” conspiracy theory the shooting suspect adhered to and called for federal action to restrict access to guns.</p>
<p>But before talking about gun policy or replacement theory, Biden named the victims in the Saturday rampage at Tops Friendly Markets. <a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/complete-coverage-10-killed-3-wounded-in-mass-shooting-at-buffalo-supermarket/collection_e8c7df32-d402-11ec-9ebc-e39ca6890844.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank">The Buffalo News reported</a> that 13 people were shot and all 10 victims who died were Black, in the city’s worst shooting in history.</p>
<p>They included 77-year-old Pearl Young, a grandmother and public school teacher who also ran a local food pantry, and Andre Mackneil, a restaurant worker who was buying a cake for his son’s third birthday.</p>
<p>“His son’s celebrating a birthday asking, ‘Where’s Daddy?’” Biden said.</p>
<p>Attorney General Merrick Garland <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-statement-mass-shooting-buffalo-ny" target="_blank">has said</a> the crime is being investigated as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism, with the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives working in conjunction with Buffalo police.</p>
<figure id="attachment_31794" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1397764119.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-31794" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1397764119.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1397764119.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1397764119-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/GettyImages-1397764119-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  US President Joe Biden gets a hug from a young boy whose father was killed at the Tops market shooting during an event at the Delavan Grider Community Center on May 17, 2022 in Buffalo, New York.

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A ‘poison’ in U.S. society</h4>

	
<p>After that introduction memorializing the victims, Biden focused his remarks on White supremacy, which he called “a poison … running through our body politic.”</p>
<p>He alluded to politicians and media members who exploited the so-called great replacement theory — a false view that holds White Americans are under threat of extinction by a plot to systematically replace them with non-White people.</p>
<p>The suspected Buffalo killer, 18-year-old White man Payton Gendron of Conklin, New York, reportedly posted a 180-page document filled with “great replacement” talking points before traveling to the supermarket on Buffalo’s predominately Black East Side to commit the killings. Gendron has been charged with one count of murder and will return to court on Thursday for a felony hearing, <a href="https://www2.erie.gov/da/index.php?q=press/broome-county-teen-arraigned-killing-ten-injuring-three-shooting-buffalo-grocery-store" target="_blank">officials said.</a></p>
<p>“The internet has radicalized angry, alienated, lost and isolated individuals into falsely believing that they will be ‘replaced,’” Biden said. “I and all of you reject the lie. I call on all Americans to reject the lie. And I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain and profit.”</p>
<p>Biden did not specifically name anyone who exploited that lie for their own gain. White replacement is a frequent theme on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News program and leading Republicans, including the No. 3 House Republican, Elise Stefanik of New York, have echoed its core premise.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration was choosing not to name anyone associated with the ideology, to deny them attention.</p>
<p>“The people who spread this filth know who they are, and they should be ashamed of themselves,” she told reporters en route to Buffalo. “But I&#8217;m not going to give them or [the] obnoxious ideas they&#8217;re pushing the attention that they desperately want.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Schumer writes to Fox executives</h4>

	
<p>Schumer took a different approach, writing to Fox Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch and three other Fox executives Tuesday, calling for an end to the airing of great replacement views. Carlson was carbon copied on <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/schumer_letter_to_murdoch_517.22.pdf" target="_blank">the letter</a>.</p>
<p>“This pernicious theory, which has no basis in fact, has been injected into the mainstream thanks in large part to a dangerous level of amplification by your network and its anchors,” Schumer wrote.</p>
<p>In a Tuesday afternoon <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1526623234132688896" target="_blank">tweet</a>, Schumer said Carlson had invited him on the program to “debate the letter.” Schumer declined, he said.</p>
<p>On his Monday show, Carlson distanced himself from Gendron’s writings and accused Democrats of using the tragedy against him.</p>
<p>“Because one mentally ill teenager murdered strangers, you cannot be allowed to express your political views out loud,” he said. “That is what they are telling you. That is what they wanted to tell you for a long time, but Saturday’s massacre gives them a pretext and justification.”</p>
<p>A representative for Fox News did not immediately return a message seeking comment Tuesday.</p>
<p>The letter followed a Monday floor speech Schumer gave that also called out Carlson by name and linked great replacement ideology to former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, with each passing year, it seems harder and harder to ignore that replacement theory, and other racially motivated views are increasingly coming out into the open and given purported legitimacy by some MAGA Republicans and cable news pundits,” Schumer said Monday.</p>
<p>Schumer said the shooter’s goal was to kill as many Black people as possible. Hochul noted Gendron drove three hours and chose the location specifically with that goal in mind.</p>
<p>Biden called the shooting “domestic terrorism.”</p>
<p>Biden said radicalization could not be stopped, but that the use of the internet to advance its dangerous effects possibly could be.</p>
<p>“We can&#8217;t prevent people from being radicalized to violence,” he said. “But we can address the relentless exploitation of the internet to recruit and mobilize terrorism.”</p>
<p>Biden linked the Buffalo attack to shootings at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018 and three Asian-American spas<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2022/03/16/memorials-mark-anniversary-of-spa-shootings-with-tributes-to-victims-of-hate-and-fear/" target="_blank"> in Atlanta last year</a> and to the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that he said inspired him to run for president.</p>
<p>Charlottesville rally goers chanted replacement theory slogans. Trump later said there were “very fine people on both sides&#8221; of the rally.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hate and guns a ‘lethal combination’</h4>

	
<p>Hochul blamed the shooting on a mix of hateful ideology and easy access to guns.</p>
<p>“It is that lethal combination that resulted in the loss of 10 decent, good people,” she said.</p>
<p>Gendron used a rifle with a modified magazine that she said was illegal in New York. She called for “a national gun policy,” saying that the killer <a href="https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2022/05/15/buffalo-shooting-gun-used-ar-15-suspect-payton-gendron-purchased-vintage-firearms-endicott/9786647002/" target="_blank">could have easily</a> obtained a magazine from Pennsylvania that was not permitted under New York state law.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins, a Democrat who represents Buffalo, also called for a national gun law.</p>
<p>Biden called for keeping assault weapons off the streets, saying a previous ban enacted when he was U.S. Senate Judiciary chairman led to a decrease in shootings. Congress did not renew that ban when it expired in 2004.</p>
<p>Schumer said he would work in the Senate to combat White supremacy and rid “our streets of weapons of war.”</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats have for years routinely tried to pass federal gun legislation after mass shootings, but have not been successful.</p>

(Wyatt Gordon/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>President Joe Biden’s administration will seek to hasten construction of roads, bridges, wind farms and more by tweaking the federal review process for environmental and other permits, administration officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>On a press call, administration officials said they were seeking to make permitting easier without sacrificing environmental standards.</p>
<p>The new permitting plan includes five components, White House Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory said. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consolidating decision-making among agencies to reduce the number of federal permits a project would need. The White House will also set up teams of sector-specific experts in an effort to streamline permitting applications from various industries.</li>
<li>Establishing timeline goals and tracking project information</li>
<li>Engaging in “meaningful outreach and communication” with states, tribes and local governments to gain support and input from projects’ starting points.</li>
<li>Improving technical assistance and support to nonfederal partners.</li>
<li>Using existing agency resources to prioritize permitting review.</li>
</ul>
<p>The permitting plan is meant to build on provisions in last year’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure law. That law created a permitting council to bring agencies together at the beginning of the permitting process.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1h9CpVFtc4"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/02/23/with-half-a-billion-in-new-federal-funding-will-virginia-finally-fix-its-bridge-repair-backlog/">With half a billion in new federal funding, will Virginia finally fix its bridge repair backlog?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;With half a billion in new federal funding, will Virginia finally fix its bridge repair backlog?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/02/23/with-half-a-billion-in-new-federal-funding-will-virginia-finally-fix-its-bridge-repair-backlog/embed/#?secret=m4kWM34soU#?secret=1h9CpVFtc4" data-secret="1h9CpVFtc4" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Less than 10 percent of the funding in the infrastructure law will be spent by the federal government, said Samantha Silverberg, the White House’s deputy infrastructure implementation coordinator.</p>
<p>To encourage states, tribes, cities and private companies to build quickly, the administration wants to reduce permitting delays.</p>
<p>Streamlining permitting has long been an ambition of federal officials of both parties. During the period President Donald Trump’s administration focused on infrastructure, reducing federal review times was an often stated goal.</p>
<p>Biden officials insisted Tuesday that the administration could speed up permitting without sacrificing environmental standards.</p>
<p>“This plan explicitly rejects the tired view that there&#8217;s an inherent tradeoff between permitting efficiency — doing permitting in a timely and predictable manner — with permitting effectively, ensuring the best outcomes for the community and the environment,” Jason Miller, the deputy director for management  said. “We can and we will do both.”</p>
<p>One environmental benefit of the plan will be in hastening construction of renewable energy facilities, such as the South Fork wind farm off the coast of Long Island, New York, Silverberg said.</p>
<p>Asked how environmental reviews would be shortened, officials on the call declined to offer specifics, saying only that review timelines would “make sense” and depend on the scope and type of the project.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that we create a timeline approach that makes sense given the nature of the particular action that’s being taken,” Mallory said.</p>

<p>The effort appears largely symbolic. Democrats are well short of the 60 votes needed to pass the bill and even lack the 50 votes needed to change Senate rules to lower that threshold.</p>
<p>Still, Schumer, of New York, and other Democrats said they want to put every member of the chamber on the record, following the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473" target="_blank">leak to Politico </a>earlier this week of a Supreme Court draft opinion showing justices at least initially voted to overturn the abortion rights case Roe v. Wade. The ruling is not final and could yet be changed.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re having the vote next week,” Schumer said. “We&#8217;re going to see where everyone stands … Once we have that vote, we will figure out the best way to go from there.”</p>
<p>Schumer plans to set up a vote for May 11, he said.</p>
<p>The Senate <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00065.htm" target="_blank">rejected</a> a similar bill in February. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin III joined all Republicans present to defeat a procedural vote, 46-48. A spokeswoman for Manchin did not return a request for comment Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters Thursday, a handful of Senate Democrats blasted their Republican colleagues for focusing more on the leak of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504" target="_blank">draft</a> of an opinion overturning Roe than the consequences of the opinion.</p>
<p>“Fundamentally, Republicans don’t give a rip about women,” Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii said.</p>
<p>Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said the vote would make Republicans to take a stance on the issue itself instead of the leak.</p>
<p>Republicans have for years articulated opposition to abortion rights and to the Roe decision in particular. Public opinion is firmly in favor of keeping Roe in place, with supporters of the ruling outnumbering its opponents more than 2-to-1 in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21183488-abortion?responsive=1&amp;title=1" target="_blank">a recent CNN poll</a>.</p>
<p>“Next week, they&#8217;re not going to get away with just saying, ‘Let&#8217;s look over there,’” Stabenow said. “They&#8217;re going to have to vote.”</p>
<p>Schumer pledged the vote would be only the start of action on the issue.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re starting off here, but you will hear plenty from us,” he said. “This is not just one vote and then this issue goes away.”</p>
<p>Overturning Roe would <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2022/05/02/states-rush-to-revise-their-abortion-laws-as-a-major-u-s-supreme-court-decision-nears/" target="_blank">leave states to determine</a> their own abortion policies. <a href="https://t.co/sqhy5MTdQq" target="_blank">Many would ban the practice</a>, either through recently enacted laws, those designed to take effect after Roe is overturned or decades-old laws that were never repealed while federal protections were in place.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, for example, an 1849 law banning abortion is still on the books and would go back into effect if Roe is overturned, Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin said Thursday.</p>
<p>“As I was listening to Tammy talk about Wisconsin, I thought, we always said they’d take us back to the ‘50s,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said. “They&#8217;re taking us back to the 1850s.”</p>
<p>Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington added that states with restrictive abortion regimes would suffer a “brain drain,” as qualified candidates for hiring would seek work in states with more liberal reproductive rights laws.</p>
<p>The issue could be a problem for the private sector, as well as federal agencies like NASA that has a strong presence in states like Florida and Texas that are considering or have enacted abortion restrictions, she said.</p>

The strike led to the court case Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, which was combined with others before the U. S. Supreme Court as Brown v. Board of Education. (Virginia Department of Historic Resources)</p><p>The U.S. House cleared a bill Tuesday that would expand the Kansas site honoring the U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning school segregation, adding National Park Service sites in other states to commemorate their roles in the decision as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/270" target="_blank">bill</a> would designate sites related to school desegregation cases in Virginia, Delaware, South Carolina and the District of Columbia as important parts of the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision that ended legal school segregation.</p>
<p>The House passed the bill by voice vote Tuesday, with no member raising an objection. The Senate <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/04/11/moran-marshall-laud-broadening-of-brown-v-board-education-commemorations/" target="_blank">also passed the bill</a> by voice vote April 6, meaning the House action Tuesday sends the measure to the White House for President Joe Biden’s signature.</p>
<p>Congress designated a national historic site in Topeka, Kansas, in 1992 to honor Linda Brown, the first named plaintiff in the combined Brown v. Board of Education case, and her family.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Court’s Brown ruling was the result of Brown and four other suits and there is no NPS site to recognize the other cases.</p>
<p>The site in Topeka honoring Brown “tells the story of the ordinary people who took this extraordinary action to ensure their children had equal educational opportunities,” House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat who is the highest-ranking Black member of Congress, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>“However, the other communities involved in this historic effort have no National Park Service presence acknowledging their contributions,” he added. “This bill rights that wrong.”</p>
<div>One of the cases that the court heard with Brown was Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County. The site of the all-Black Robert Russa Moton High School in Farmville, Virginia, which was the subject of the suit, will become an affiliate of the National Park Service.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The site gained national historic status in 1998 and has operated as a museum since 2001. Even with the NPS designation, the site would still be managed locally.</div>

<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<p>The bill would also add one acre of land adjacent to the current Topeka site.</p>
<p>It requires the Department of Interior to develop a management plan for each site.</p>
<p>“In recent years, the National Park Service has made a concerted effort to provide a more inclusive look at American history to ensure that our parks tell the stories of all Americans,” U.S. Rep. Cliff Bentz, an Oregon Republican who led the GOP floor debate on the bill, said. “I applaud the National Park Service for its efforts to make all Americans feel welcome and included in our national park system.”</p>
<p>Arizona Democrat Raul Grijalva, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee that oversees national parks, said the acknowledgement of all plaintiffs in the case was important.</p>
<p>“This legislative effort will continue to elevate the important stories and education of the civil rights movement,” he said.</p>
<p>The Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site would become the Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park under the legislation.</p>

<p>The announcement marked yet another setback for a presidential climate plan that was once seen as historically ambitious.</p>
<p>Biden’s signature climate bill has gone nowhere in the U.S. Senate, he’s called for more domestic fossil fuel production to combat rising gas prices and members of his own party <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/04/08/biden-goal-for-u-s-transition-to-electric-vehicles-cast-into-doubt-at-u-s-senate-hearing/" target="_blank">doubt whether he can meet goals</a> for a U.S. transition to electric vehicles.</p>
<p>After noting climate as one of four crises facing the nation during his 2020 campaign, Biden gave it only a passing mention in his State of the Union address in March.</p>
<p>The White House defense on the oil and gas leases is that a court order forced adoption of a policy contrary to Biden’s climate objectives. Accompanying the move was a raise in the royalty rates for energy companies drilling on federal land, a reform long sought by environmental advocates.</p>
<p>But it still represented a departure from the president’s campaign rhetoric that promised no more drilling on federal lands, and it was met with derision by some environmental advocates.</p>
<p>Randi Spivak, the public lands director for the Center for Biological Diversity, called it “a reckless failure of climate leadership.”</p>
<p>Other advocacy groups were more understanding — the National Wildlife Federation, for example, stressed provisions of the restart that raised rates for fossil fuel development and limited the area that would be available.</p>

<p>As the nation celebrates Earth Day on Friday, the administration has said it is still committed to climate action.</p>
<p>The evidence? Biden’s move to <a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/energy-environment/biden-calls-for-decade-of-action-on-climate-apologizes-for-trump-exit-from-paris-accord/" target="_blank">rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement,</a> funding to target carbon reduction and electric vehicles in last year’s transportation infrastructure law, and a goal set to reduce carbon emissions by 50 to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030.</p>
<p>“The press and the pundits may want to declare President Biden&#8217;s climate agenda dead,” an administration official said at a press briefing Monday. “But this week, we will show how it is very much alive and well.”</p>
<p>Thursday, the Transportation Department announced a $6.4 billion program funded by the infrastructure law to help state transportation departments limit greenhouse gases from vehicles. Biden is scheduled to address climate issues in an Earth Day speech in Seattle Friday.</p>
<p>Here are three big reasons why the White House has struggled with its climate agenda:</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Court decisions</h4>

	
<p>During the presidential campaign, Biden pledged to end new fossil fuel development on federal lands. He followed through on that promise on his first day in office, issuing an executive order to pause new oil and gas leases as the administration reviewed the program and its impact on climate change.</p>
<p>A federal judge, though, U.S. District Judge Terry Doughty in Louisiana, found the executive order was illegal and <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2021/06/16/federal-judge-halts-biden-pause-on-new-oil-and-gas-leases-across-the-u-s/" target="_blank">ordered the administration</a> to restart leasing.</p>
<p>In a tweet, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said that the order forced the new oil and gas lease sales.</p>
<p>She noted the parcels available for lease were decreased 80% from what had been nominated for leases in 2021 and touted the raise in royalty rates from 12.5% to 18.75%.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the move “was the result of a court injunction that we continue to appeal. And it&#8217;s not in line with the president&#8217;s policy.”</p>
<p>House Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and former chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2021/12/02/bidens-oil-and-gas-policy-falls-short-on-climate-goals-house-democrats-say/" target="_blank">has pushed</a> the Biden administration for more ambitious climate action, accepted that the court order forced the administration’s hand and credited Haaland with the reforms.</p>
<p>“I’m glad we finally have an administration that recognizes that the status quo for our oil and gas leasing program is a rip-off for the American people,” Chair Grijalva said.</p>
<p>But some outside groups called it a violation of Biden’s campaign pledge.</p>
<p>Kyle Tisdel, director of energy and climate at the environmental legal group Western Environmental Law Center, said in an interview the administration had options, even after the “flawed” injunction from Doughty.</p>
<p>The court order only said the administration could not issue a blanket pause on new leases, he said. But the Bureau of Land Management could still decline to issues new leases on a case-by-case basis, he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Congress</h4>

	
<p>Bipartisan members of the House and Senate passed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that the administration helped steer and Biden signed last year.</p>
<p>A group of progressive lawmakers almost sank the measure over concerns it would exacerbate — not solve — the climate crisis. The administration and congressional leaders promised to pair the infrastructure bill with a sweeping $3.5 trillion bill that would include major climate provisions.</p>
<p>The House passed the larger bill, but the Senate never took it up. West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin III came out against the legislation in December. With no Republican support, Manchin’s opposition doomed the bill in the evenly divided Senate.</p>
<p>“What the last year has shown us is that the Biden administration trying to calibrate action to the whims of certain senators or congresspeople or midterm elections has been sort of a fool&#8217;s errand,” Tisdel said.</p>
<p>Some members of Congress remain optimistic that a climate bill can be passed. Manchin has indicated an openness to supporting the clean energy tax credits in the Biden plan, but also has said that negotiations on the so-called Build Back Better plan must start from scratch.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat who <a href="https://sourcenm.com/2022/01/05/some-democrats-push-to-rescue-climate-plan-in-biden-spending-package/" target="_blank">earlier this year called for</a> passing the climate provisions of the Biden spending plan, said in a Thursday statement he remained focused on expanding clean energy, funding conservation work and supporting fish and wildlife protections.</p>
<p>“All eyes are rightly on the Biden administration and on Congress to pass transformative climate investments,” Heinrich said. “We need to deliver.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">War and spiraling gas prices</h4>

	
<p>Biden’s <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/03/01/bidens-state-of-the-union-address/" target="_blank">State of the Union address</a> this year <a href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/03/01/biden-in-state-of-the-union-urges-unmistakable-support-for-democracy-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">focused</a> on the war in Ukraine, then just days old, and spiking prices for consumer goods — including energy.</p>
<p>His top priority, he said, was “getting prices under control.”</p>
<p>The drive to cut costs seemed to displace climate action, which he only mentioned twice, once in the context of lowering energy prices.</p>
<p>To address rising prices in the short term, Biden has also called on domestic producers to pump more oil and has released millions of barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a complex of underground storage caverns in Louisiana and Texas.</p>
<p>Biden, in Iowa, also <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/04/12/biden-biofuels-have-role-in-easing-gas-prices/" target="_blank">waived a regulation</a> banning sales of the ethanol blend E15 during the summer months. The Environmental Protection Agency normally doesn’t allow sales from June to mid-September due to concerns over air pollution.</p>
<p>Julie McNamara, a deputy policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a climate advocacy group, said using rising energy prices to make the case should be an opportunity to hasten a transition away from fossil fuels to less volatile energy sources.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re seeing a push from the fossil fuel industry and their supporters to increase our dependence on fossil fuels, to increase production and fighting back against clean energy,” she said.</p>
<p>“When every indicator says now is the time to be doubling down on our commitment to this clean energy transition.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>The Biden administration will fight a court decision for the authority to mandate masks on airplanes, trains and other public transit, following a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation Wednesday night that a mandate was still needed.</p>
<p>The CDC said in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0420-masks-public-transportation.html" target="_blank">a statement</a> that the mandate keeps transportation safer for immunocompromised people and the greater public.</p>
<p>“CDC continues to recommend that people wear masks in all indoor public transportation settings,” the agency said. “As we have said before, wearing masks is most beneficial in crowded or poorly ventilated locations, such as the transportation corridor.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department filed a notice of appeal late Wednesday afternoon challenging the Monday ruling from U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle that <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-florida-throws-out-national-mask-mandate-travelers" target="_blank">struck down the mandate</a> because she found the CDC lacked the legal authority to impose it.</p>
<p>The CDC said Wednesday the mandate had been “well within” its legal authority.</p>
<p>The Justice Department said Tuesday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-administration-will-appeal-ruling-travel-mask-mandate-%E2%80%94-if-cdc-says-its-needed" target="_blank">it would appeal the decision</a> only if the CDC determined a mandate was necessary.</p>
<p>Mizelle’s ruling came just days after the CDC extended the mandate until May 3. The agency had said it needed to review public health conditions to determine if the requirement was needed after that.</p>
<p>Then-President Donald Trump appointed Mizelle to a federal judgeship in Florida and the Republican Senate <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1162/vote_116_2_00239.htm#position" target="_blank">confirmed her 49-41 </a> following the 2020 election.</p>
<p>The American Bar Association rated Mizelle, then 33, “not qualified” because she lacked the 12 years of trial experience the professional organization considered to be a minimum requirement.</p>
<p>Before Wednesday’s CDC announcement, President Joe Biden and the administration had sent mixed signals about masking on transportation. Biden told a reporter who asked if passengers should still mask up that it was “up to them.”</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Biden was answering the question “quite literally” because the mandate was not being enforced. The administration still recommended people wear masks while traveling, she said.</p>
<p>The mandate remained in effect Wednesday evening. An appeals court could issue an emergency order to resume the mandate, but the administration had yet to ask for such an order.</p>
<p>Most major airlines have made masking optional since Monday’s ruling. Local transit authorities are <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/briefs/masks-no-longer-required-on-public-transit-in-n-j-governor-says/" target="_blank">making their</a> <a href="https://sourcenm.com/2022/04/19/rail-runner-abq-buses-and-the-sunport-do-away-with-mask-mandates-for-travelers/" target="_blank">own decisions</a>.</p>

<p>The legal analysis of U<a href="https://www.flmd.uscourts.gov/judges/kathryn-kimball-mizelle" target="_blank">.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle,</a> whom then-President Donald Trump appointed in late 2020, turned on the language in a federal law authorizing the CDC to regulate sanitation.</p>
<p>But the word “sanitation” implies something is being cleaned, and masks, at best, trap infectious droplets and don’t clean anything, she wrote.</p>
<p>“The Mask Mandate is best understood not as sanitation,” she wrote. “But as an exercise of the CDC’s power to conditionally release individuals to travel despite concerns they may spread a communicable disease.”</p>
<p>That power, Mizelle said, is usually only available when it applies to individuals entering the United States from other countries or individuals traveling between states who are “reasonably believed to be infected. “ But the mask mandate applied on a much broader level.</p>
<p>The judge also found that the CDC improperly bypassed a standard requirement to accept public comments on the rule. She rejected the government’s argument that the public health emergency required quicker action.</p>
<p>Health Freedom Defense Fund, an <a href="https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/news/2021-10-22/lawyer-asks-for-dismissal-of-hailey-anti-mask-complaint-as-group-targets-another-mask-rule-in-county" target="_blank">Idaho-based</a> advocacy group that challenges COVID 19-related restrictions, and two Florida women who argued wearing masks on planes aggravated their anxiety brought the suit in July 2021.</p>
<p>The order applies nationwide. It is not yet clear if President Joe Biden’s administration will seek an appeal.</p>
<p>The administration had extended the mandate to May 3, even as other federal, state and local pandemic regulations were relaxed. It applied on commercial flights and in airports, as well as in taxis, trains and other public transportation.</p>
<p>A group of 17 congressional Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Campbell, filed <a href="https://www.sirillp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MassieVCDC-filed-unprocessed-cef22ce44a5e6dda4c198535750fa4c9.pdf" target="_blank">a suit</a> last month <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/17-republicans-congress-file-suit-end-mask-mandate-air-travel" target="_blank">challenging the mandate</a>. Monday’s order was separate from that case.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepBobGood/status/1516104764697763843?s=20&#038;t=pqMHrw1ehXzzOwkD-uGv4A</p>
<p>The mandate<a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2021/09/24/huge-uptick-in-pandemic-air-rage-hits-flight-attendants/" target="_blank"> likely contributed </a>to more disruptive behavior aboard commercial flights during the pandemic, as noncompliant passengers argued with other passengers and the flight attendants tasked with enforcing the mandate.</p>
<p>Of more than 1,100 cases of unruly passengers reported by the Federal Aviation Administration so far this year, 744 were related to masking, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/data_research/passengers_cargo/unruly_passengers/" target="_blank">according to FAA data</a>.</p>
<p>The ruling was greeted by Republicans. “Good riddance,” <a href="https://twitter.com/RepDanBishop/status/1516114280495697930" target="_blank">tweeted</a> U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop, a North Carolina Republican who was part of the House Republicans’ suit. “Americans should never again be harassed about masks on planes or any form of travel.”</p>
<p>Representatives for the White House and the CDC did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson accepted her dual roles Friday as the next U.S. Supreme Court justice and as a symbol of racial progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking outside the White House with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris looking on, and her voice at times trembling with emotion, Jackson acknowledged the historic milestone her confirmation as the first Black woman on the court represented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has taken 232 years and 115 prior appointments for a Black woman to be selected to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States,” she said. “But we&#8217;ve made it. We’ve made it, all of us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson said she’d been “flooded” with cards and notes from well-wishers, and was particularly moved by those from children “because they speak directly to the hope and promise of America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I strongly believe this is a moment in which all Americans can take great pride,” she said. “We have come a long way toward perfecting our union. In my family, it took just one generation to go from my segregation to the Supreme Court of the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson will be sworn in when Justice Stephen Breyer steps down from the court at the end of the current term.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Civil rights leaders</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson recognized civil rights icons Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the late Justice Thurgood Marshall and her “personal heroine,” Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to serve as a federal judge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They and so many others did the heavy lifting that made this day possible,” she said. “For all of the talk of this historic nomination and now confirmation, I think of them as the true path breakers. I&#8217;m just the very lucky first inheritor of the dream of liberty and justice for all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson thanked Breyer, whose seat she will be taking and for whom she worked as a law clerk, praising his “commitment to an independent, impartial judiciary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some U.S. Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, criticized Jackson for not taking a position against adding seats to the Supreme Court, as Breyer had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-defends-her-record-under-grilling-us-senate-republicans" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the confirmation process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jackson said that was a question for Congress and declined to state an opinion. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, answered similarly during her 2020 confirmation hearings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson said she would work to “uphold the rule of law at the highest level.” As she did throughout her hours of testimony during Senate confirmation hearings, she said she viewed the judicial branch as having limited power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, though, have complained that she lacked a judicial philosophy and gave too much weight to her own policy preferences when ruling from the bench.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Republicans spent virtually all of their time questioning Jackson about her sentencing in child pornography cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missouri’s Josh Hawley and others said Jackson was too lenient in such cases, though Democrats and judicial experts said her sentencing practices were mainstream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden appeared to allude to those accusations in comments he made before introducing Jackson Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew the person I nominated would be put through a painful and difficult confirmation process,” Biden said Friday. “But I have to tell you, what Judge Jackson was put through was well beyond that. It was verbal abuse, the anger, the </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gop-senators-attack-interrupt-final-day-questioning-supreme-court-nominee" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constant interruptions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the most vile, baseless assertions and accusations.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden thanked the three Republican senators — Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah — who voted to confirm Jackson.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A White House climate goal to transition the United States to electric vehicles is in trouble if the nation cannot produce more minerals that go into those vehicles’ batteries, U.S. senators of both parties said Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee agreed during a hearing that more domestic production of lithium, nickel, cobalt and other minerals would be needed to increase use of electric vehicles. President Joe Biden has </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/12/13/fact-sheet-the-biden-harris-electric-vehicle-charging-action-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set a target</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of making half of all U.S. vehicles electric by 2030.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether you agree or disagree with the president’s goals, there is no dispute that they will dramatically increase the demand for critical minerals,” ranking Republican John Barrasso of Wyoming said. “It’s clearly time for us to get serious about expanding domestic mineral production.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With transportation fuels making up the largest single source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, Chairman Joe Manchin III, a West Virginia Democrat, said adding electric vehicles would be important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Manchin, the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, and the lawmaker who </span><a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/schumer-vows-u-s-senate-action-on-voting-rights-and-social-policy-as-manchin-rift-deepens/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively killed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Biden’s </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2021/11/19/house-democrats-pass-bidens-1-85-trillion-build-back-better-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sprawling climate and social spending</span></a> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, was doubtful that the domestic critical minerals industry would be able to produce quickly enough to make good on Biden’s target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With China dominating production of minerals needed to produce batteries, Manchin said he couldn’t support mandates to increase the number of electric vehicles on the road until U.S. producers matured. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no question that we need to be doing all that we can to reduce emissions from the transportation sector,” Manchin said. “EVs certainly have a role to play in addressing those emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, with China’s dominance over the critical minerals required of the EVs, I have grave concerns about moving too quickly toward an EV-only future.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. produces about 9% of the world’s battery cells, said David Howell, a director with the U.S. Energy Department’s Vehicle Technologies Office. A June 2021 </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf?msclkid=ca15b9e3aa0611ecbb48bd90dc5582ea" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said domestic battery manufacturing is “dependent on foreign sources for battery materials and precursors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duncan Robert Wood, a vice president for strategy and new initiatives at the nonpartisan international affairs think tank Wilson Center, told the panel that absent a “Herculean” effort to get minerals out of the ground, the White House target was likely out of reach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The targets are laudable, but I’m not sure if they’re realistic,” Wood said. “When you look at just the amount of materials that are going to be needed … there just aren’t enough being produced globally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to add to electric vehicles’ share of the U.S. fleet would see opposition from Manchin as long as most of the material came from adversaries like China, which he said is responsible for 80% of the world’s battery material processing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchin said he opposed a tax rebate for electric vehicle buyers, a provision in Biden’s climate and social spending proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why would we give a $2,500 credit for something that we don’t do and we have to rely on China to do it?” Manchin said Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchin also called for environmental groups to ease off lawsuits against miners. With the president’s target only eight years away, environmental litigation can block a new mine from operating for up to 10 years, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The environmental community’s got to get on board,” he said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ukraine invasion </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Russian invasion of Ukraine gave added importance to ramping up domestic production of critical minerals, Scott Forney, the president of the energy and defense contractor General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems, told the panel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The war and subsequent Western sanctions, have caused price spikes in gas. Many congressional Democrats </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-panel-grills-oil-executives-soaring-gas-prices" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the disruption shows the need for electric vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Russia produces about 20% of the world’s battery-quality nickel, Barrasso said. And the war has also effectively shut down the nickel trade, Forney said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given ongoing geopolitical challenges, disruption can continue to persist,” Forney said. “More domestic capability is not only an appropriate response, but a necessary one.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchin said the war showed the need for the U.S. to be self-sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot replace one unreliable foreign supply chain with another and think it’s going to solve our problems,” Manchin said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Nevada ‘nexus’</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said Nevada was uniquely positioned as the “nexus for our clean energy and critical mineral future” because every aspect of lithium ion battery manufacturing — mining, production, assembly and recycling — was present in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Silver State Democrat compared Biden’s electric vehicles goal with President John F. Kennedy’s 1962 call to reach the moon by the end of that decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is our moonshot,” she said. “It is important for the administration to stake a goal for all of us to marshal resources. Whether we achieve that goal can always be in question, but at least we are moving in the same direction. Just like Kennedy did when he made his announcement that he was going to put a man on the moon, this is our moment to focus on a clean energy economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New production would not have to meet all new demand, experts told the panel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recycling could meet roughly 25-30% of the demand for the critical materials, J.B. Straubel, founder and CEO of lithium-ion battery recycling firm Redwood Materials, said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Britton, the executive director of the advocacy group Zero Emission Transportation Association, told U.S. Sen John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., that 95% of the minerals used in electric vehicle batteries could be recycled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., floated the idea of a carbon border fee to advantage U.S. supplies of critical minerals over imports from China. More stringent labor and environmental standards in the U.S. put domestic companies at a disadvantage, Cassidy said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding a fee on imports based on the carbon footprint of their production would “frankly, support our mining activity for critical minerals, as opposed to those who pay no attention whatsoever to environmental considerations,” Cassidy said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wood answered that he would worry about such a fee’s effects on the supply chain and inflation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats blamed the oil industry, Republicans blamed President Joe Biden and oil executives blamed global market forces at a U.S. House hearing Wednesday on how to reverse a dramatic increase in gas prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over nearly six hours, members of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and executives from six oil companies painted a complex picture of an industry reaping substantial profits, but still roiled by the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and federal regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and Republicans also differed on possible solutions to high prices. Democrats called for moving away from oil and gas and toward renewable sources of energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If this crisis has shown us anything, it&#8217;s why we as a country must work to break our addiction to oil as quickly as possible,” Subcommittee Chairwoman Diana DeGette, D-Colo., said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s reinforced the urgent and existential need to transition to a more sustainable energy future. For the sake of our economy, our environment and our national security, we must work as quickly as possible to go to that clean energy future.”</span></p>

Morgan Griffith, R-9th.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans said the administration should reverse policies that made energy production more difficult. Subcommittee ranking Republican Morgan Griffith of Virginia said Biden’s first-week actions to </span><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/biden-yanks-keystone-xl-permit-in-first-day-order-citing-climate-change/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cancel the XL Keystone crude oil pipeline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2021/03/22/four-big-questions-about-the-feds-scrutiny-of-oil-and-gas-leasing-on-public-lands/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ban new oil and gas leases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on federal lands discouraged domestic production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The majority is laying the blame for the problem at the wrong feet,” he said. “Rather than deflect blame, President Biden should consider his own culpability for higher energy prices thanks to his relentless pursuit of policies that discourage domestic energy production.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans also attacked the Biden administration’s claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine — and the subsequent sanctions on Russia and disruptions to the global supply of oil — are responsible for the rise in gas prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was happening before Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,” U.S. Rep. Earl “Buddy” Carter, R-Ga., said.   </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats slam big oil</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats on the panel chastised the companies for providing shareholder dividends and stock buybacks instead of reinvesting profits into more production or lowering prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DeGette noted crude oil had returned to the same price it was before Putin invaded Ukraine, yet gasoline remained 50 cents per gallon higher than it was</span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/PET_PRI_GND_A_EPMR_PTE_DPGAL_W.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in late February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The six companies represented at the hearing, bp America, Chevron, Devon Energy, ExxonMobil, Pioneer and Natural Resources Co. and Shell USA, recorded $75 billion in profits in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something doesn’t add up,” DeGette said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executives for major oil producers said individual gas stations — not the oil companies — set retail gas prices. Most gas stations, even those carrying a large company’s brand, are independently owned and operated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No single company sets the price of oil or gasoline,” ExxonMobil CEO Darren W. Woods said. “The market establishes the price based on available supply and the demand for that supply.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full committee Chairman Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat, rejected that argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bottom line is you set the wholesale price and that&#8217;s the biggest part of the real retail price,” he said. “So don&#8217;t tell us that you can&#8217;t do anything about it. You can do something about it. And we expect you to do that. Maybe it&#8217;s a matter of patriotism.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Democrats on the panel raised the prospect of reducing tax subsidies to energy companies, though the Ways and Means Committee is the primary House panel for tax law changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This committee is not going to sit back and allow this system, which forces American taxpayers to pay oil companies out of both pockets — first at the pump and then again through tax breaks — to continue in its current form,” DeGette said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chevron Chairman and CEO Michael K. Wirth said his company was providing both shareholder payments and increased production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re investing more capital to grow production,” Wirth said. “We can do that and return value to shareholders. They’re not mutually exclusive.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Production was also hurt by industry changes during the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. As demand dried up, companies slowed production. Returning to pre-pandemic levels is not simple, the executives said.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP blames climate action</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans on the panel said Democrats who now blast the industry for not producing enough had previously called for ending fossil fuel production.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden campaigned on climate pledges to move away from fossil fuel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“President Biden walked in on day one with an agenda to kill American energy,” House Minority Whip Steve Scalise said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Louisiana Republican then asked the executives if federal regulations made it harder to produce oil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wirth, Scott Sheffield of Pioneer and Richard E. Moncrief of Devon Energy all said regulations did make their business harder. Gretchen Watkins, Shell USA’s president, said some regulations were necessary, but that Shell was waiting on outstanding federal permits.  </span></p>

Donald McEachin, D-4th.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Donald McEachin of Virginia said Republicans’ attack on the Keystone XL pipeline decision was off base because that pipeline wouldn’t even be in operation yet if it had been approved. It was also primarily planned to transport Canadian oil to overseas markets, doing little for the domestic supply, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McEachin also asked each executive if a potential suspension of the 18.3 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax would translate to savings for consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executives responded that they would not collect the tax, but that the price of oil is not predictable, and they could not guarantee an exact price drop to match any tax waiver. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I&#8217;m trying to do is disabuse the American public of this myth that if we do something like declare a federal tax holiday that the price of gasoline will go down,” McEachin said. “We don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of a gas tax holiday, Congress should provide direct payments to help cover the cost of more expensive gas, he said.</span></p>
