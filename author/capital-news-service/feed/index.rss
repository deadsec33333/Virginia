<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Federal and state lawmakers have introduced legislation to strengthen support for and better protect sexual assault victims on college campuses, but the progress has been stagnant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A congressional bill introduced by a Virginia senator previously died and was reintroduced, but it is still in committee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A bill in the General Assembly recently died, with the final decision to kill it happening just months after Liberty University received the largest fine ever issued for breaking the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Act.</p>
<p dir="ltr">S.5086 &#8211; SOS Campus Act</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., reintroduced <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5086/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/5086/text&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Mw-4iqJSCMDBegjgUmwnw">a proposal</a> in September after an earlier <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4846?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%224846%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4846?q%3D%257B%2522search%2522%253A%25224846%2522%257D%26s%3D1%26r%3D9&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3U3oCMyRRr7zd4Ob-Hh5QY">version</a> died in the last session of Congress. This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965, which, among other things, created the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Act.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The act requires higher education institutions to provide support for victims of violent crimes and to make publicly available campus crime statistics and institutional policies for campus safety, according to the Clery Center.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kaine’s bill would require schools that receive federal funding to appoint an advocate, independent of the institution, who guides victims of sexual assault throughout the process. This would include better connection to available resources, emotional counseling and protection for the student from more harm – such as disciplinary action or penalization for reporting the incident.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill requires the advocate to report incidents to an investigative body and submit an annual report to the learning institution with the number of victims and how each resource was used.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SOS Campus Act was referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, according to Kaine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The inspiration for the legislation is to protect the rights of students to feel safe on campus, according to Kaine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s why I’ve worked on legislation, including the SOS Campus Act, to prevent sexual assault and support survivors,” Kaine stated. “I will keep working to garner support among my colleagues for the SOS Campus Act and work to get it passed and signed into law.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">HB 369 &#8211; Sexual Misconduct Policies and Task Force</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Marty Martinez, D-Loudoun, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB369" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB369&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0X1b_ife_8AXjVfJigr1-j">House Bill 369</a>, which had similar objectives to Kaine’s bill, to update sexual misconduct policies and increase accountability for institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was introduced in the 2024 General Assembly session, but a Rules subcommittee continued the bill to the 2025 session. The bill was officially left in that committee on Nov. 18, effectively killing it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill would create a task force which produced an annual climate survey, install a crisis center, establish a designated confidential adviser on all campuses and impose civil penalties for institutions that violate the proposed guidelines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia would appoint the task force, whose charge would be to create a base sexual misconduct campus climate survey, according to SCHEV communications director Bob Spieldenner. This survey would be distributed to all institutions across the state, which would be a routine task for SCHEV, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Schools could tailor the survey with campus-specific questions before sending them to students, according to the bill. The results would be shared with SCHEV and posted online within about four months for public viewing, along with the institution’s website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill required for-profit, private institutions to have a designated crisis center with a confidential, independent advocate to provide support to victims of sexual assault and direct them on the next steps. This is something that nonprofit, private universities are already required to do.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill also created accountability on institutions to report alleged incidents and investigations. If an institution did not take any action “after reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing,” then they would be fined up to $150,000 (or 1% of institution’s annual operating budget, whichever is lower) for each violation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, was a co-patron of the measure. The bill was a step toward the ultimate goal of every individual to feel safe at their school, he stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Virginia’s students have one job &#8212; to learn,” Helmer stated. “And as legislators, it’s our job to protect them when our schools won’t.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neither Martinez nor Helmer responded when asked if they had plans to reintroduce this bill or similar legislation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Liberty University Shows Cracks In System</p>
<p dir="ltr">Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg, reached a<a href="https://www.liberty.edu/news/2024/03/05/liberty-university-and-department-of-education-finalize-clery-program-review/#:~:text=Today%2C%20Liberty%20University%20and%20the,for%20new%20campus%20safety%20improvements." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.liberty.edu/news/2024/03/05/liberty-university-and-department-of-education-finalize-clery-program-review/%23:~:text%3DToday%252C%2520Liberty%2520University%2520and%2520the,for%2520new%2520campus%2520safety%2520improvements.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1732371896430000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3D9-H1qVQPcIQp0Ey8yXaX"> $14 million settlement agreement</a> with the U.S. Department of Education over Clery Act violations, according to Liberty University.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Close races within margin of recount</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Over 180 miles from Richmond, the winner of a Southwestern mayoral race in Roanoke was clear only the day before election results were officially certified.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democratic Vice Mayor Joe Cobb clinched a 59-vote victory in a three-way race. The city’s former mayor, Republican David A. Bowers was ahead initially, and even <a href="https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2024/11/08/vice-mayor-joe-cobb-leading-race-for-roanoke-mayor-as-of-friday-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsls.com/news/local/2024/11/08/vice-mayor-joe-cobb-leading-race-for-roanoke-mayor-as-of-friday-night/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731786298014000&amp;usg=AOvVaw13g0FdoT0wAk9L-hU_igYH">declared</a> victory. However, absentee ballots later placed Cobb ahead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The state deadline for mailed absentee ballots was noon on Friday, Nov. 8. There were also 1,223 provisional ballots to be tallied, according to Nicholas Ocampo, Roanoke’s director of elections and general registrar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the first mayoral race in Roanoke with same-day <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/same-day-voter-registration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/same-day-voter-registration/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731786298014000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0TYmRRhmjZir5I_5RL0J2p">registration</a>, Ocampo stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This process requires extra steps to verify each voter’s eligibility to vote in the polling location in which their ballot was cast.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Jerrad Lee leaves his Midlothian house at 5:20 a.m., skipping the morning cup of coffee if he is running late.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lee arrives at the Staples Mill Amtrak station just in time to catch the 6:05 a.m. train to Union Station in Washington. Once on the train, he stops by the cafe cart to grab his favorite menu item: egg bites. Lee settles in his seat, pulls out a laptop and works for the next two hours until the train arrives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lee is a supervisor for the U.S. Department of Labor, on the unemployment insurance improvement team. He has commuted to Washington since the beginning of the year, and now works a hybrid schedule of one week remote, the next in person.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Coming home just depends on my meeting schedule,” Lee said. “Thankfully, there are trains that run at 2:35, 3:50, and 5:50. Or, worst case scenario, 7:25.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He wishes there was just one more afternoon route to Richmond. Regardless, the options allow Lee to stay as long as he needs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lee and other commuters avoid the gridlock and delays that are often part of traveling to the nation’s capital. Passenger rail also allows people like Lee to work in Washington and live in a smaller, more affordable area, such as Richmond.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I avoid that like the plague,” Lee said. “This allows us to live here and enjoy just how awesome and relaxed and chill of an area that Richmond is.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amtrak ridership numbers have rebounded from peak-COVID years and are up from over a decade ago. President Joe Biden, avid train fan and commuter, pushed billions toward rail improvements as part of his drive to improve infrastructure. Although Biden’s administration is leaving the station, the transportation improvements are just getting underway in Virginia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">State transportation advocates look forward to how the next administration could expand on these initiatives.</p>

The act was designed to improve U.S. infrastructure, not just transportation, but to expand clean water access, increase high-speed internet access and reduce greenhouse emissions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/BUILDING-A-BETTER-AMERICA-V2.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/BUILDING-A-BETTER-AMERICA-V2.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731528677632000&amp;usg=AOvVaw05PGdypKJ-jzVOOr_PcmBq" target="_blank">allocated</a> $66 billion for the improvement of passenger rail and will provide up to an additional $36 billion over the next five years for the Department of Transportation’s rail programs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Key Virginia improvements have been underway since before the Biden administration, such as the Long Bridge project in Northern Virginia, which has been in the works since 2011. The funds helped advance the plans.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Passenger Rail Authority formed to handle the state’s rail projects. The new Long Bridge will add two additional tracks over the Potomac River to help ease heavy train traffic. In addition, the VPRA plans to construct a dedicated pedestrian and bicycle bridge alongside the existing bridge.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funded several grants and initiatives, including the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program, according to the DOT <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/funding-and-financing/grants-overview#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20members,in%20America%E2%80%99s%20infrastructure." data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.transportation.gov/rural/grant-toolkit/funding-and-financing/grants-overview%23:~:text%3DIn%25202021%252C%2520members,in%2520America%25E2%2580%2599s%2520infrastructure.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731528677632000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Gm3tkuTn3FRh7hq2OJMQp" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Railroad Administration in 2023 <a href="https://vapassengerrailauthority.org/vpra-receives-federal-grant-in-support-of-transforming-rail-in-virginia-initiative/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vapassengerrailauthority.org/vpra-receives-federal-grant-in-support-of-transforming-rail-in-virginia-initiative/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731528677632000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tZEyWsupi6NLiZwrwnjJ5" target="_blank">awarded</a> the VPRA $729 million in grant funding for Long Bridge and other projects.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">DJ Stadtler is the VPRA executive director. Virginia already had projects in development, and the Biden administration helped with funding, Stadtler said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We were able to take advantage of those funding opportunities, and that’s really helped us stay on schedule,” Stadtler said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Long Bridge project is in phase four of its plan, which encompasses design and construction. The project is estimated to be completed by 2030, according to the VPRA’s <a href="https://vapassengerrailauthority.org/longbridgeproject/#project-timeline" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vapassengerrailauthority.org/longbridgeproject/%23project-timeline&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731528677632000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2uNPPUOmpMs2fL5_EDsx4z" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the next administration could continue these improvements</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on hefty investment in rail infrastructure in 2016. When he was first in office, his administration reduced funding for the DOT across several sectors, including Amtrak’s 15 long-distance routes, according to <a href="https://www.railway-technology.com/features/what-has-trump-done-for-the-us-rail-industry/?cf-view" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.railway-technology.com/features/what-has-trump-done-for-the-us-rail-industry/?cf-view&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731528677632000&amp;usg=AOvVaw12M_oZy8-IZ_34qB5zLWJo" target="_blank">Railway Technology</a>. Industry experts described Trump’s railway policy as “inconsistent.”</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/11/07/trump-dc-federal-workforce-cuts/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/11/07/trump-dc-federal-workforce-cuts/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731528677632000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1hN0A_NaYC0JXppav80GIP" target="_blank">promised</a> to trim the federal workforce by eliminating and relocating thousands of positions, which could impact the number of train commuters.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Vice President Kamala Harris supported development of high-speed rail in her home state of California during her time as the state’s attorney general. Harris in 2017 <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/824080345926664192" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/824080345926664192&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1731528677632000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1sI_7emTc67Uvm1g0Vbt5D" target="_blank">called</a> infrastructure spending a “human rights issue.” Many Americans cannot afford to live where they work and need better transportation, according to Harris.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Danny Plaugher is executive director of both the Virginia Transit Association and Virginians for High Speed Rail.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Long Bridge is a historic project, and Virginia also received $100 million for the Franconia-Springfield Bypass, Plaugher said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Those two grants are the largest rail grants that Virginia has ever received, and both of those came under the IIJA,” Plaugher said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Money should be invested in passenger rail, rather than roads, according to Plaugher. It costs billions to add lanes to roadways such as Interstate 95. States get more use out of the same money when they put it toward rail.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We have proven time and again that we are never going to pave our way out of traffic,” Plaugher said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As far as the possibility of the federal government taking away Virginia’s allocated grant funding, Plaugher said “not easily.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Both parties should support the railway efforts, according to Lee. He will commute as long as current standards are upheld and improvements continue.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“In my mind, rail should be bipartisan,” Lee said. “I mean, I think anyone in Richmond who has tried to drive to D.C. for work would absolutely understand that we can't just expand 95 and magically, it'll be awesome. You know? So I would just say continued funding and infrastructure improvements.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Central Virginia voters showed up to the polls on Tuesday Nov. 5 for their last chance to make their voices heard in the 2024 election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voters, depending on their locality, voted for a presidential candidate, a Senate seat, congressional representative, a state constitutional amendment and local positions, such as mayor and city council. The City of Petersburg will also vote on a casino referendum, which the City of Richmond rejected twice at the polls.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Almost 6.4 million Virginians are registered to vote, and 2.3 million votes were cast <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20241105/potus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20241105/potus/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730933974900000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2iIzDOs2CLjpZwbgSonvmG">early</a>, a figure that is down from 2020, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Capital News Service reporters traveled to polling locations in Chesterfield, Goochland and Henrico Counties, and the cities of Petersburg and Richmond.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly has a 10-point lead in Virginia over former President Donald Trump, according to a <a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_election_2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_election_2024&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730933974900000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1rxP0pR_ZbZAEwNVuUq-Yv">poll</a> by Roanoke College. There was a Republican push for early voting, encouraged strongly by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and even Trump, who appeared at a rally in Salem on Saturday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The vote count begins when polls close at 7 p.m., and provisional ballots will not be counted until later in the week.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RICHMOND, Va. — On Tuesday morning, outside the Virginia Commonwealth University polling location on the second floor of the Student Commons, several students shared their same-day voter registration experiences and the top policy issues driving their choice between presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Reproductive rights, housing and economic policy were among the young voters’ chief concerns.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Many students use same-day voter registration and provisional ballots</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TriVonda Mines, the chief officer of elections at the VCU Student Commons polling location, the largest precinct in the area, saw a steady flow of voters since the 6 a.m. start, but noted it had not been as busy as previous presidential elections. She expects around 1,800 to 2,100 votes Tuesday, she said, and anticipates at least 300 of those to be provisional ballots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A problem with provisional ballots on college campuses is that students often mix up their residency and home address. Students in residence halls must put their residence address, not their home address, in order to have their vote count in the district, according to Mines. The Commons polling location included a separate area designated for provisional ballots, a ballot used when a voter cannot confirm proper identification or forgot to register in advance.</span></p>

(Katie Farthing/Capital News Service)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jyson Willow, a senior interdisciplinary studies student at VCU, voted using a provisional ballot because he forgot about the registration deadline. Willow moved to the Richmond area over a year ago and still doesn’t have a Virginia license, so he was unable to register online beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it was stressful, just because of the amount of people that were having to do it today,” Willow said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willow said he was glad voting via provisional ballot was easy because choosing a presidential candidate is stressful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s almost like picking the lesser of two evils, because I don’t necessarily align perfectly with one party,” Willow said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caitlin Przywara, a senior information systems student at VCU, also voted using a provisional ballot because she did not originally plan to vote and thought she had missed her chance to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It actually went by pretty fast,” Przywara said. “We didn’t know if we could register, we thought it was too late.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After casting their provisional ballot, voters have until Friday, Nov. 8 at 10 a.m. to provide valid identification, after which the local electoral board decides which provisional ballots will be counted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Truesdale, the chief election officer at the George Washington Carver Elementary School, anticipated a majority of provisional ballots. The elementary school is a polling location for two upperclassmen residence halls at VCU. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Institute of Contemporary Art is a polling location for one VCU residence hall and Chief Officer of Elections Brooks Braun noted a steady flow of voters and anticipated around 60 provisional ballots by the time polls close. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Student voters focused on reproductive health care, housing, economic policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the college students interviewed shared that they voted for Harris, because her policy positions most closely resemble their own.s</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with being an advocate for women’s rights, Yurida Martinez, a freshman, said the Harris housing policy plan to provide a $25,000 downpayment for first-time homebuyers appealed to her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanessa Lemus, a graduate student, agreed and added, “I really like the credit for first-time homebuyers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m already 26 years old, so (homeownership) is something I want to do in the future, in a couple of years,” Lemus said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemus, who identifies as queer, said Trump’s proposed policy that would expand corporate tax cuts would only help “if you’re making six figures or more.” That, and Trump’s rhetoric disparaging immigrants and others, dissuaded her from voting for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Throughout his presidency, the last time he was president, and throughout the campaign, he really just kind of used harmful rhetoric toward different marginalized groups,” Lemus said. “Not only that, but (Trump) has allowed for people that are voting for him to feel like it’s ok to do as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Przywara did not vote in the 2020 election, but chose to this year because of her dislike for Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve already seen what Trump has done,” Przywara said. “It’s gonna be different, if she (Harris) does become President.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sparse support for Trump Tuesday, Lemus said, is on trend for a liberal campus in an urban center of the state that reliably votes Democratic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a very liberal campus, a very eccentric, collective campus where you have a lot of different types of students coming from different backgrounds, different places,” Lemus said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Advocates say same-day voting tears down barriers for student voters</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same-day registration across Virginia’s college campuses “has been huge,” said Will Winters, state director for NextGen America, a non-partisan advocacy group focused on youth voting. The Virginia legislature passing its same-day registration law in 2020, which took effect in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/13/same-day-voter-registration-is-coming-to-virginia-heres-how-itll-work/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has “torn down a lot of barriers to voting,” for students, he said. That expanded access leads candidates to engage with young voters more, Winters said, and makes it easier for all citizens to participate in the democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot of people that don’t think about elections ‘til the last second. We see all these ads and we look at polls, but there’s a lot of people in this country that are paying attention to other things,” Winters said in a phone interview from the campus of University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg. “If somebody’s moved to a different apartment, maybe they’ve changed cities for a job, same-day registration helps just make that really easy and available for those people to still have a say in our democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winters declined to share how many people NextGen America has registered, but said Millenial and Gen Z voters are going to have a </span><a href="https://www.whro.org/elections/2024-11-03/what-virginias-college-voters-care-most-about-in-presidential-election" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“huge voice”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year. This year’s turnout, he said, is stemming from the high-profile national election, and comes after the group’s work with young voters in 2023 ahead of Virginia’s pivotal General Assembly election where all 140 seats were on the ballot. The group did outreach in Blacksburg, home to Virginia Tech, and the Hampton Roads area, which hosts several universities including Norfolk State and Christopher Newport universities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It just seems, generally, students are engaged,” Winters said.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Virginia U.S. Senate candidates Tim Kaine, the two-term incumbent, and Hung Cao shared their opposing views on immigration at the Oct. 2 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIPd0xdlhrA&amp;t=1589s" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DWIPd0xdlhrA%26t%3D1589s&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ULvq7-CSXwPwYg2waLGTL">debate</a>, held at Norfolk State University.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Immigration reform might be the one best thing that can be done by Congress to expand the American economy,” Democratic candidate Kaine said at the debate. “We need to protect the border and we need to have the workforce America needs going into the future.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kaine said the mass deportation of over 10 million immigrants proposed by former President Donald Trump’s campaign would devastate the economy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Republican candidate Cao, who immigrated from Vietnam, many <a href="https://vcucns.com/2024/10/13/on-the-issues-2024-va-senator-election-guide/#step-immigration" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vcucns.com/2024/10/13/on-the-issues-2024-va-senator-election-guide/%23step-immigration&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2E8u4IkfXaiQMUBAbynC8J">policy responses</a> tie back to the border, especially housing instability, crime and the federal deficit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you came here illegally, you are basically screwing up the whole system,” Cao said at the debate. “There are people that are waiting in line like my family for seven years for their naturalization papers. So you cannot jump the line.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way immigration data is tracked has changed, which makes it harder to directly compare illegal immigration during President Joe Biden’s administration to other administrations, according to the fact-checking website <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/jan/03/key-facts-about-immigration-data-what-it-can-and-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/jan/03/key-facts-about-immigration-data-what-it-can-and-c/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0poVRCAaNe-3NIr6i039WE">Politifact</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is hard to determine how single U.S. immigration policies in the past decade influence illegal immigration, according to a Bipartisan Policy Centers <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/changing-border-policies-and-apprehensions-whats-the-relationship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/changing-border-policies-and-apprehensions-whats-the-relationship/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0sK9egB7wKGo4ZEvQNRm5x">report</a> released last December. And numbers do not always explain why people leave their home countries, Politifact found.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of Biden’s first actions in 2021 was to halt construction of Trump’s border wall, and to send Congress a bill that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-sends-immigration-bill-to-congress-as-part-of-his-commitment-to-modernize-our-immigration-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/fact-sheet-president-biden-sends-immigration-bill-to-congress-as-part-of-his-commitment-to-modernize-our-immigration-system/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1BM3XIc2OZNDpl6ZNVGM7W">modernized</a> the U.S. immigration system and created pathways to citizenship for undocumented individuals.

<p dir="ltr">Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy in 2017 and enacted a Muslim travel ban in 2018 that the U.S. Supreme Court overturned. If elected, he promised to complete the Mexico-U.S. border wall he started in 2018.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia immigrants want reform and opportunity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Several people who immigrated to Virginia told VCU Capital News Service they want reform and opportunity, something they hear about more from the Democratic Party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Valesca Bonilla immigrated to Virginia from Honduras and is a member of CASA in Action, an organization which advocates for legislative change at the statehouse. The Democratic Party is receptive to the community and immigration reform, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “The more numbers we are, the better we are together,” Bonilla said. “If we don't try to educate ourselves and educate others and come together, we’re not gonna make it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bonilla said immigration reform begins with small steps, such as a smoother process for worker permits and more temporary protected status, or TPS, allowances for migrants whose native countries are considered unsafe. This program grants the ability to live and work in the U.S. for a fixed period of time, and is something Kaine has <a href="https://timkaine.com/issues/fighting-for-immigrant-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://timkaine.com/issues/fighting-for-immigrant-communities/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bnS0FPWHt5yaXfcOJ7_5O">defended</a> in the Senate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hector Joya, a Salvadoran immigrant, said programs like DACA and TPS are essential to immigrants in the country. There needs to be more programs that can help expand visa accessibility. He is an organizer with CASA in Action.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Joya cannot vote. But, he said immigrants can lean toward the Democratic Party because it is more receptive to immigrant needs and presence. Other voting groups should consider immigration policy because of the strong economic contributions from immigrants, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Naturalized citizens not unified voting bloc</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Gabriela León-Pérez, an assistant professor of sociology at Virginia Commonwealth University, immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico. The U.S. has always been dependent on immigrant labor and not only in lower-skilled jobs, but also highly skilled jobs in fields like STEM.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That is how Mexican immigration even started in the late 1800s, because of active recruitment of cheap labor,” León-Pérez said. “Not only are immigrants contributing to society in economic and labor terms, but also culturally, in the arts. There are many areas that immigrants play an integral role in society.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Her current research project asks immigrants what they would like the public to know about them and many set the record straight, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They want people to know that they're not here to take jobs and that they're here to work and to contribute to society,” León-Pérez said. “Immigrants actually complement the U.S.-born population because the types of jobs that immigrants hold are different from the ones that the U.S.-born population holds, so, rather than taking away, they're complementing each other in the labor market.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, León-Pérez said it can be difficult to generalize policies that all immigrants hope for because it varies based on country of origin, class, legal status and how they arrived. León-Pérez believes naturalized citizens can’t be perceived as a voting bloc because of how varied the group is, she said. There is a wide range of political beliefs, although people think they’re more Democratic leaning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There’s a growing population of Latinos who support the Republican Party, so can’t really say that immigrants as a whole or even different racial, ethnic groups, support a specific political party,” León-Pérez said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Former delegate and immigrant says: ‘Vote’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Elizabeth Guzman, a former Democratic delegate who represented Prince William and Fauquier counties, is a naturalized citizen. On Election Day, a candidate’s stances on immigration guide her vote, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump previously made comments that immigrants poison the country and accused them of taking American jobs, according to <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/21/fact-check-12000-trump-statements-immigrants" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/21/fact-check-12000-trump-statements-immigrants&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730738906446000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1PJcgk0oAryYBjb_U45R2Q">The Marshall Project</a>. Guzman said this perception is unfair and disappointing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are just tired, being used for his campaign slogan but never acknowledge the contributions we have made,” Guzman said. “We are in a historic moment where we have immigrants leading government agencies … if they were given the job it’s because they were qualified to do that job and ready for that challenge.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Guzman, who is originally from Peru and a native Spanish speaker, said immigrants have to work twice as hard as their American counterparts to reach higher positions like elected office. Immigrants shouldn’t feel less American because of the color of their skin or their last name, Guzman said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re here to work, and we’re here to succeed and pave way for future generations,” Guzman said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Higher education should be accessible as long as immigrants pay taxes and respect the law, according to Guzman. Reform like that can increase their contributions to Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New voting generations must think about the future they want to grow up in, where everyone is treated with respect and dignity, Guzman said. Second-generation immigrants don’t want to live in a country where their tax-paying parents are disrespected and not valued.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia has made it easier to participate in the election with early voting and people must decide whether they want to be a part of the solution or the problem, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Participate. Vote,” Guzman said. “Your vote is your voice and if you don’t participate, then don’t complain.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Election Day is Tuesday, Nov. 5. The polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. Same-day voter registration is allowed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. — Diversity Richmond, a local nonprofit that supports the Greater Richmond area’s LGBTQ+ community, released a preliminary design for its new “Celebrate Diversity” state license plate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Diversity Richmond hopes the license plate will increase visibility for the community, according to the Rev. Lacette Cross, who is also executive director of the organization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We wanted to do it because that is the vision — to create a region where we’re all welcome, included and safe, and we do that through visibility,” Cross said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The organization wanted a license plate that reflected the diversity within the LGBTQ+ community across Virginia. Staff input and community responses contributed to the final design. It was in the works for around 15 months, and then released in September, right after Diversity Richmond’s 25th anniversary, according to Cross.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Everything just came together at the right time,” Cross said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Diversity Richmond is the first to propose an initiative like this in Virginia, according to Cross.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any special license plate by <a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/documents/platesponsor_special.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/documents/platesponsor_special.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1729952030500000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0guAY4WMujPbMS-4l2TYbf">law</a> requires 450 applications and payments before the start of the next General Assembly session, which is Jan. 8, 2025. The effort also needs a legislative sponsor, who will be Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, according to Cross.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The estimated timeline for customers to receive the plates is approximately nine months after the General Assembly approves the legislation, according to <a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/documents/platesponsor_special.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/documents/platesponsor_special.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1729952030500000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0guAY4WMujPbMS-4l2TYbf">DMV</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The organization has sold around 15% of the plates necessary for submission and plans to host Zoom and in-person application parties to encourage people to apply, Cross said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All applicants will be refunded if Diversity Richmond is unable to meet the minimum number of applications for approval, according to its <a href="https://www.diversityrichmond.org/celebrate-diversity-license-plate" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.diversityrichmond.org/celebrate-diversity-license-plate&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1729952030500000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1X5z84NaaIl3J7gu5DqABo">website</a>. Plates are $25, or $35 with personalization. Personalized plates can have six characters maximum, though handicapped plates have a maximum of five, according to the <a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/forms/vsa10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/forms/vsa10.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1729952030500000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bFtcdiISL3BABir8_E0Xy">DMV</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ten dollars from every plate purchased, pending approval, goes toward the organization, which in turn supports the Greater Richmond LGBTQ+ community through events, an art gallery and funding other nonprofits, according to Cross.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are about the potential to have a way to raise visibility and continue to bring in donations and financial support for the ongoing mission for Diversity Richmond,” Cross said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The organization’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/diversityrichmond/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.instagram.com/diversityrichmond/?hl%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1729952030500000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zyi87IqMD9HeGmF1ud7db">Instagram</a> will have dates for application parties, and the applications are available on Diversity Richmond’s <a href="https://www.diversityrichmond.org/celebrate-diversity-license-plate" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.diversityrichmond.org/celebrate-diversity-license-plate&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1729952030500000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1X5z84NaaIl3J7gu5DqABo">website</a>. Only the organization can collect the application and fees at this phase in the plate development process, not DMV.</p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; College students from nine Virginia universities spent a recent weekend at the State Capitol to learn about the legislative process through a government simulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students elected leadership positions within their respective parties, with roles that included majority and minority leader, as well as majority and minority whip. They had a bill book and used the same parliamentary rules followed by state lawmakers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This was the inaugural <a href="https://idpce.vcu.edu/va-government-simulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://idpce.vcu.edu/va-government-simulation/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1728760207726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2rRNjTkjykvKzuVRnBD7JF">Virginia Government Simulation</a>, inspired by similar college programs in Tennessee and Illinois. <a href="https://idpce.vcu.edu/va-government-simulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://idpce.vcu.edu/va-government-simulation/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1728760207726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2rRNjTkjykvKzuVRnBD7JF">The three-day event, starting Oct. 3, was</a> an initiative of the Institute for Democracy, Pluralism, and Community Empowerment at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Amanda Wintersieck is an associate professor of political science at VCU and the IDPCE director. She helped organize the simulation. Faculty from Bridgewater College and Radford University contributed to the creation of the event, and served as advisers on the executive board.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students debated 15 bills in the House chamber from the <a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=lnk&amp;val=73" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D241%26typ%3Dlnk%26val%3D73&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1728760207726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2zr4tz-dzBiKrc8caS4CLX">2024</a> legislative session. Bills covered topics such as artificial intelligence, cannabis advertising and single-use plastics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bridgewater junior Jory Cardoza was surprised to be elected majority leader, but said it was easy to step into the role once the simulation started. Cardoza also acted as House speaker for the simulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think people have really cool ideas about what they want to see in government,” Cardoza said. “So just like facilitating … was really cool, trying to allow everybody time to speak their mind.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Data shows Americans generally do not have a solid understanding of how their state legislatures work, Wintersieck said. About half of the respondents to a <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/12/14/americans-dont-understand-state-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://hub.jhu.edu/2018/12/14/americans-dont-understand-state-government/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1728760207726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bBEWuHLEdWG72abLg4ULg">survey</a> conducted by John Hopkins University did not know if their state had a one or two-chamber legislature, and that one-third were unable to name their state’s governor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is pretty discouraging, because I know while national politics are sexy and they get all the money and all the advertisements and all the news attention, the reality is the laws that impact us every single day are the laws of our states,” Wintersieck said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“High impact” experiences allow students to retain information better than if they had learned about the project in a government class, according to Wintersieck.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In three, five, 10 years they&#8217;re going to have retained more of that information because they engaged in it in a more realistic setting,” Wintersieck said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jackson Mallory attends VCU, and helped organize the event as part of a work study position. He hopes to work in politics one day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The government simulation provides students with networking and career development opportunities, in addition to learning about the legislative process firsthand, according to Mallory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s not just about debating,” Mallory said. “It&#8217;s about decorum. It&#8217;s about respect for the participants in the chamber. It&#8217;s about respect for yourself.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students were randomly assigned political parties prior to the event. They researched the viewpoints and arguments of political parties they may not be aligned with, which helps build critical thinking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It really forces them to engage with thinking about how somebody from a different political persuasion thinks about things,” Wintersieck said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jarrett Lilly is a sophomore at Bridgewater College who described himself as a moderate conservative. He was assigned to act as a Democrat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to get into the mindset of someone from the opposite party, it is crucial to understand why someone believes a certain way, according to Lilly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Maybe I don&#8217;t agree with it but at the same time, I can understand where this person is coming from and they really do want to make a difference,” Lilly said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After debate and amendments, the delegates passed 14 bills. Elected officials could take notice of the efficiency from their younger counterparts &#8212; state lawmakers this past session passed 45% of the bills introduced.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A 2022 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/09/as-partisan-hostility-grows-signs-of-frustration-with-the-two-party-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/09/as-partisan-hostility-grows-signs-of-frustration-with-the-two-party-system/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1728760207726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw14aNNPL8UNix12j6YBHwbN">study</a> done by Pew Research Center found that around 69% of Republican respondents regarded Democrats as closed-minded, while 83% of Democrats said the same about Republicans. Those percentages had double-digit increases from 2016. Each party increasingly views the people in the other party, not just the party itself, in a negative light, according to the study.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The success rate of these temporary legislators may have to do with their age and partisan flexibility, according to Lilly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I feel like previous generations are very much so set in their beliefs,” Lilly said. “I feel like a lot of us are more open to being able to have a conversation.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Summer Neil is a VCU sophomore pursuing a major in social work studies, and a minor in political science. She was initially disappointed to be selected as a Republican for the simulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The experience was more fun than anticipated, and she was surprised to find she supported some of the bills introduced by Republicans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think it’ll help me remove all of my bias and be a little more willing to really read into how things are, rather than how I perceive them to be,” Neil said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The participants compromised across their political ideology and party, which Wintersieck applauded.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s really clear that young Democrats and young Republicans can agree on things that previously could not be agreed upon between these two parties, and I think that’s encouraging in some ways,” Wintersieck said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Organizers hope to expand the legislative simulation to include the Senate, and also make other elements more robust. The organizers envision the opportunity to participate as part of the press corps or as lobbyists. There could also be judiciary and executive branch roles that add to the simulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Such future models could see 400-700 students in attendance, and involve other disciplines of study, according to Wintersieck.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Betsy Carr, D-Richmond, closed out the session with a speech on the value of public service and encouraged students to remain engaged and committed to making a difference.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Football season has kicked off and stretches from September to February. The sport is forecasted to bring in $35 billion in legal bets this season, according to the American Gaming Association. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia it is one of the top types of sports wagers made, according to Virginia Lottery gaming </span><a href="https://www.valottery.com/aboutus/casinosandsportsbetting" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sports betting started in Virginia in 2021. It generated almost $69 million in taxes in fiscal year 2023, according to a legislative </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD107/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yFL2XNkw1H"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/how-virginia-is-addressing-the-dark-side-of-gambling/">How Virginia is addressing the dark side of gambling</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;How Virginia is addressing the dark side of gambling&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/how-virginia-is-addressing-the-dark-side-of-gambling/embed/#?secret=oPiADtk1I3#?secret=yFL2XNkw1H" data-secret="yFL2XNkw1H" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That revenue is stacking coffers in U.S. states for totals in the billions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More people are sports betting now, and people in their early 20s are the fastest-growing group of gamblers, according to a 2023 </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/07/how-gambling-affects-the-brain" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">repor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">t from the American Psychological Association, or APA. Nearly two-thirds of adolescents, ages 12 to 18, report having an experience with gambling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts worry early exposure to gambling could lead to gambling addiction, and could be linked to higher risks of mental distress, according to the APA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Paul Tonko, D-New York, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, recently introduced legislation to tackle problem gambling, known as the ‘‘</span><a href="https://tonko.house.gov/uploadedfiles/tonko_055_xml_final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAFE Bet Act.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’’ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill calls for a nationwide 12-month long survey to better provide data on the scope of “problem gambling and gambling-related harm experienced by individuals using online sports betting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualified researchers would collect the data, and the study would not be sponsored by the gambling industry.The findings would be made available to the public, according to the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also proposes a national self-exclusion list, where individuals can restrict themselves from placing a sports wager with a sports wagering operator, and also a process for a person to add or remove themselves from the list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports betting does not require a bettor to walk into a casino and there are no set hours of operation. Someone can place a bet from their couch, or on their phone at any time of the day. The ads are also not regulated, so people consume sports betting promotions on social media and TV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The August numbers recently released by the </span><a href="https://www.valottery.com/winnersnews/latestwinners?itemId=%7B0BE60401-C670-4F14-BBBD-6E69CB5CAB87%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Lottery</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show a 30.6% increase over the previous year. Virginians placed over $416 million in bets in August and won over $376 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jaleel Patterson, a senior at Virginia Tech, places bets a few times a week, and definitely on Sundays because “NFL season is here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has turned a profit, but not enough to be a sustainable income. Sports betting can be entertaining with friends who enjoy the competition, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If your favorite team is playing their favorite team, you will gamble and say ‘oh, my team is gonna beat your team,’” Patterson said. “Between friends, I feel like that makes it more fun compared to just doing it on your own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important for a bettor to determine what they want to spend, and even the amount of time they will spend on the apps, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Only play with what you are willing to lose,” Patterson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brendan Dwyer is the director of research at the Center for Sport Leadership at Virginia Commonwealth University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Sports betting] is a potentially fun activity if done responsibly,” Dwyer said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He expects the amount of money wagered on sports across the U.S. will eventually slow down, but not in the immediate future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think we’ve completely penetrated the market,” Dwyer said. “I think we are still having new sports fans feel comfortable sports betting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Males under age 25 are most likely to become problem bettors, including betting money they don’t have or behaving irresponsibly, according to Dwyer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think that’s unique to sports betting,” Dwyer said. “It’s something you see with alcohol consumption, drug use, and anything that involves regulating your behavior. Sports betting is an extra activity that fuels that misbehavior.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports betting isn’t any more emotional than gambling in a casino, Dwyer said. But when a bettor has a specific attachment to a sports team, it can be more emotional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you don’t bet and you watch a football game, you’re going to be emotional about your favorite football team playing,” Dwyer said.”Sports in general is just more emotional.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Carolyn Hawley is an associate professor at VCU and president of the Virginia Council on Problem Gambling, which operates a helpline. She is also a past member of the Board of Directors of the National Council on Problem Gambling.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The helpline received 526 intakes from January through June 2024, according to the Virginia Council on Problem Gambling. This is a 16% increase from the previous year&#8217;s data points of January through June 2023, and a 64% increase from 2022 over the same time period, according to the Council.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state helpline has seen a shift in the age of callers, which used to be older individuals who had gambled for years before developing a problem, Hawley said in a previous Capital News Service </span><a href="https://wydaily.com/latest-news/2023/12/15/virginia-problem-gambling-services-need-more-funding-advocates-say/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs of problem gambling can be when it has a certain priority throughout a person’s daily life, according to Hawley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you spending a lot of time thinking about gambling and planning your next gambling activity?” Hawley said. “Are you spending more time gambling than you would with other activities that you used to enjoy? Do you need more and more to get that same level of excitement?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who thinks they have a gambling problem can contact the confidential and toll-free helpline at 1-888-532-3500 or visit the website: </span><a href="https://vcpg.net/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://vcpg.net/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr">State Attorney General Jason Miyares denounced student demonstrations last November, and <a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/99d2bc94-226a-42bb-8bea-28f626cda252.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/99d2bc94-226a-42bb-8bea-28f626cda252.pdf?rdr%3Dtrue&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0_iVf3xynaASRHRn1cagNa">stated</a> Jewish students felt unsafe and threatened by certain chants and slogans that called for a free Palestine. Miyares concluded some of the speech is antisemitic and might not be protected by the First Amendment, because it could incite “imminent lawless action”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Miyares recommended Virginia colleges implement policy changes to foster safer campuses and avoid disruptions of the educational environment, according to communications director Shaun Kenney</p>
<p dir="ltr">State Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera in August urged governing board members of Virginia universities to update their codes of conduct, according to an <a href="https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Campus-Safety-and-Security-A-Message-From-Secretary-of-Education-copy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Campus-Safety-and-Security-A-Message-From-Secretary-of-Education-copy.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw02107xq0feGQeYCohQqbGw">email</a> statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Considering the challenges faced on college and university campuses last academic year and reports that the fall will be even more chaotic, we have asked each institution take proactive steps to update policies” Guidera stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Students for Justice in Palestine has chapters across Virginia that organize campus demonstrations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">State leaders, in multiple statements and most <a href="https://virginia-senate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=3&amp;clip_id=6906" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginia-senate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id%3D3%26clip_id%3D6906&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2V9LXzBPrrb615EXYsvi4L">recently</a> at a legislative hearing, highlight the SJP as a source of antisemitism and disruption on campuses.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Last academic year, an anti-abortion campus event at VCU also ended in disruption, when abortion-rights <a href="https://commonwealthtimes.org/2023/04/14/protesters-were-assaulted-at-pro-life-event-now-demand-apology-from-vcu-president/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commonwealthtimes.org/2023/04/14/protesters-were-assaulted-at-pro-life-event-now-demand-apology-from-vcu-president/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2voFW1rYUx5qHcntwx734y">protesters</a> interrupted a meeting because they did not want people “spewing hate on our campus,” according to the Commonwealth Times.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new policies will impact how and where student organizations meet moving forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sereen Haddad is a Palestinian student and organizer for the SJP chapter at VCU since October 2023. Haddad has regularly helped host peaceful protests in support of Palestine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Haddad is concerned the policies intended to protect free speech, actually infringe on free speech rights. The new policies limit outlets for peaceful protests, she said. Students can only display posters the size of a letter-size piece of paper and assemble in designated areas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s very clear that quite frankly all these policies that are being put in place are no way promoting safety, instead they do promote fear and they promote silence,” Haddad said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 25-year-old Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression is a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization that defends free speech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">FIRE rates and tracks the policies that regulate student expression at almost 500 colleges and universities. It works to ensure students are able to lawfully protest, and reaches out to universities whose policies violate the First Amendment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Laura Beltz, director of policy reform at FIRE, has seen the impact of increased policies regarding student demonstrations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We&#8217;ve seen a lot of policy changes happening this academic year,” Beltz said. “An unprecedented number of new restrictions on the way students can get out and express themselves on campus.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">No Virginia universities are in direct violation of the First Amendment, yet these institutions have taken a heavy hand through new restrictive policies, according to Beltz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I&#8217;m concerned that students will see these new regulations when they come back to campus and the message they will receive is that it&#8217;s either too onerous to get out and express themselves or that there&#8217;s really no reasonable opportunity to do so,” Beltz said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">FIRE <a href="https://www.thefire.org/colleges/university-virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thefire.org/colleges/university-virginia&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1m1Fm2M9gDS3X8X7uYb9LZ">ranked</a> UVA. No. 1 in advertised commitments to free expression, on a list last updated in November 2023. The <a href="https://www.thefire.org/colleges" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thefire.org/colleges&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw01MnLThuvDLYa0zcMFUxOC">annual list</a> is set to be updated this fall, and will take into consideration the actions of universities over the past academic year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Senate Education and Health Committee <a href="https://virginia-senate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=3&amp;clip_id=6906" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginia-senate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id%3D3%26clip_id%3D6906&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727988385777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2V9LXzBPrrb615EXYsvi4L">met</a> Sept. 17 to hear directly from those who were involved in student-led actions, as well as eyewitnesses, and to learn about the new policies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Numerous speakers from Virginia colleges offered testimony at the two-hour long hearing, including teachers and students arrested in the spring. Jewish students and people affiliated with universities offered perspectives that the demonstrations were important to address injustice. Representatives also said certain SJP chants are offensive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Committee chair Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, a former college professor, encouraged universities to think about uniform policies to approach student activism and faculty rights when it comes to protest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, teaches high school government classes. He questioned if the Senate should be doing anything legislatively concerning college policies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Colleges have two conflicting responsibilities: to uphold free speech and to uphold anti-discrimination, according to VanValkenburg. Colleges need to make sure all kids have a voice and are safe, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At the end of the day this comes down to clear boundaries, clear rules, clarity and objective standards that are followed, no matter what,” VanValkenburg said. “I might like some of those rules, I might not like some of those rules, but they’re the rules.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Older adults age 55 and up accounted for 44% of the homeless population in the Greater Richmond region, according to a recent annual count.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Homelessness in the region increased 20% from <a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/5f4255d0/files/uploaded/July%202023%20PIT%20Infographics%20(5).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://irp.cdn-website.com/5f4255d0/files/uploaded/July%25202023%2520PIT%2520Infographics%2520(5).pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2R5s5pTvOBzX0VvvOUbtjq">2023</a>, while older adult homelessness rose two percentage points, based on recent data collected by the Homeward VA point-in-time <a href="https://www.homewardva.org/point-in-time-count" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.homewardva.org/point-in-time-count&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1YJoePWru4_70bbTL4rhWA">count</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Older adults have vulnerabilities that don&#8217;t exist for other renters or homeowners, according to Benjamin Teresa, the director of <a href="https://rampages.us/rvaevictionlab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rampages.us/rvaevictionlab/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3U92FK2Mt09nBbfvb2voex">RVA Eviction Lab</a>. Limited income, medical costs, rising housing costs, evictions and more can all factor into the displacement of older adults.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like others in the region, older adults face a lack of affordable housing and rising rents, but they have a fixed source of income from Social Security benefits or pensions, Teresa said. They often are unable to have two sources of income to support increased housing costs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> A growing trend is for people to work longer, well into their 60s or 70s, as an effort to afford their cost of living, according to Teresa.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anything such as unexpected medical bills can impact finances and may lead to decisions like forgoing medication to pay rent, or paying medical bills and falling behind on rent, according to Teresa.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of single adults 50 or older who experience homelessness jumped from 11% in the early 1990s to approximately 37% in 2003, according to <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/blog/paint-by-numbers-older-americans-and-homelessness/#:~:text=138%2C098,not%20meant%20for%20human%20habitation" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://endhomelessness.org/blog/paint-by-numbers-older-americans-and-homelessness/%23:~:text%3D138%252C098,not%2520meant%2520for%2520human%2520habitation&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2f6_VHttPDBDLNbCZpQGmJ">an article from the National Alliance to End Homelessness</a>. That percentage then gradually rose to almost 50% in the 2020s.</p>
<p dir="ltr">High property taxes add more burden, Teresa said. Low-income seniors cannot maintain the spike in taxes when a home’s value increases over time, often from neighborhood development and sometimes gentrification.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They even continue to live in unsafe or unhealthy housing conditions because they cannot afford the maintenance. Deteriorating homes are often foreclosed or “predatory investors” buy the home for much less than it&#8217;s worth, which creates housing instability, according to Teresa.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s really important for the city to be investing in affordable housing that would certainly help seniors and help all renters,” Teresa said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Emergency rental assistance was successful during the pandemic but post-pandemic eviction filings have increased as assistance stopped. Good quality and higher paying jobs are crucial to help afford housing costs, according to Teresa.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Housing problems are not just housing problems,” Teresa said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Leading cause of evictions for older adults</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Olivia Seksinsky, a staff attorney at the <a href="https://cvlas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cvlas.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2TSCZgickLOKJTRzE0ceiH">Central Virginia Legal Aid Society, </a>works exclusively for eviction defense. Almost 32% of tenants she represented since 2021 are over the age of 55, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawyers with the organization provide free civil legal services and education to low-income individuals in need, according to its website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The leading cause of eviction for older adults is the lack of affordable housing and landlords “stringency” with a tenant’s rental history records, Seksinsky said. Prior evictions tarnish records and a tenant’s credibility, which can hinder the homing process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Eviction leads to homelessness just because it kind of can close you out of a lot of new housing options,” Seksinsky said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although housing assistance for older adults is available, it is “harder to come by now,” because the need is so widespread, according to Seksinsky.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Older adults may have health concerns, mainly mobility issues, that make it harder to move out before the eviction process starts, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative changes experts say could help</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Seksinsky hoped the failed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB721" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bsum%2BHB721&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Vm1cHN4hoL-hHAqsHDAJf">House Bill 721</a>, which focused on rent control, would pass earlier this year to help deter eviction filings. It was the third time Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, introduced similar legislation to stabilize rent. Lawmakers <a href="https://rvamag.com/politics/rent-control-measures-fail-to-progress-in-legislative-session.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rvamag.com/politics/rent-control-measures-fail-to-progress-in-legislative-session.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0KtNIakb_eykqPQNum2nOp">wanted </a>to see some research or maybe a pilot program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When the landlord has no limit to how often they can raise the rent … the landlord can keep raising the rent,” Seksinsky said. “It eventually becomes impossible to afford unless that senior citizen is then forced to go back to work or borrow money.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A rent cap and more advocacy for public assistance programs will help, specifically with moving costs to transition when affordable housing is needed, Seksinsky said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">LeadingAge Virginia is an association of nonprofits that provide senior housing, assisted living, nursing homes, adult day centers and home and community-based services to older adults, according to its <a href="https://leadingagevirginia.org/page/About" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://leadingagevirginia.org/page/About&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727730020257000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2_Za2cxlxuFR5lfY-c_1Ua">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The association advocates for legislation that improves the affordability and accessibility of high-quality housing for older adults, according to Vice President and Legislative Counsel for LeadingAge Virginia, Dana Parsons.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Its legislative priorities include increasing funding, enacting regulatory reforms to streamline development, and integrating supportive services to ensure full care within these communities, according to Parsons.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Stable housing is key to preserving dignity, improving health outcomes, ensuring economic stability, and fostering strong community support,” Parsons stated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Some elections officers have focused on voter engagement in an effort to counter distrust they believe stems from a lack of education about the process.

<p dir="ltr">Richard Keech is deputy director of elections for Loudoun County, where 224,862 <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/144567/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/144567/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727200847642000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1eUAeX-9172P0ESKRZSMN0">votes </a>were cast for president in the 2020 November election, according to state election results. Keech has worked in elections for 16 years and been in his current position since March 2011, he stated.</p>

The allegations were that the voting machines were not certified and not secure. There was no evidence to substantiate the claims, according to Keech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A lack of voter knowledge about how elections operate has caused anxiety and fear in the general population, according to Keech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There comes a point where we have to tell our story,” Keech said. “We have to tell the truth. We have to be transparent. We have to be up front about what we’re doing to provide safe, secure and efficient elections.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Loudoun officials worked to combat this dynamic and make voters feel confident. Election officials shared more behind the scenes videos, and hosted walk-throughs of their office for the public, according to Loudoun communications manager Samantha Shepherd.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Repeat election volunteers can get specialized training in courses such as technology, help desk training and advance precinct management, according to Keech.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The lack of education around how elections occur is mind boggling to me,” Keech said. “There’s this vision that it’s all occurring on the internet and all these various actors are involved, and the reality is that it’s your friends and your neighbors [who volunteer].”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Citizens are encouraged to ask questions and look at their locality’s website for more information, Keech said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">CITY OF RICHMOND</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Keith Balmer is the general registrar of the City of Richmond, where 111,159 votes were cast for president in the 2020 November election. Virginia has an election every year, so officials are experienced with the procedures, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The way we prepare for this election is really no different than any of the elections,” said Balmer, who has 14 years of experience in this field and three years serving as general registrar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Preparation includes testing, hiring and training &#8212; and more testing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We test a lot of ballots,” Balmer said. “We are talking hundreds, and this election we&#8217;re talking thousands of test ballots to get tested into our machines.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A test election is run with filled-out ballots to certify the machine is counting correctly, Balmer said. This process occurs for every election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any citizens concerned about the validity of the electoral process should volunteer, so they can get a front row seat of the process, Balmer said. Possible positions include pollbook officer, ballot officer and overseeing the voting equipment and booths.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You get to see there&#8217;s so many checks and balances here in place, that you&#8217;re going to walk away convinced that there&#8217;s zero fraud going on around here,” Balmer said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The city will need about 1,200 officers, or about 15 per precinct, according to Balmer. Staffing is important to help avoid long lines and ensure a smooth process, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Getting poll workers has always been challenging because of the long 16 to 18-hour shifts, Balmer said. He pushed for a stipend increase for volunteers, from $120 to $200.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Election officials are focused on the process, not the results, Balmer said. The doubt cast toward election officials in recent years has been “deeply hurtful” and caused people to leave.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">YORK COUNTY</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Walter Latham is the general registrar of York County, where 38,787 votes were cast for president in the 2020 November election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voters have questioned the electoral process since at least 2000, according to Latham. That election, between candidates George W. Bush and Al Gore, resulted in a Florida vote recount that ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court. Latham does think maybe it became “more intense after 2020.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s a public process, the elections belong to the people of the country,” Latham said. “They have a right to have questions and they have a right to have them answered.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Candidate certification deadlines could be set earlier to allow for more time to proof, print and test ballots, he said. The state <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/candidatesandpacs/2024-president-candidate-and-party-docs/2023-11-05-Presidential-Independent-and-Third-Party-Candidates-Bulletin_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/candidatesandpacs/2024-president-candidate-and-party-docs/2023-11-05-Presidential-Independent-and-Third-Party-Candidates-Bulletin_FINAL.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1727200847642000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ReLts-I_FjhlObHVM18k1">deadline </a>for changes for third-party presidential candidates was Sept. 6, two weeks before early voting began.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Standard election preparation includes proofing ballots to ensure all candidate names are spelled correctly and in the correct order, per the Virginia Board of Elections, according to Latham. Then machines are programmed and tested for accuracy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Election officer training is state mandated, with training held in person no more than 30 days before the election and no less than three, according to Latham.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Latham said they are “blessed” to have a good number of volunteers for Election Day, many who are returning to the role.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We try to rely on the ones we have because we appreciate their knowledge and skill and dedication,” Latham said. “Because they work a long day for not a lot of money.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Andreas Addison, 1st District councilman and mayoral candidate, proposed the 2021 <a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5137147&amp;GUID=A4C21C9C-2FB7-4A19-B6CE-5DDAF0A19BA2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID%3D5137147%26GUID%3DA4C21C9C-2FB7-4A19-B6CE-5DDAF0A19BA2&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0tc9hpkVD3EjZjopUTM1cF">resolution</a>. That resolution called on city officials to assess digital infrastructure and develop a strategy to provide Richmond with faster, reliable and affordable internet access. The 2024 <a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6791846&amp;GUID=7A3D4E77-4A39-4BAE-AB85-985C3B881BA5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID%3D6791846%26GUID%3D7A3D4E77-4A39-4BAE-AB85-985C3B881BA5&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2H156SCDPXYQ5qo8tEuO0c">resolution</a>, co-patroned by Addison, calls to develop and implement a plan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have not had an update on that project, and this was really pushing the initiative and saying, ‘where&#8217;s what we asked for in 2021?’” Addison said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pandemic, which pushed students and employees to rely on home internet, highlighted the city’s need for better and more affordable internet. Some students did not have access to high-speed internet, and could not always complete their assignments, according to Addison.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s all kind of rolled into a much bigger conversation around internet access, digital literacy, digital accessibility,” Addison said. “Knowing the internet, how to access it safely and other challenges as well.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The federally funded Affordable Connectivity Program launched in December 2021, to try and address these same issues. The program offered eligible households discounts of up to <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/ACP-FAQs-Post-ACP-Ending.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/ACP-FAQs-Post-ACP-Ending.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw07Zslp9XanfbuaSC-jabId">$30 a month</a> for internet services. The ACP was discontinued this June due to a lack of funding.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Approximately 9.7% of Richmond residents do not have an internet subscription, according to the 2023 American Community Survey one-year <a href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=Richmond%20city,%20Virginia%20internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://data.census.gov/table?q%3DRichmond%2520city,%2520Virginia%2520internet&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2W4rQfzmnG6O-iZwSLIcQA">estimates</a>. Low-income communities are among those affected, unable to access important telehealth, education and workplace opportunities, according to City Council.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Comcast director of government affairs Antoine Banks stated in a letter submitted to the Council that the company <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dA_OrtUBvKs6KNEw4K3ovgjFHKCHOcYA/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dA_OrtUBvKs6KNEw4K3ovgjFHKCHOcYA/view?usp%3Dsharing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0gjge0dNo-ibaVDSoZBjCf">supports </a>equitable access to the internet. The letter asserts there is 100% access to broadband services throughout the city, but the issue is a lack of adoption with programs that reduce service costs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People are not aware of these programs or do not trust them, according to Banks. Comcast has a discounted service <a href="https://www.xfinity.com/learn/internet-service/internet-essentials#:~:text=Internet%20Essentials%20provides%20affordable%20home,hotspots%2C%20and%20free%20Internet%20training.&amp;text=Who%20is%20eligible%20for%20Internet%20Essentials%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.xfinity.com/learn/internet-service/internet-essentials%23:~:text%3DInternet%2520Essentials%2520provides%2520affordable%2520home,hotspots%252C%2520and%2520free%2520Internet%2520training.%26text%3DWho%2520is%2520eligible%2520for%2520Internet%2520Essentials%253F&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1W1eJ9FkzgpeN8--HK4HLp">program </a>for those eligible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Offering affordable or even free internet service alone is not enough to close the digital divide,” Banks stated. “The underlying barriers that prevent people from adopting the technology must also be addressed.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Banks emphasized there needs to be a strong focus on education, digital navigation and effective communication to help people utilize provided resources.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of the Council’s vision is to have a faster, fiber network throughout the city. Broadband allows users to connect to the internet, and different services offer varying speeds. Fiber-optic technology transmits data at a faster speed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What is the roadmap of our opportunity to truly put fiber where it&#8217;s needed?” Addison said. “So that it’s not just broadband access, which is relatively slow and doesn&#8217;t have a lot of good bandwidth for really complicated uses.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Price is another factor in fiber’s favor, aside from initial infrastructure costs. Addison said some city residents pay the same for broadband that he pays for high-speed fiber internet.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> &#8220;They&#8217;re paying $65 a month for broadband; same fee I am paying for fiber,&#8221; Addison said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Market failures have left low-income communities without equal access, according to City Council.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That&#8217;s the challenge I want to tackle, is it should not be market driven on how we bring internet connectivity to neighborhoods,” Addison said. “And right now it is.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401205A2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401205A2.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YqEQ5wXP-tbG27NYFff6A">increased </a>the broadband baseline standard to download speeds of at least 100 megabytes per second and upload speeds of at least 20 mbps earlier this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond’s median internet speed is on the slower side, according to the industry publication <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/best-internet-providers-in-richmond-va/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnet.com/home/internet/best-internet-providers-in-richmond-va/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726617175690000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3FFsxIAisesA71g22OZZd6">CNET</a>. The city was ranked 86th of the 100 most populous cities, based on data from the broadband speed test application Ookla.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The average download speed in Richmond clocked at 185 mbps and an upload speed of 51 mbps upload speed, which is higher than the FCC baseline.</p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. &#8212; Karlee Clements was six months pregnant, “full on into addiction” and begging to go to jail because she was afraid she would kill her child.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Soon after, she was incarcerated at Riverside Regional Jail for a violation. Because of her baby’s low heart rate, she was sent to Chippenham Hospital, where she spent the remainder of her pregnancy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Zip-tied to a hospital bed, with a Riverside officer next to her, Clements gave birth to a baby girl and spent three days with her, per <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title53.1/chapter2/article2.2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title53.1/chapter2/article2.2/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2wZzGlg_O38v3I_h2zdX9c">Virginia law</a>.

<p dir="ltr">Clements went back to jail, and her baby experienced withdrawal for 30 days. Once she was released, Clements gave her baby up for adoption and started using drugs again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It became a way of living,” Clements said. “That’s the way I got through life.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">She went to rehab, stopped using heroin, but began using methadone, a synthetic opioid often prescribed as part of recovery treatment and to combat withdrawal symptoms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Even though I love that baby, and I don’t want to hurt that baby, there’s just something inside of me where I can’t stop using,” Clements said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of jailed pregnant women fighting addiction has increased amid the skyrocketing opioid use in the past decade that led Virginia to <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/commissioner/declaration-of-public-health-emergency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/commissioner/declaration-of-public-health-emergency/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Bk7tfBaphvGmOddAnqlhw">declare</a> a public health emergency in 2016. While the state has started to fund more recovery and treatment efforts, incarcerated mothers have fewer resources. Women in jail say facing motherhood and addiction is a specific struggle that needs more attention, in addition to more uniform prenatal care.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is no official census of how many pregnant women are incarcerated, or their overall maternal health, a data gap the U.S. Department of Justice <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/dmhpopj.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://bjs.ojp.gov/document/dmhpopj.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1bC7RKcLBSEXRZ4TB-3EZ5">acknowledges</a> and is addressing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Approximately 3% of women admitted to U.S. jails are pregnant, according to a 2020 peer-reviewed study published in the Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology journal. If that number was applied to the national jail population, there could be an estimated <a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/2020/05000/pregnancy_prevalence_and_outcomes_in_u_s__jails.24.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/abstract/2020/05000/pregnancy_prevalence_and_outcomes_in_u_s__jails.24.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0AY5BMpowbGWSuWiEa1PTY">55,000</a> pregnant women in jail.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I’m actually learning to love myself, and my feelings are coming back,” Clements said. “It’s okay to feel, I’m not used to feeling at all.”</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Finding Recovery Behind Bars</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Chesterfield County Sheriff Karl Leonard started the HARP program after annual overdose deaths in the county hit double digits on March 8, 2016.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People would get clean and sober in jail and then go back to the community. In reality, nothing was being done to help them, Leonard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We wanted to start releasing recovered addicts back into the community with the tools, the knowledge, the equipment to be able to deal with all those issues that led them to use drugs before they got into the jail,” Leonard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">HARP currently does not offer programs geared towards pregnant women, but does offer parenting classes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chesterfield jail does not provide prenatal care, so pregnant inmates are sent to Riverside in Prince George County. Riverside had 475 pregnant inmates in a little over eight years, according to the jail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">HARP predates the Opioid Abatement Authority, an organization created by the General Assembly in 2021 to handle incoming opioid lawsuit settlement money. Virginia is beginning to receive millions of what will be an estimated $1.1 billion, according to the OAA.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“One of the rules for the use of the funds, which we disagree with very much, is that the funds cannot be used for any existing programs,” Leonard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A locality <a href="https://www.oaa.virginia.gov/about/#:~:text=Cities%20and%20counties%20can%20expand,no%20indirect%20costs%20are%20allowed.&amp;text=Each%20city%20and%20county%20in,accordance%20with%20the%20statewide%20MOU." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oaa.virginia.gov/about/%23:~:text%3DCities%2520and%2520counties%2520can%2520expand,no%2520indirect%2520costs%2520are%2520allowed.%26text%3DEach%2520city%2520and%2520county%2520in,accordance%2520with%2520the%2520statewide%2520MOU.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ITJN7ZZy_h6hjmExC0glU">cannot</a> use OAA money to supplant existing expenditures but can receive funding if they expand existing programs or implement new programs, according to its website.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Support for Incarcerated Pregnant Women</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Many women do not even know they are pregnant when they enter jail, according to Henrico County West Jail Capt. Pamela Dismuke. Female inmates are <a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/files/operating-procedures/700/vadoc-op-720-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vadoc.virginia.gov/files/operating-procedures/700/vadoc-op-720-2.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0AYL_wVgWdVATkZsnXq4Yp">required</a> to take a pregnancy test when they enter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I like to say a lot of the time jail kinda saved them, because had she not known she was pregnant she’d probably still be doing drugs and hurting the baby even more,” Dismuke said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dismuke started a program for pregnant inmates two years ago. She contacted someone who works for the Department of Corrections and is a doula, or a person who provides guidance and support to a pregnant woman during labor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Incarcerated pregnant women need specific food, supplements, exercise and even postpartum help that is not common practice throughout the system.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Special: The VA opioid epidemic and how services are helping incarcerated mothers" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lGZ5DciPJE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">The nonprofit Virginia Prison Birth Project pairs pregnant women in the Henrico jail with a doula and also shares nutritional food and information on a baby’s development and care, in addition to a weekly yoga class. Doulas also offer support by delivering breastmilk to the baby’s caretaker.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The organization provided the first doula-supported birth for a pregnant inmate in Virginia in 2019, according to its <a href="https://virginiaprisonbirthproject.org/what-we-do#:~:text=In%202019%20we%20provided%20the,have%20an%20established%20referral%20system." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginiaprisonbirthproject.org/what-we-do%23:~:text%3DIn%25202019%2520we%2520provided%2520the,have%2520an%2520established%2520referral%2520system.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DjXg7BTgOImsLnsDqb_ff">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many women learn through the program how drugs hurt their babies, and it helps them take better care of themselves, Dismuke said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bobbie Jo Lashway, a pregnant inmate at Henrico County West Jail, said there are few programs aimed at her subgroup, despite large numbers of incarcerated pregnant women.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lashway enjoys the yoga program and is thankful people take time out of their day to share experiences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s good on a human connection level that we don’t get in here,” Lashway said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding Efforts to Combat the Epidemic</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The OAA <a href="https://www.oaa.virginia.gov/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oaa.virginia.gov/about/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1dv6wXSm6PwH9eEU49W2kL">distributes</a> 55% of incoming settlement funds to state agencies and localities that apply for funding, according to OAA director of finance Adam Rosatelli. A grants committee decides how to distribute the funds, in line with opioid abatement efforts and <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/authorities/opioid-abatement-authority/#:~:text=%C2%A7%202.2%2D2366.&amp;text=The%20purpose%20of%20the%20Authority,of%20opioids%20in%20the%20Commonwealth." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/authorities/opioid-abatement-authority/%23:~:text%3D%25C2%25A7%25202.2%252D2366.%26text%3DThe%2520purpose%2520of%2520the%2520Authority,of%2520opioids%2520in%2520the%2520Commonwealth.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw22WB8C1OLayllGM6QXOYkw">Virginia code</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The OAA has not funded any programs related to incarcerated pregnant or parenting women, but has funded jail programs, according to Rosatelli.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was a pretty powerful thing to observe about the work we do and it being put into action,” Rosatelli said, about a visit last year to an OAA-funded recovery center for women in Washington County.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The OAA has distributed about $34 million, which has been used for initiatives such as recovery homes, education and prevention efforts and marketing campaigns, according to Rosatelli.</p>

<p dir="ltr"> Neglect is the leading cause of a child’s removal from their home, followed by parental drug abuse.

<p dir="ltr"> Over 1,600 kids were in foster care for this reason as of April 2024, according to VDSS <a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/geninfo/reports/children/fc.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dss.virginia.gov/geninfo/reports/children/fc.cgi&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1714647947920000&amp;usg=AOvVaw24dpmtUuaNIj1TDbLKd3Jf">data</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Clements has traveled a long road since she first stole pain pills from her mother. Now, she works through HARP to confront and heal the trauma that pushed her toward substance use. The program is helping her build back her self-esteem to face continued challenges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is literally the first time I’ve ever even said that story, but I’m able to say that without crying and feeling bad and feeling like it is my fault,” Clements said.</p>

(Meghan McIntyre/Virginia Mercury)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Shelby Warren / Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Legislation to educate consumers on invasive plant species passed in the General Assembly, but not without debate over where signage would be placed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Invasive plant species are not native to the region and can negatively impact ecosystems. The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation has identified 90 invasive plant <a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/natural-heritage/document/nh-invasive-plant-list-2023.pdf" target="_blank">species</a>, by rank of most to least invasive. Species on the list include kudzu, English ivy, golden bamboo and periwinkle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Saddam Salim, D-Fairfax, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB306" target="_blank">Senate Bill 306 and Del. Holly Seibold, D-Fairfax, introduced </a><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB47#:~:text=SUMMARY%20AS%20INTRODUCED%3A&amp;text=Requires%2C%20for%20the%20retail%20sale,with%20caution%3A%20invasive%20plant%20species." target="_blank">House Bill 47</a>. Lawmakers at the end of the legislative session smoothed out the differences between the bills and passed a final proposal.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="g1iqs1spBC"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/04/state-group-says-virginia-should-budget-more-for-invasive-species-management/">State group says Virginia should budget more for invasive species management</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;State group says Virginia should budget more for invasive species management&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/04/state-group-says-virginia-should-budget-more-for-invasive-species-management/embed/#?secret=msMjKSrOMG#?secret=g1iqs1spBC" data-secret="g1iqs1spBC" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers were divided on whether the signage should be at each invasive plant display or at an entrance. The Senate amended both bills to place signage at entrances, but the House rejected the amendment. The original House bill also wanted language at each display that stated: plant with caution, could cause environmental harm and ask about alternatives.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The final bill passed will require any place that sells an invasive plant species to display a sign nearby that warns consumers and encourages them to ask about alternatives. There is a penalty of no more than $500 for retailers who fail to post the signs and a stop sale order until the signage is posted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We can’t stop invasive plants all 100% but making it aware to individuals who are purchasing is a step forward,” Salim said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Services will determine the format, size and signage content by October. The signage will have a QR code that links to the Department of Conservation and Recreation’s invasive species <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-104.6:2/" target="_blank">list</a> that is updated every four years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The sign is expected to be black and yellow for optimal visibility, according to Salim.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Invasive species have cost Virginia as much as $1 billion <a href="https://www.invasivespeciesva.org/about" target="_blank">annually</a>, according to the Virginia Invasive Species website. This total exceeds $120 billion nationally.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Current state code prohibits state agencies from planting, selling or propagating any listed invasive plant, unless necessary for “scientific or educational purposes or bona fide agricultural purposes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pat Calvert, director of clean water and land conservation at Virginia Conservation Network, supports labeling invasive plants. He sees the legislation as an opportunity to educate consumers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This also creates a responsibility for retailers to be transparent in what they are selling, Calvert said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Calvert has dealt with pesky English ivy on his property, which, like other invasive plants, spreads quickly through seeding and roots.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “It’s just really, really tough to get rid of,” Calvert said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The plants can damage an ecosystem or agriculture. The Southeast Asian tree of heaven is a primary food source for the spotted lanternfly, which has expanded its territory, according to Calvert. The flies damage crops.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The management of these plants is problematic and costly for individuals, localities, parks and farmers, Calvert said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Friends of the James River Park System in early March hosted Invasive Species <a href="https://jamesriverpark.org/invasive-species-awareness-week-protecting-our-ecosystems-preserving-our-future/" target="_blank">Awareness</a>Week. The program educated people on invasive plants through activities like plant removal, nature walks and more. The organization has hosted this awareness event since 2015.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The James River Park System has over 50 invasive plant species that threaten trees, water and soil quality, and also native bugs, birds and flowers, the <a href="https://jamesriverpark.org/invasive-species-awareness-week-protecting-our-ecosystems-preserving-our-future/" target="_blank">organization</a> stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers recently approved a <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/amendmentpdf/4922/" target="_blank">budget</a> that distributes several million dollars across departments to help meet initiatives outlined by the Virginia Invasive Species Management <a href="https://www.invasivespeciesva.org/publications" target="_blank">Plan</a>, and which includes the hiring of new employees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The governor is currently reviewing the budget and legislation. The General Assembly will reconvene on April 17 to consider any of his proposed changes.</p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By <span class="tnt-byline">Emily Richardson/Capital News Service</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Gov. Glenn Youngkin recently vetoed two bills that would have allowed Virginia to rejoin a national organization that helps maintain voter rolls.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The nonpartisan <a href="https://ericstates.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="3">Election Registration Information Center</a>, or ERIC, ensures up-to-date voter rolls and helps voters register when they move, according to Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico. Virginia was a founding member of ERIC in 2012 under the direction of former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia withdrew from ERIC in May 2023, citing other states departing and “increasing concerns regarding stewardship, maintenance, privacy and confidentiality of voter information,” among other reasons, according to a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23810805/file_0097-2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="4">letter from the commissioner</a> of the Virginia Department of Elections. Nine states had left ERIC by October 2023, according to VanValkenburg.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VanValkenburg introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="5">Senate Bill 606</a> to require state membership in ERIC and a budget amendment to cover membership fees. Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, introduced an <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="6">identical measure</a>. Democrats narrowly pushed the proposals past both chambers, where they hold a slim majority.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The vetoes come at a time when election methods and voting-related policy are being questioned by state legislatures <a href="https://news.wgcu.org/elections/2024-03-05/new-laws-across-states-will-affect-voting-in-november-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="7">across the country</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Objectively, ERIC is the best way to maintain up-to-date voter rolls,” VanValkenburg said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He expressed <a href="https://twitter.com/ScVanValkenburg/status/1766504572409815295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="8">disappointment</a> with the veto and the governor’s “continued insistence on playing politics with our election security” ahead of the 2024 election on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is deeply troubling for our democracy when our Governor and Virginia Republicans compromise the security of our elections and our ability to maintain accurate voter lists in an attempt to satiate the most extreme, MAGA-wing of their party,” VanValkenburg stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VanValkenburg said he thought the governor might <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/Vetoes-(1).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="9">veto</a> his bill. The state budget has $200,000 allotted to cover the membership cost, which the General Assembly passed in its final <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/amendmentpdf/4922/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="10">version</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Department of Elections could use ERIC in tandem with other services, Sickles <a href="https://twitter.com/ScVanValkenburg/status/1766504572409815295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="11">stated</a>. He also pointed out that the department previously praised ERIC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Nothing changed in the ERIC states to reduce its effectiveness or quality,” Sickles stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/maintenance-reports/2022-List-Maintenance-Report_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="12">2022 list maintenance report</a> by the Virginia Department of Elections states that participation in ERIC “streamlined” Virginia’s cooperation with other states in the sharing of voter registration data.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/maintenance-reports/2023-List-Maintenance-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="13">2023 report</a> briefly mentions ERIC but focused on how the department now works to confirm state voter data, including felony convictions that prevent a person from voting. The new approach yielded <a href="https://spanberger.house.gov/posts/spanberger-joins-virginia-democrats-in-once-again-pushing-doj-to-investigate-youngkin-administrations-purging-of-voter-rolls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="14">criticism </a>after 3,400 qualified voters were purged from the list.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia signed <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/news-releases/virginia-signs-agreements-with-six-states-as-part-of-improvements-to-accuracy-of-voter-list.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="15">agreements</a> with six nearby states last September to share data and “securely compare voter lists and identify potential voter fraud.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">At present, 24 states and the District of Columbia are ERIC members. There was a recent exodus of Republican-led member states fueled by “right-wing misinformation,” according to VanValkenburg.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia&#8217;s decision to leave ERIC was a result of “persistent management issues, improper data use, escalating costs and the inability to meet statutory requirements for border state information sharing,” the governor stated in his <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/Vetoes-(1).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-linkindex="16">veto</a> of SB 606.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia attempted to reform the organization’s bylaws before leaving, according to Youngkin’s spokesperson Christian Martinez.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Virginia decided to diversify its list maintenance efforts, successfully sought direct access to state and federal data sources and increased the number of states from where we receive data,” Martinez stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These current agreements incur no additional costs, according to the veto, which also states that ERIC membership fees have increased more than 115% since 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Election law became a partisan issue as a result of misinformation former President Donald Trump and other election deniers spread about ERIC and election administration, VanValkenburg said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think ERIC got caught up in the big lie of the 2020 election, and unfortunately that’s filtered its way down to the votes on rejoining,” VanValkenburg said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is important for the legislature to make secure and accessible elections a bipartisan priority, VanValkenburg said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That’s something that I’ve worked on, and Democrats have worked on since I’ve been in the General Assembly,” VanValkenburg said. “It’s unfortunate that we didn’t get bipartisan support.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers unanimously supported a resolution that encouraged Virginians to “ponder the cosmic eons beyond” and consider the impact of increased light pollution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued a <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/proclamations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/proclamations/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709914832964000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1qkBfg2C57d3jwRETZqP0_">proclamation </a> the past two years in observance of the week, but it will now have official designation and be placed on the General Assembly website.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> The resolution sheds light on a dark sky movement that values darkness to appreciate “the beauty of the night sky above” and explores solutions to minimize light pollution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This first part is about awareness,” Reid said, with hopes people will think about the kinds of lighting used in their homes or businesses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reid was inspired by an avid photographer friend to present the resolution to the General Assembly, in addition to his own self-described amateur forays into astronomy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s again, awe inspiring when you can look through the telescope and see these things with your own eyes,” Reid said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He hopes that clearer night skies may encourage children to engage with science, technology and engineering programs at a young age.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The DarkSky International organization <a href="https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709914832964000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0G_DvCy4GItFbUwpbHHn0_">defines</a> light pollution as the human-made alteration of natural levels of light. This can occur from the harsh exterior lighting of buildings, parking lots and street lamps.</p>

	<div class="newsroomSidebar">International Dark Sky Week will occur from April 2-8 this year, <a href="https://idsw.darksky.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://idsw.darksky.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709914832964000&amp;usg=AOvVaw29lGWayVoNjkOY7qkS8MbL">according</a> to DarkSky. </div>

<p dir="ltr">Light pollution harms migratory birds and other local wildlife in addition to blocking out the night sky, according to the <a href="https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/effects/wildlife-ecosystems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://darksky.org/resources/what-is-light-pollution/effects/wildlife-ecosystems/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709914832964000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MOPI4GCPFVr0g1tdoVJbI">organization</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The annual cost of wasted energy in the U.S. is estimated to be roughly $3 billion, according to the resolution and previous proclamations from the governor’s office.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The first lighting ordinance was passed in Arizona in 1958. The DarkSky organization began advocacy in 1988 to educate and preserve starry views throughout the world, according to its <a href="https://darksky.org/about/success-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://darksky.org/about/success-stories/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709914832964000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1z0j-JJsIwp-Vgcfxf7Yeh">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The history of Dark Sky Week is rooted in a Virginia suburb and North Carolina beach. Midlothian native Jennifer Barlow realized as a teen that her view of the stars was not the same in her backyard as it was at the beach, according to a University of Virginia <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-student-founds-promotes-national-dark-sky-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-student-founds-promotes-national-dark-sky-week&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709914832964000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Z8i9R7PcP0A81s6pRHfGG">profile</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Barlow’s mission to “spread the wonders of the skies in their full beauty” reached a worldwide audience and became the inspiration for International Dark Sky Week, she <a href="https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-resources/jennifer-barlow-dark-sky-devotee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-resources/jennifer-barlow-dark-sky-devotee/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709914832964000&amp;usg=AOvVaw08gZ2qRpwob5VCrMyahY7X">told</a> Sky and Telescope in 2006.</p>

This means that these parks follow strict lighting ordinances to prevent light pollution and obscuration of the night sky.</p>
<p dir="ltr">George Spagna is the former director of Randolph-Macon College’s Keeble Observatory and former mayor of Ashland, a town about 20 miles north of Richmond.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have grown into a nation of people who are afraid of the dark,” Spagna said. “The problem with being afraid of the dark is you can’t see the wonders of the universe around you.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Randolph-Macon College has offered astronomy courses since their relocation to Ashland in 1868. Star-gazing classes were on the catalog as early as 1872, according to Spagna.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spagna worked with Ashland to meet light pollution standards established by the International Dark Sky Association. He explained that lighting can often be an afterthought for developers, and an official Dark Sky week could help make the public more cognizant of light pollution.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Chapel Hill Astronomical and Observational Society hosts the biannual Staunton River Star Party at the park, with the <a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/event?id=2023-11-07-18-16-08-920226-kon" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/event?id%3D2023-11-07-18-16-08-920226-kon&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709914832964000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PtRSr99mJwfTES5TS_WWD">spring event</a> held this year March 4-10.

<p dir="ltr">Public day for the star party will be held March 8, from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m, for those who wish to observe the “transitive nightfall of diamonds.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">The state legislature, 56 years later, was called on to address multiple instances of unethical use of Black bodies by medical institutions in Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, introduced the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+cab+SC10129SJ0016+UCSJ1#:~:text=SJ%2016%20Unethical%20use%20of,institutions%3B%20acknowledging%20with%20profound%20regret." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bcab%2BSC10129SJ0016%2BUCSJ1%23:~:text%3DSJ%252016%2520Unethical%2520use%2520of,institutions%253B%2520acknowledging%2520with%2520profound%2520regret.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709677365841000&amp;usg=AOvVaw32yPCyWjAd6CEbsDEM2rAn">resolution</a> to acknowledge such practice with “profound regret.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The resolution unanimously passed the Senate and House. Boysko filed the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ274" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231%2Bsum%2BSJ274&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709677365841000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2X1iqdRl1gq9tboiZHN0sC">resolution</a> last year, but the Republican-led House Rules Committee never advanced it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The resolution “was not given a true hearing in the House of Delegates last year,” Boysko said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This year looks promising for a different outcome due to a change in leadership, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The people who are leading today have a different perspective and a commitment to trying to make Virginia an equitable and safe place for everyone,” Boysko said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gayle Turner, a family representative of the Tucker family, described her second cousin as a “hidden figure in medical science.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He worked at the same place for more than 20 years … and he had filed for civil service in World War II,” Turner said. “He was willing to fight for his country and he loved his country and family.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tucker’s brother, William Tucker, filed a lawsuit against the surgeons in 1968. The case ended in 1972 with a ruling in favor of the doctors, according to <a href="https://www.organdonationalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tucker-v.-Lower-1-Va.-Cir.-124-1972.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.organdonationalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tucker-v.-Lower-1-Va.-Cir.-124-1972.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709677365841000&amp;usg=AOvVaw29CYc3vE8XsWTYZgZM81ME">court documents</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Phillip Thompson, former Loudoun County NAACP president, was “astounded” by Tucker’s story and brought the issue to Boysko last year, he said to Senate committee members.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Tucker family expressed appreciation to Boysko and Thompson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are pleased that Virginia is poised to recognize, realize and apologize for past wrongs to assure they never happen again,” the Tucker family stated in an email. “We pray that the full House affirms this resolution.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Without ‘The Organ Thieves’ and without asking for the apology, I&#8217;m not sure if VCU would have apologized, because the way they apologized was so shallow and hollow,” Turner said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU released a public apology <a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2022/09/resolution-of-the-vcu-bov-and-the-board-of-directors-of-vcu-health-system-authority#:~:text=NOW%2C%20THEREFORE%2C%20BE%20IT%20RESOLVED,his%20heart%2054%20years%20ago." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.vcu.edu/article/2022/09/resolution-of-the-vcu-bov-and-the-board-of-directors-of-vcu-health-system-authority%23:~:text%3DNOW%252C%2520THEREFORE%252C%2520BE%2520IT%2520RESOLVED,his%2520heart%252054%2520years%2520ago.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709677365841000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0eLqQU3BoMgLcRSM6FTHMn">statement</a> in September 2022 and sent a letter to the Tucker family in September 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The university selected “The Organ Thieves” as its <a href="https://commonbook.vcu.edu/the-2022-common-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://commonbook.vcu.edu/the-2022-common-book/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709677365841000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0jvS5GPruFUAlTJZ3mdpkf">Common Book</a> in 2022. The book was required reading for all first-year students and was discussed at events open to the community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jones discovered the story while working at the <a href="https://www.ramdocs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ramdocs.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709677365841000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2nQSVP0wT_ZD-LN0KB07o9">Richmond Academy of Medicine</a>, the state’s oldest and largest medical society. He was informed of plans for an event in 2018 to honor the 50th anniversary of the state&#8217;s first human heart transplant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As a former reporter, my antenna kind of went up,” Jones said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most important aspect of his work was the possibility of closure for Tucker’s family, according to Jones.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Bruce was a good man, a good person,” Turner said. “He deserved better.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Tucker family hopes the legislation will motivate VCU to lead by example on the nationwide issue of providing justice for the medical misuse of Black bodies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Construction workers discovered an MCV well that contained the human remains of at least 53 individuals in 1994, according to the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+cab+SC10129SJ0016+UCSJ1#:~:text=SJ%2016%20Unethical%20use%20of,institutions%3B%20acknowledging%20with%20profound%20regret." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bcab%2BSC10129SJ0016%2BUCSJ1%23:~:text%3DSJ%252016%2520Unethical%2520use%2520of,institutions%253B%2520acknowledging%2520with%2520profound%2520regret.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709677365841000&amp;usg=AOvVaw32yPCyWjAd6CEbsDEM2rAn">resolution</a>. A majority of the discarded remains were African or of African descent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shawn Utsey, who holds a doctorate in counseling psychology, is currently serving his <a href="https://psychology.vcu.edu/news/newsroom/psychology-news/shawn-utsey-appointed-acting-chair-of-african-american-studies.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://psychology.vcu.edu/news/newsroom/psychology-news/shawn-utsey-appointed-acting-chair-of-african-american-studies.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709677365841000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Rpkw9bvh2a_gr_ukJ4VhQ">third term</a> as chair of the Department of African American Studies at VCU.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The reason that VCU is able to be a leader is because they had an advantage that began in the 1800s,” Utsey said. “That advantage was access to Black bodies.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Medical students and staff in Richmond employed grave robbers to perform dissections in the 1800s, according to the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SJ16" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bful%2BSJ16&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709677365841000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2AqOiL7l3BKUTTjImtyXcI">measure</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At least 53 bodies were “callously and disrespectfully” discarded into the well afterward, according to <a href="https://emsw.vcu.edu/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://emsw.vcu.edu/about/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709677365841000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1WqxwP_n0TiTFvRaqdbCRN">VCU</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU’s Archaeological Research Center sent the remains to the Smithsonian Institution for investigation in 1994. The excavated contents were ultimately placed in storage without funding from VCU.</p>

(Courtesy of Ryan Carpenter/VCU Capital News Service)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Ryan Carpenter / Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">State lawmakers struck out again with a proposal to allow betting on Virginia college sports teams.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia law since 2021 has allowed sports betting through casinos and online sports books like FanDuel and BetMGM, with the exception of wagers on state youth and college sports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some legislators have gone to bat to change the law. Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, sponsored <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB124" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bsum%2BSB124&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709081796468000&amp;usg=AOvVaw21nCjEnS1ht27u6LEmAOP5">Senate Bill 124</a> this session, his second attempt to get the law off the bench. He introduced a similar measure in 2022 as a delegate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His bill had committee support this year but was continued to 2025 once it hit the Senate money committee. There was no <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+oth+SB124F122+PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Both%2BSB124F122%2BPDF&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709081796468000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1H-jx0qSi1sTfX891uzHRh">associated</a> fiscal cost to the state.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The legislation could help eliminate illegal betting in Virginia and would create consistency, VanValkenburg said during the bill’s committee hearing. The change would bring in tax dollars for the state but also make it safer for bettors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even the small amount of extra games added by the bill could contribute to state coffers, according to Brendan Dwyer, director of research and distance learning at Virginia Commonwealth University’s Center for Sports Leadership. Casual bettors are really where the sports books make their money, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A Virginia college sports team fan would have a chance to turn something they are already invested in into a cash gain, according to Dwyer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“How casual bettors view betting is when they watch games, they want additional action,” Dwyer said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But there is concern over the impact on <a href="https://emporianews.com/tags/mario-navarro" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://emporianews.com/tags/mario-navarro&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709081796468000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pvcV1WGzYrNnz-_UqNE5W">younger</a> demographics as online sports betting becomes more popular.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Males ages 18 to 24 are most at risk because of their “inability to regulate their decision-making,” Dwyer said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is also concern about how athletic departments, coaches and student athletes may experience unintended consequences if the state legalizes college sports betting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is only a very slight risk that players would make bets on their own sporting events, Dwyer said. NCAA <a href="https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2016/4/29/sports-wagering.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncaa.org/sports/2016/4/29/sports-wagering.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709081796468000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0rcngKsk3bKJpwqB9CbZ1-">bylaws</a> prohibit coaches or players from betting on college sports.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There have been instances in the past year in which players and coaches have gotten in trouble for sports betting. Most prominent was the firing of the University of Alabama’s head baseball coach, Brad Bohannon, following a <a href="https://www.si.com/college/2023/07/10/inside-the-alabama-baseball-gambling-scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.si.com/college/2023/07/10/inside-the-alabama-baseball-gambling-scandal&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1709081796468000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2otKyNaVsL8Qnn49NSPigN">gambling scandal</a> in which he passed information to someone placing a large bet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cam Lane is a first-year assistant baseball coach at the University of Lynchburg. He believes violations would be a bigger possibility at a larger, Division I program and not as much of a concern at the Division III university.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think the effects at Lynchburg would be somewhat minimal,” Lane said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The biggest problem could be bettors promising athletes large amounts of money to sway the game in a certain favor, Lane said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Who’s to say someone who is a million-dollar sports bettor wouldn’t offer my starting pitcher a million dollars to throw a game?” Lane said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jason Wade is a guard for the Old Dominion University basketball team. It is his sixth year with the program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This year was probably the most it has been talked about,” Wade said. “Coaches set us down at the beginning … and they tell us it’s against NCAA regulations to bet on any type of sports where you can get paid or get benefits from.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sports betting could put the spotlight and pressure on Virginia teams in a different way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A bettor confronted Wade and his team after they lost in the second round of their conference tournament last season because he had a prop bet on an ODU player that he could not cash out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That was really the only in-person altercation that I have seen,” Wade said. “Of course, I’ve seen stuff on Twitter and Instagram of people, like, coming at athletes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Player safety might be a bigger concern if more people start betting on college sports, according to Wade. Student-athletes are more accessible than professional athletes, so there is a larger risk of confrontations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We travel commercially, so a lot of people see us, they recognize us,” Wade said. “If they’re placing sports bets on us, we don’t have security around us … so they can easily come up and threaten you or confront you about them losing money because of you.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">State lawmakers have advanced bills that would allow public sector employees to use medical cannabis without losing their job.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB149" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bsum%2BHB149&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708190708984000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3gwCVWq7_v1MX-_-EUzsGn">House Bill 149</a>, introduced by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, extends to state public employees rights that already exist in the private sector. The bill passed with bipartisan support on a 78-20 vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Helmer sponsored <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB1862" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212%2Bsum%2BHB1862&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708190708984000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1FoMrbR42plqgIE9-l4XZq">HB 1862</a> three years ago to protect patients approved for medical cannabis use. That bill “unintentionally did not protect public sector employees,” Helmer said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The key was we left our brave first responders out of this,” Helmer said. “That was never our intent and so this bill is meant to fix that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"> A cannabis product is anything from CBD up to 10 milligrams of THC per dose, the current <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/4.1-1600/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/4.1-1600/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708190708984000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3w476UxSCRibqfZrmOGv7U">state </a>cap, as long as the product is produced, sold and tested through the medical cannabis program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Public sector employees such as firefighters, police officers and teachers are among the groups that would be protected under Helmer’s bill if they are approved to use cannabis products to treat conditions or diseases.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB391" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bsum%2BSB391&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708190708984000&amp;usg=AOvVaw05PHFI7R3bG1iSNcsWaKje">Senate Bill 391</a>, introduced by Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax, also offers protection to public sector employees, with the exception of law enforcement officers. The bill passed the Senate with a 30-10 vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Peksarsky’s bill uses language that extends protection for use of cannabis oil.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Helmer’s bill was amended from “cannabis oil” to “cannabis products,” which he said is meant to “refer to a slew of medically recommended products that have cannabis as the basis.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Any increase in inquiries or modifications to existing policies would be absorbed within existing resources by the Department of Labor and Industry or Department of Human Resource Management, respectively, according to the bill’s impact statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Joe Mirabile, a representative of Virginia&#8217;s Professional Firefighters, testified in support of Helmer&#8217;s bill during its committee hearing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“My members have reported that they’re relying on alcohol far less, they’re sleeping more at home and they’re seeing other positive effects, such as reduction of joint and muscle pain without having to use opioid prescriptions,” Mirabile said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The only legal way that a person can purchase cannabis in the state is through the medical cannabis program. Approved state practitioners can issue a certification after an initial consultation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dawn Adams, a nurse practitioner and former state delegate who represented the Richmond area, operates a medical cannabis practitioner clinic. Cannabis products are often used to help with PTSD, anxiety and sleep problems that are associated with the employee’s role, according to Adams.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over-the-counter and prescription drugs, along with alcohol, can sometimes have lingering effects compared to an appropriate dose of short-acting cannabis medication, Adams said. But that has been the only option for many workers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Many of these people have had to jump through a thousand hoops to even be considered to use medical cannabis,” Adams said. “When in fact, it would be a pretty decent alternative to many of the health determinants that are associated with their life.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Employers would still be able to prohibit use of cannabis on the job and take action against any employee whose work is impaired because of cannabis use. The proposed bill does not make any changes to the current <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/40.1-27.4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/40.1-27.4/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708190708984000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1CZz11vkPtdaniQs7OgS7x">law</a> in regards to federal workers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is no widely available rapid test to nail down the window of cannabis use to determine if an employee was impaired at work. Researchers at Virginia Commonwealth University are working on a THC <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/22/vcu-professor-develops-thc-breathalyzer-to-help-detect-driver-impairment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/22/vcu-professor-develops-thc-breathalyzer-to-help-detect-driver-impairment/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708190708984000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0goYzQpINmQzHa9GPgJbtI">breathalyzer</a> to help law enforcement detect cannabis impairment and distinguish between THC and CBD use.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chelsea Higgs Wise is the executive director of the advocacy group <a href="https://www.marijuanajustice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.marijuanajustice.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708190708984000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1qsQtIdzPgFdf32Vnn6hm_">Marijuana Justice</a>, which is focused on helping the state create an equitable recreational cannabis marketplace.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“State employees should be allowed to access cannabis in their off-work time,” Higgs Wise said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The group supports Helmer’s bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “We understand the nuances that public employees are navigating and are excited to offer our support for this extension of wellness to our employees of the commonwealth,” Higgs Wise stated in the organization&#8217;s letter of support to Helmer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are approximately <a href="https://patients.va.biotr.ac/?action=enrolled_mp" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://patients.va.biotr.ac/?action%3Denrolled_mp&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1708190708984000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0UTonps0Uq5DZ5NSUqH_fO">1,000</a> approved medical cannabis practitioners in Virginia. A total of 98,396 patients used their written certification in 2023 to receive medical cannabis through the state program, according to the managing agency Cannabis Control Authority.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both bills now advance to the other chamber.</p>

<p dir="ltr">State lawmakers did not advance legislation this session that aimed to slow rising rent prices, although affordable housing remains a big concern for constituents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Two proposed bills would have allowed localities to adopt anti-rent gouging provisions, prevent landlords from increasing rent without at least two-month notice, and set an annual allowance between <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+HB721AHC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bamd%2BHB721AHC&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531399000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2SlX7P5N7kBKPoOlEGXx8S">7% and 15%</a> for rent increases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB366" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bsum%2BSB366&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531399000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Nztv6xxLuytaahySEuapR">Senate Bill 366</a>, which is dead after it was defeated in committee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB721" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bsum%2BHB721&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531399000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2q9VV169QTTtur8LQPmGtG">House Bill 721</a>, which was continued to 2025. Committee members raised concerns over potential problems and wanted to see some research, possibly from the Virginia Housing Commission. One member suggested a possible pilot program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This was the third year that Clark <a href="https://www.richmondsunlight.com/legislator/neclark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.richmondsunlight.com/legislator/neclark/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531399000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0hDRg5AW9NRmmd69B-M6iE">attempted</a> to pass some type of rent stabilization bill. The others were tabled or passed by indefinitely. The fact that the bill was not struck down shows growing support, Clark said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It does show that the General Assembly is ready to have conversations,” Clark said. “I’m happy that the chair of that committee and the members of that committee is willing to work with me throughout this year to bring stakeholders together, to bring work groups together.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Clark represents constituents in the Hampton Roads area where 53.5% of residents spend 30% or more of their income on rent, according to a Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/arh-2024-cost-burden-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/arh-2024-cost-burden-share&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531399000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OsXjAf-RTYqnvdX0RNwNQ">report</a>. In the Richmond and Charlottesville areas, 52% of renters spend 30% of their income on rent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That is on par with and in some cases greater than percentages in major metropolitan areas around the country, according to the report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This year, we’re focused on rent gouging because we see throughout our commonwealth that rent has been going up in certain places 20, 30, 40, 50% and even higher in some places,” Clark said. “We see that these are predatory tactics that some developers and landowners and leasing people are using.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Clark’s bill advanced from the Counties, Cities and Towns Committee on a bipartisan vote. It was then referred to the Courts of Justice Civil subcommittee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There was testimony in support of and against the bill, which boiled down to renters versus property owners and managers. Virginia constituents have shared stories of how their rent jumped 33% and even higher in certain cases, according to Gustavo Espinosa with the Legal Aid Justice Center.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Espinosa translated for several speakers who offered testimony. One South Richmond renter asked lawmakers for help and to limit rent increases because “our salaries aren’t going up so much.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The rent increase has been too much,” said María Lopez, another renter. “We have families and our salary is not enough to pay for everything.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lopez said it is unjust that landlords can raise rent so much.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People in opposition to the bill testified that it was well intentioned but would ultimately be ineffective. The state already has a housing supply issue and the bill would exacerbate it, speakers said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Marla Posey, a member of the Virginia Apartment Management Association, has worked in states with rent control and said the bill could decrease housing supply and quality. She thinks the legislation would harm people instead of help them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Here in Virginia, we need policy to support adding new housing opportunities … to be able to house more Virignians, not enacting policy that will halt housing development,” Posey said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rent control also stymies other business development such as grocery stores, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill is not a rent-control measure, Clark said. Allowed rent increases would be evaluated annually. A locality could create a board to also hear arguments for higher increases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New properties would be exempt from any local ordinance for the first 15 years of ownership, Clark said. The original proposal set the exemption at 10 years but was <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+HB721AHC" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241%2Bamd%2BHB721AHC&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531400000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1lqlnFB8UF56SypxlyBrC-">amended</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the current system was working, the state would not be short 200,000 affordable units and Richmond rents would not top those in New York City, Clark said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We clearly have a problem and the formula that we&#8217;re using now doesn&#8217;t work,” Clark said. “This will give localities the power and the option … to enact this ordinance … to help people improve their lives.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Real estate” or “construction” groups held the <a href="https://www.vpap.org/money/donors-sector/?year=2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/money/donors-sector/?year%3D2022&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531400000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0_EJk-azUYU81o7ZO7mS3Q">No. 3 spot</a> for campaign donations, when ranked by industry, according to a Virginia Public Access Project analysis. Donations from organizations that fall under that industry totaled $31.6 million from 2022 to 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Affordable housing was among the top three issues Democratic voters want to see the governor and lawmakers tackle, according to a recent <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-01-24.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-01-24.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1707856531400000&amp;usg=AOvVaw135bOlw35CbbP71tPRMqtw">survey</a> from the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University.</p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. — As a teacher and mother to a child with autism, Elizabeth Callahan is all too familiar with flaws in the Virginia mental health care system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I see the longevity of it, and there’s just so many holes,” Callahan said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Callahan’s son was diagnosed by a developmental pediatrician at the onset of his symptoms, which included speech issues, she said. He went to occupational therapy for years until COVID-19 halted in-person visits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Her child’s therapist quit during the pandemic because “she said she would make more on unemployment,” according to Callahan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Callahan watches her students struggle to be seen by psychiatrists for diagnoses. Though schools provide some resources for students, they cannot provide an official diagnosis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I just see it taking forever for families to get appointments,” Callahan said. “It takes months.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is a significant shortage of practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists, or CAPs, across the United States, according to data from the <a href="https://www.aacap.org/aacap/Advocacy/Federal_and_State_Initiatives/Workforce_Maps/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aacap.org/aacap/Advocacy/Federal_and_State_Initiatives/Workforce_Maps/Home.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1701807177606000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0nbynzCE7u-iomlYWvEeCz">American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</a>. These physicians specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of mental and behavioral patterns that affect children. They complete medical school and have a three-year residency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The AACAP data classified states into four groups: States with a sufficient supply of CAPs, a high shortage, a severe shortage and no CAPs. Virginia is in a severe shortage, with just 264 CAPs in the state as of 2019, the most recent data available.</p>
<p><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-DiAuO" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" title="Virginia localities without CAPS" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/DiAuO/3/" height="435" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Map" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script></p>
<p dir="ltr">That means on average there are 14 CAPs available per 100,000 children in Virginia, which is also the national average. The academy defines a “mostly sufficient supply” as more than 47 per 100,000 children. Nationwide, few counties meet that standard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, the city of Richmond has 22 CAPs and almost 40,000 children under the age of 18. By the AACAP ranking, the city has 55 CAPS per 100,000 children — considered a sufficient supply. It is 1 of 9 localities in Virginia that does, out of 133. Eighty-five counties in the state have no CAP.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Children have been unable to receive timely mental health care because of the shortage, according to Callahan.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Virginia ranks No. 37 among states when it comes to accessing mental health services, according to the 2022 Mental Health America <a href="https://mhanational.org/sites/default/files/2022%20State%20of%20Mental%20Health%20in%20America.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mhanational.org/sites/default/files/2022%2520State%2520of%2520Mental%2520Health%2520in%2520America.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1701807177606000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2QOVTY_H4uQL3cQ7JdxRa9">state rankings</a>. There are nine measures in the ranking, which include adults and youth who did not receive or could not afford treatment and mental health workforce availability.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why are there so few CAPs?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Emily Moore, policy analyst with Voices for Virginia’s Children, said there is a lack of mental health care for children due to a system that is not “structured and designed with young people in mind,” and because COVID-19 exacerbated workforce issues.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People enter the field because they want to make change, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They’re realizing that they are up against a system that is not designed to support people the way that they need to be supported,” Moore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moore encouraged families on long waitlists to look into nonprofit agencies in Virginia designed with mental health in mind, though they are not substitutes for treatment, according to Moore.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Until we can truly transform the system rather than just patch it up and put Band-Aids on it, resilience is a part of our work,” Moore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also said the state legislature needs to provide adequate funding for children’s mental health care, and that early mental health intervention should be prioritized and normalized to avoid mental health crises. The crisis system should not be the entry point to the mental health system, Moore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is Virginia doing to fix it?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Mental health-related emergency room visits at the beginning and height of the pandemic went up, while physical-related visits went down, according to Dr. Bela Sood. Emergency room doctors and pediatricians were not prepared for the mental health emergencies they faced, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sood is lead CAP for the Virginia Mental Health Access Program, or VMAP, and oversees the work of all child psychiatrists involved in the program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VMAP is a statewide <a href="https://vmap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vmap.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1701807177606000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3pnbr03sPbUeklVgOidmYc">initiative </a>that strives to give kids greater mental health access by teaching pediatricians to function like psychiatrists. Pediatricians are taught how to screen, diagnose, manage and treat mental health in children.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s amplifying the knowledge that we have as child psychiatrists into the world of general pediatrics,” Sood said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sood had tried to pitch programs like VMAP to the state since 2001, but said the program didn’t receive funding until 2018. The Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services is the umbrella funding agency for programs like VMAP.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Her biggest concern with the shortage is the lack of therapists.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Even as a practicing child psychiatrist, when I refer for therapy, I have no idea who’s going to be treating the child I’m sending them, and what kind of treatment they’re going to deliver,” Sood said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia needs to design a platform that can be sustained through collaboration and shared resources, or else child health care will remain fragmented, according to Sood.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As rich a country as the United States, the manner in which health care delivery is spun out into a place is shocking and unconscionable,” Sood said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also said Virginia needs to “ramp up” its ability to train therapists and saturate them across the state to help with the understaffing issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Child mental health is one of those arenas where people are naturally collaborative,” Sood said. “The collaboration really yields very good results.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mitigating the CAP shortage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Richmond Behavioral Health Authority, or RBHA, provided behavioral and primary medical services to <a href="https://www.rbha.org/about/history.aspx" target="_blank">over 5% of the population of Richmond in 2019</a>. The agency states that one-third of its clients cannot pay for vital services.</p>

<p dir="ltr">RBHA serves adults and children. It has attempted to mitigate a CAP shortage through telehealth options, increased caseload for staff and temporary staff hired from temp agencies, according to John Lindstrom, RBHA chief executive officer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The RBHA has tried to “get pretty creative” with solutions but cannot meet all the need, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The community health agency has to occasionally “turn off the spigot” if they get overloaded in terms of capacity and certain service areas, Lindstrom said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Ideally we should not be running the vacancy rates that we run if we want to offer a robust set of services to anybody that needs them,” Lindstrom said. “That is really our goal.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The child and adolescent behavioral health staffing shortage is part of a nationwide health care staffing shortage, Lindstrom said. There are incredible pressures on the system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The RBHA is focused on immediate problems they can address, such as hiring incentives, job retention and recruitment efforts.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding mental health</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Another way to increase mental health access is to increase their services in schools, said Moore, with Voices for Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our young people are asking explicitly for more support in the school system, and it really is both a matter of making it happen from a legislative standpoint and putting those laws and budget funding in place,” Moore said.</p>

The amount was bumped to $7.5 million this year after lawmakers passed the budget in September.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More than <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/2/HB6001/Chapter/1/313/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/2/HB6001/Chapter/1/313/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1701807177607000&amp;usg=AOvVaw07Tmgv3AUU19aqszm2lzom">$12 million</a> was allocated for child psychiatry and children’s crisis response services, to be divided throughout the state based on current services already offered. The funds can be used to hire or contract child psychiatrists to provide clinical services, or to train. Mental health advocates have <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/10/03/virginia-state-budget-allocates-millions-towards-mental-health-care-training-for-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/10/03/virginia-state-budget-allocates-millions-towards-mental-health-care-training-for-professionals/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1701807177607000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0X0QPhwozJysh-2LM8RsFb">said</a> the budget makes “significant investments” in mental health services across the state.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the recent urgency behind the issue, Virginia still doesn’t have an adequate number of school psychologists or licensed professional counselors, Moore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We're very lucky that there is now an urgency behind changing the system and also realizing at the same time that that doesn't mean tomorrow,” Moore said. “I hate to have to ask families to be resilient. It's not fair. They shouldn't have to be resilient.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Families should continue to share stories with local leaders and lawmakers to illustrate the urgency behind needed changes, Moore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Callahan, who has taught for 15 years, does not know how things got this bad, but is ready for a solution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I eat, sleep and breathe this every day,” Callahan said. “The year that we’re in, how are we not having more resources readily available to families? Why is this taking months and months?”</p>

<p dir="ltr">College-aged people are among the largest voting block, yet tend to have the lowest turnout in elections, according to Campus Vote Project Virginia coordinator Amber Wilt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The group is a project of the Fair Elections Center and works to reduce barriers to student voting, according to its <a href="https://www.campusvoteproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.campusvoteproject.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw14o3cieMihIabygrllmTQL">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Just over 20% of voters ages 18-29 cast a ballot in Virginia’s midterm elections last year, according to <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/state-state-youth-voter-turnout-data-and-impact-election-laws-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/state-state-youth-voter-turnout-data-and-impact-election-laws-2022&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw09fpWmL_eMM43ReifEU_w4">Tufts University</a>. The state with the highest voter turnout in that age group in 2022 was Michigan, with 36.5%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Everyone has concerns, whether it’s political or not, and they all are impacted by their ballot,” Wilt said. “So I try to work with them a little bit to identify how their concerns can be shown on the ballot.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are two primary obstacles between college students and voting, according to Wilt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“One is students not feeling like their vote matters and that it amounts to anything, and the other being that they just don’t really feel like they know enough about what’s up for election,” Wilt said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are definitely “unfortunate hurdles” that can get in the way of voting, according to Maria Reynoso, founder and executive director of We Vote VA. The group presents election information through digital content.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At the same time, there are a lot of things happening in Virginia and across the country that could be motivating factors for people to really have their voice heard,” Reynoso said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Representatives should be more transparent and present more information online to help boost turnout among young voters, according to Reynoso.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Young people are motivated. They’re energized. They want to be involved,” Reynoso said. “I think we just have to do a better job at giving access, making electoral information more accessible to people.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU Votes is a student coalition and a separate course, according to freshman Lucie Carberry, a student in the VCU Votes course. Students hosted an event Oct. 19 that mirrored a voting simulation to better prepare students for voting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“A lot of college students have the problem of being embarrassed that they don’t know how to vote and they end up not voting because of the anxiety related to the embarrassment of actually voting,” Carberry said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most Virginia universities have campus organizations to increase voter education and engagement, such URGOV at the University of Richmond, HoosVote at University of Virginia, and Marlins Vote at Virginia Wesleyan University.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There are groups on campus that are dedicated to this, and I would say search and find those groups, or go to your political science faculty members,” said Carah Ong Whaley, academic program officer at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “They’re going to be a really credible source of information if you don’t have a voting coalition on campus.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">College students face hurdles such as motivational and technical barriers when voting, Ong Whaley said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This isn’t necessarily the case in Virginia, but in other states, there’s just outright <a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0124.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2023/legislation/H0124.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0SvAd53860yW6hAHRQ9RXF">attempts</a> to block young people from voting,” Ong Whaley said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia has increased access to voting in recent years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Students can use their student ID to go vote, but they may not know that, and so helping inform them about how and demystifying the process of voting will help them get to the polls,” Ong Whaley said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Political parties can help make voting social, celebratory and communal. That is important, especially in a divisive environment, Ong Whaley said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Ask what you can do to improve your community the day after elections,” Ong Whaley said. “Especially this year when we’re talking about state and local elections, you know, these are really elections that impact our everyday lives as residents in Virginia, so it is really important to be a voter.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia college voter guide 2023</h4>

	
<p dir="ltr">Students may be confused about how to vote when away from home, especially after redistricting in 2021, according to Reynoso.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia’s redistricting may have changed a voter’s representatives or impacted the partisan lean of their district. Voters can check districts and potential changes on the Virginia General Assembly <a href="https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://whosmy.virginiageneralassembly.gov/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kY1Txc4eCFsSCHguH98iO">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Whether you’re in school, living in the district that you’re in right now, or going back home, local representation is what impacts you the most,” Reynoso said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All 140 seats in the state’s General Assembly, which creates laws for all state residents, are open this election. There are 100 seats in the House of Delegates and 40 in the Senate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are also over 2,300 candidates vying <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/candidate-list/2023-november-general-election---local-candidates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/candidate-list/2023-november-general-election---local-candidates/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Yov0drAfujrFPpwwapLZz">for election</a> to local seats and positions such as mayor, school board, board of supervisors, treasurer, clerk of court, commonwealth attorney and sheriff.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voting is important in all districts and races, according to Reynoso. Turnout can sway the outcome of races, some more than others. The Virginia Public Access Project ranks districts by leans Republican, strong Republican, leans Democratic, strong Democratic and competitive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are 11 districts rated <a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/vpap-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/vpap-index/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698234210569000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2F-QASzIyHPt2NwXzK_6E6">competitive</a> by VPAP, and a handful of others that pundits consider too close to call.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Sam Brown / Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Several Virginia municipalities have recently drafted or passed ordinances to regulate short-term rentals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scrutiny of short-term rentals mirrors a nationwide trend. Companies like Airbnb and Vrbo have become popular lodging options for tourists, as well as people in need of temporary housing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Municipalities have pushed back against the rental options for reasons that include parking issues, noise complaints, trash and septic tank use volume. Supervisors have also cited concern over loss of hospitality tax revenue, as well as limiting available housing inventory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Approximately 30 localities throughout the U.S. have regulated short-term rentals, according to a Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cities-fighting-airbnbs-with-regulations-for-short-term-rentals-2022-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.businessinsider.com/cities-fighting-airbnbs-with-regulations-for-short-term-rentals-2022-5&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697736179817000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1i9sXeF6B3OxcHoqifL14j">report</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most Virginia short-term rentals are found in more populous areas and tourist destinations, according to a Capital News Service analysis of the market research site AirDNA.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Louisa County</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The Louisa County Board of Supervisors earlier this month passed <a href="https://www.louisacounty.gov/3224/18321/Short-Term-Rental-Ordinance" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.louisacounty.gov/3224/18321/Short-Term-Rental-Ordinance&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3E2AAvU-ZI8i99OF_IEVZX">changes </a>to the short-term rental ordinance, which will take effect Jan. 1, 2024.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is now a more formal process in place for an owner to provide their contact information to the county and an HOA, if applicable. An owner must provide renters with copies of noise ordinance and solid waste policies. They must also provide the definition of special occasion and gatherings, to determine if an event would require a conditional use permit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The county staff had <a href="https://louisacova.portal.civicclerk.com/event/76/files" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://louisacova.portal.civicclerk.com/event/76/files&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2smiNVBemiq1EkS3F_fzDo">recommendations</a> that if passed would have taken effect in 2025. Those included requiring rental owners to provide documentation of septic system inspections and repairs, provide contact information, and offer one parking space per bedroom.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Citizens told county supervisors they are concerned about the septic tank failures caused by over-occupied rentals. Some of the proposed occupancy restrictions hoped to limit the impact on septic systems and prevent failures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rentals became a hot topic in Louisa due to Lake Anna tourism. There are fewer short-term rentals than in a city like Richmond or Alexandria, but the rentals are entire homes, and a majority larger than three bedrooms, according to AirDNA data.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Short-term rentals spiked in Louisa in recent years, with peak occupancy in the warmer months. There are currently 500 such rentals, according to a county spokesperson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some residents are worried about the water quality due to septic failures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We need to be inspecting these septic systems and particularly the ones where they are being overloaded in rentals,” said Phillip Winston, a Mineral resident who spoke at the meeting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality <a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/15423/637915769872530000" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/15423/637915769872530000&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3xhf9kynYqknJSmWnliyXs">added</a> Lake Anna to the state’s impaired, or “<a href="https://www.cbf.org/blogs/save-the-bay/2022/08/lake-anna-added-to-virginia-dirty-waters-list.html#:~:text=This%20summer%2C%20the%20Virginia%20Department,due%20to%20harmful%20algal%20blooms." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cbf.org/blogs/save-the-bay/2022/08/lake-anna-added-to-virginia-dirty-waters-list.html%23:~:text%3DThis%2520summer%252C%2520the%2520Virginia%2520Department,due%2520to%2520harmful%2520algal%2520blooms.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3AAa4lg3dTCBe2Z7miZbY9">dirty</a>” waters list last year, due to algae blooms. Parts of the lake have been closed multiple times due to the blooms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Lake Anna Civic Association recommended that occupancy be limited to two guests per bedroom to reduce the risk of septic tank damage, according to its <a href="https://www.lakeannavirginia.org/page-18219" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lakeannavirginia.org/page-18219&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2b800VTckZB8Jdhb83Va8q">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some zoning districts in the county are agricultural. Short-term rentals in these zoned districts are protected from most local regulation, per an <a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2023/22-036-Beasley-issued.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2023/22-036-Beasley-issued.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw21K_eeWFdn2yEnBQUTqZ3s">opinion</a> issued earlier this year by the state attorney general&#8217;s office.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Part of Lake Anna is in Spotsylvania County. Spotsylvania has drafted its own <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HanDMCDTdXtEV5ld52ges9UdP3I3JRFJ/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HanDMCDTdXtEV5ld52ges9UdP3I3JRFJ/view&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1698179703396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2luDVwYNv-ZeLPiaHBGo_x">ordinance</a> similar to Louisa.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There are over 1,000 listed units in Richmond as of September, an increase of 76% in a three-year period, according to AirDNA data. However, the majority of the units in Virginia are not operated legally, according to a <a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-07-25/short-term-rental-airbnb-vrbo-adu-sup-str" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-07-25/short-term-rental-airbnb-vrbo-adu-sup-str&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697736179817000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1bejOa8IrFFWlqgCu-GtE4">VPM review</a> of city permits in June.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond City Council recently passed a long-debated ordinance that put several new regulations on short-term rentals, including reducing the number of rentals allowed on a lot in residential zoned areas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other <a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6298765&amp;GUID=3EC00050-F614-4217-9BF1-71EF982B494D&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=short-term+rentals" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID%3D6298765%26GUID%3D3EC00050-F614-4217-9BF1-71EF982B494D%26Options%3DID%257CText%257C%26Search%3Dshort-term%2Brentals&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697736179817000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2dnqAYT77F2e755YURYc5q">ordinance</a> changes now require the rental to be located at the host&#8217;s primary residence in all residential-zoned districts and limit the maximum occupancy of a rental from 10 to eight people.</p>
<p dir="ltr">City leaders also extended the length of a short-term rental certificate to 730 days and voted to allow homeowners to build an accessory dwelling unit, within parameters, without a permit. These are smaller units like an in-law suite or carriage house.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The changes will <a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6298765&amp;GUID=3EC00050-F614-4217-9BF1-71EF982B494D&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=short-term+rentals" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID%3D6298765%26GUID%3D3EC00050-F614-4217-9BF1-71EF982B494D%26Options%3DID%257CText%257C%26Search%3Dshort-term%2Brentals&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697736179817000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2dnqAYT77F2e755YURYc5q">help</a> create a “convenient, attractive, and harmonious community” by limiting the number of transient visitors in residential neighborhoods, according to city planners.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Only homeowners can offer short-term rentals, something that 1st District City Councilmember Andreas Addison said there is confusion about.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He heard from several renters upset that they would be unable to generate money from renting out their apartments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You cannot rent out your rented apartment,” Addison said. It could be cause for eviction.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond increased regulations because of disturbances to residents, such as parking, trash and late-night noise, according to Addison.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Short-term rentals I do see as a potential cause of nuisance because if you are not an owner of that house, and you’re renting it out, you don’t really care about the neighborhood,” Addison said. “You&#8217;re just there for the money.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Caroline McDonald is a physical therapy student who plans to use Airbnb during the four months she is temporarily placed at a Richmond hospital. She used Airbnb because of the ease of the rental process, which is a monthly payment with an advance deposit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Someone still lives there, but I’m just detached from their house,” McDonald said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most rentals will primarily come from pre-existing additions, because of the costs of building a unit solely for a short-term rental, according to Addison.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I feel like a lot of the concerns and objections being raised and elevated have a place of legitimacy, but I also think they may be a little excessive,” Addison said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tourism was a metric the council heavily considered when passing the ordinance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We can&#8217;t expect people that are going to come to visit the James River with a kayak and a bike to stay in a hotel,” Addison said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hampton</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hampton City Council halted short-term rental permits in August. The decision gives the city time to receive legal guidance and consider its regulatory options, <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/money/short-term-rentals-on-hold-in-hampton-after-city-council-decides-to-study-the-issue/291-6cf7c67e-64df-4b26-ba6a-430ddf204c3e" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.13newsnow.com/article/money/short-term-rentals-on-hold-in-hampton-after-city-council-decides-to-study-the-issue/291-6cf7c67e-64df-4b26-ba6a-430ddf204c3e&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697736179817000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3oVds_25-JDjTIWikA2rat">according </a>to Hampton Mayor Donnie Tuck. The pause allows for public input on how to move forward without acting on new permits, Tuck said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nearby Virginia Beach, a popular tourist destination, has one of the highest <a href="https://library.municode.com/va/virginia_beach/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=CO_APXAZOOR_ART2GEREPRAPALDI_CCOUSST_S241.2SHTERE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://library.municode.com/va/virginia_beach/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId%3DCO_APXAZOOR_ART2GEREPRAPALDI_CCOUSST_S241.2SHTERE&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697736179817000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FgYA5LMk26WDYp54C1iZt">short-term rental </a>listing numbers in the state, at over 2,000, per market data.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Danville</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Danville has seen an over 800% increase in short-term rental listings in a three-year period, according to AirDNA. The market research indicates there are currently 154 listings. Caesars casino partially opened in Danville this year, with a full opening slated for 2024.</p>

<p dir="ltr">New voter registration has slowed for this election, compared to the last time all 140 General Assembly seats were on the ballot in 2019. The upcoming election is considered high stakes for many reasons, and college students are working to get out the vote.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Virginia is one of a few states that has an election every year. The governor and state legislature are elected in years outside of federal races.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voter registration often drops “slightly” in odd-numbered years because there is historically less interest in state legislature races, according to J. Miles Coleman, associate editor for Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a newsletter run by the University of Virginia Center for Politics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is concern that low voter registration could indicate low voter turnout, which usually dips anyhow in statehouse elections because of the number of races with <a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/candidates/general/?year=2023&amp;competition=1&amp;party_in_power=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/candidates/general/?year%3D2023%26competition%3D1%26party_in_power%3Dall&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697571866853000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0LnK5d-mjCWt0B8ZwxzTyq">no challenger.</a> What will help ensure a victory for either party is high turnout in <a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/vpap-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/vpap-index/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697571866853000&amp;usg=AOvVaw30XZLnBiXziIMvgu0J0Qle">competitive districts</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This will be the first full General Assembly election after redistricting. The new maps <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/redistricting-elevates-house-turnover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/redistricting-elevates-house-turnover/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697571866853000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1r8MOonhTbRTjEwFFMRC1v">ushered </a>in a wave of retirements, and there are a lot of first-time candidates on the ballot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More voters (42.4%) turned out in 2019 than had been seen in decades for a statehouse election. Higher turnout was part of an <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697571866853000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1cHa0KlB5rr_Vu3ELIWlwM">overall trend</a> seen after the election of former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Young voters</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Younger voters have been credited in the past for driving turnout and Democratic victories, especially in <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/2022-12/early_data_youth_vote_report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://circle.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/2022-12/early_data_youth_vote_report.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697571866853000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1dlOrzBOw-fMANq2NlSPg9">federal races</a>. Voter turnout rates at Virginia college precincts and among millennials increased in 2019, according to a <a href="https://www.whsv.com/content/news/College-precinct-and-millennial-voters-hit-the-polls-bringing-Democratic-wins-564557211.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.whsv.com/content/news/College-precinct-and-millennial-voters-hit-the-polls-bringing-Democratic-wins-564557211.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697571866853000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3CBI78Rb7C3Gm0Quc3sjat">previous </a>Capital News Service analysis of voter precinct results.

Votes do matter, he said, and it has been getting easier to vote in the past few years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Young people definitely have a lot going on, but these are critical decisions that are going to be made in Virginia based on whatever happens this election,” Coleman said. “So, I would just say not to get complacent.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Voter registration doesn&#8217;t favor one party or another,” Keena said. “But when you see lower registration, that&#8217;s concerning.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">High registration and engagement usually mean younger people are showing up, according to Keena.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Young people have their own issues that they care about,” Keena said. “It doesn&#8217;t necessarily give Republicans or Democrats an advantage, but it certainly does dictate the type of priorities and who gets elected.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans hold the governor’s mansion and a House majority, while Democrats have a Senate majority.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If Democrats win the General Assembly, they would be in a stronger position to negotiate the annual budget and pass legislation on issues like gun control and codifying the right to abortion. If Republicans gain control, Gov. Glenn Youngkin would have an easier time passing legislation to limit abortion access and institute corporate tax cuts, according to Keena.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A solid Republican victory in Virginia could also bode well for Republicans gaining control of the White House or Congress, according to Keena.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“On the flip side, if Democrats just come out and trounce the Republicans and sweep these elections, then that&#8217;s probably bad for Republicans,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Barriers to voting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite recent reforms that make it easier to vote, including a 45-day early voting period and same-day <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/same-day-voter-registration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/same-day-voter-registration/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697571866853000&amp;usg=AOvVaw29ZU7CwHC00giZGnlstqNO">registration</a>, college-age voters still have some logistical and personal barriers to voting.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Aria Lovelace is a VCU junior studying journalism and international relations. She is currently enrolled in the course VCU Votes, where students work to increase voter registration and participation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Younger people don’t always show up at the polls because they don’t know how to vote, think they’re too young, or that life is too busy, according to Lovelace.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That&#8217;s just not true,” Lovelace said. “You don&#8217;t have to be an expert to be a voter. You get to be a voter because you&#8217;re an American citizen, and you&#8217;re 18.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The course is a nonpartisan student voter engagement initiative that began in 2012 to increase voter registration on campus. VCU Votes <a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2023/03/vcu-votes-recognized-with-national-award" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.vcu.edu/article/2023/03/vcu-votes-recognized-with-national-award&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697571866853000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1JZo7Ruyw3rHCxAQQr0dTv">has registered</a> over 15,000 students to vote since then, and also helped drive turnout, according to the university.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">“Future of our country”</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The College Republicans at Virginia Tech are tabling weekly to reach and register voters, according to chapter chair Ashley Covitz. There are a lot of important local races also on the ballot, Covitz pointed out. The group has focused on “school board, town council, constitutional offices, and delegates” in Montgomery County and Blacksburg.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “With the amount of information spread through technology (i.e. social media), engaging can easily make or break a campaign,” Covitz stated over email. “Young voters are the future of our country.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Connor Eppley is a junior studying political science who is enrolled in VCU Votes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There&#8217;s too much on the line not to vote,” Eppley said. “ I know that the state legislature is going to have way more of an impact on my life than the federal government, so it’s important to turn out this time.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia has a sizable, diverse population, along with rural and urban communities. For these reasons, Virginia is often considered a bellwether state, according to Eppley.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s going to signal to voters across the country what, where we&#8217;re kind of headed politically,” Eppley said. “Presidential candidates from both sides should be tuning in to see how the election goes in Virginia.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voting information</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Early voting has begun in Virginia. The last day to officially register to vote is Oct. 16, but voters can also register the day they vote and submit a provisional ballot.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> A mail-in ballot must be requested by Oct. 27 and postmarked on or before Election Day. It must be received by the general registrar’s office by noon on Friday, Nov. 10. The last day to early vote in-person is Saturday, Nov. 4. Polls are open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Nov. 7.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Two community leaders are campaigning for the open House District 65 seat, containing Fredericksburg city and parts of Stafford and Spotsylvania counties, which was left vacant after extensive redistricting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democratic candidate Joshua Cole is a local pastor and president of the Stafford County NAACP. Cole grew up in Stafford and previously served in the House of Delegates from 2020-22, when parts of District 65 were then District 28.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cole lost his next election bid to Del. Tara Durant, R-Stafford, by less than a thousand votes. He believes he is most qualified to serve this district due to his previous legislative work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Let’s see what we can do, and keep fighting for – as I say all the time, ‘Lottie, Dottie and everybody,’” Cole said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republican candidate Lee Peters III is a captain with the Stafford County Sheriff’s Office, which he joined in 2004. The Midwest-born former Marine moved to the area after the birth of his daughter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During a September debate at the University of Mary Washington, Peters said he has put decades of work into bettering the district.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I want to make sure that we have true investments in our community to make the Fredericksburg region a powerful place to live and work,” Peters said at the debate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Peters was “handpicked and bought” by the Republican Party, Cole said. Peters agreed he was handpicked, but found the idea of being bought “insulting.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Capital News Service made multiple attempts by phone and email to interview Peters. His campaign manager said Peters would “not be partaking in that.” The campaign also would not submit a written statement, though CNS asked multiple times.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cole was a top <a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/most_raised/?filter=filing_period" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/most_raised/?filter%3Dfiling_period&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697143275028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0NFMZGB3oqZWpyOSABFEj3">fundraiser</a> between July 1 and Aug. 31, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.

<p dir="ltr">The two most recent gubernatorial races were won by roughly 51% of the vote. The past two presidential elections don’t have a decisive party lean: 2020 is hard to accurately calculate given the way early votes were assigned and 2016 was decided on a .2% margin.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A victory in this district depends entirely on turnout, according to Stephen Farnsworth, UMW Center for Leadership and Media Studies director, who moderated the debate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These hot button issues are not so much about persuading independents, but much more about convincing people who would support them … to actually do so,” Farnsworth said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Abortion and the “parents’ rights movement” are wise topics to invest in, since Cole and Peters are on level ground in many other focus areas, Farnsworth said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Constituents and debate panelists asked questions about the district’s <a href="https://fredericksburg.com/news/local/stafford-officials-create-affordable-housing-committee/article_953c8e52-b6ca-11ed-9621-b3ac43ac4211.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fredericksburg.com/news/local/stafford-officials-create-affordable-housing-committee/article_953c8e52-b6ca-11ed-9621-b3ac43ac4211.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697143275028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0APdfMeE05tieHJSZ-cqQD">affordable housing needs</a>, crime, <a href="https://www.virginiadot.org/projects/fredericksburg/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.virginiadot.org/projects/fredericksburg/default.asp&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697143275028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1DXTsReH9b1Owp9bVf7TE3">transportation funding</a>, <a href="https://fredericksburg.today/2023/08/24/spotsylvania-educators-explain-school-districts-ongoing-staff-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fredericksburg.today/2023/08/24/spotsylvania-educators-explain-school-districts-ongoing-staff-shortage/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697143275028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3mBNbsVTn2BD8yupKDe3na">teacher shortage</a> and an abortion ban.</p>

He wants to codify Roe v. Wade on a state level, and said the majority of constituents agree regardless of party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Older constituents have a unique perspective on what a ban could mean, Cole said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t remember the ‘50s and the ‘60s, before Roe v. Wade, but they do,” he said. “And they remember the alleyways. And they don’t want Virginia to go back to that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Peters’ website does not list his stance on abortion, and he had not gone on the record about it prior to the debate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s a very personal issue,” he said at the debate. “An issue that should never come out of a room with a doctor, a mom and a dad.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A 15-week term limit is the “best compromise,” Peters said at the debate.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Law and order</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Peters hopes his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbjiyUnAqOs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DqbjiyUnAqOs&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697143275028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0O_77O4cX-L_jMYQBYznan">law enforcement experience</a> will appeal to voters, and <a href="https://petersforvirginia.com/issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://petersforvirginia.com/issues/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697143275028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Rrjrk71kz5JvZknjLZTWI">promises</a> to make sure local agencies have the needed personnel, training and tools to fight crime. Peters draws on his experience in criticism of his opponent, who he says does not support officers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Officers have a harder time doing their jobs because of changes made to Virginia law while Cole was in office, Peters said at the debate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cole supported a bill that <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=202&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb5058+" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D202%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb5058%2B&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697143275028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1GbZyc7Kig-YLj6J21BOpf">regulated officer traffic stops</a> in a variety of ways. He also supported a bill that would <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202+sum+HB5013" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202%2Bsum%2BHB5013&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697143275028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FpteNlXIYRTXuiRpllfvb">end qualified immunity</a>, though that bill failed in the Democratic-led Senate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cole said he has never supported efforts to “defund the police,” as Peters’ political ads challenge. His <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2021/1/HB1800/Introduced/MR/406/6h/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2021/1/HB1800/Introduced/MR/406/6h/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697143275028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MstbJ0PC0hgBZg_gyKcEn">budget amendment</a> granted more funding to regional police academies. He also shared his support of budget amendments that <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2021/1/SB1100/Introduced/MR/479/6s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2021/1/SB1100/Introduced/MR/479/6s/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697143275028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0iTGG7MJDbRQnzjqRgDrM0">increased</a> <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2021/1/SB1100/Introduced/MR/479/7s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2021/1/SB1100/Introduced/MR/479/7s/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1697143275028000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3egDMTNfOwBfeWoLuEyhY9">officer pay</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ending qualified immunity is not about endangering officers, it’s about job accountability, Cole said. The bills were put together with police input, he said, and some provisions made officers feel more safe rather than less.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We hear it all the time – the police officers say: ‘There’s no one who hates a bad cop more than a good cop doing their job,” Cole said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Transportation</h4>

<p dir="ltr">Both candidates want to improve the region’s transportation infrastructure and agree the district should have its own regional transportation authority.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have to have a voice in how that money is spent,” Peters said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Terms like volley llamas, flabjacks and dillballs sound like a bad joke, but are actually terms used in pickleball, a sport that&#8217;s a smash hit in Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In fact, there are three upcoming pickleball tournaments in October alone and new facilities opening.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pickleball is the fastest-growing sport across the nation as of 2022, according to the national governing authority, <a href="https://usapickleball.org/about-us/organizational-docs/pickleball-annual-growth-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://usapickleball.org/about-us/organizational-docs/pickleball-annual-growth-report/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3G6ZrRyQEp0lKkJhTf_rqr">USA Pickleball</a>. The sport has taken hold in the South Atlantic region, which includes Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia ranks No. 10 in the nation for pickleball courts, as determined by the Pickleheads <a href="https://www.pickleheads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pickleheads.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3oLOkCq2w88_coEK8BXZ-Z">website</a>. The site, a 101-level sport resource and a hub for finding players, courts and groups, reports <a href="https://www.pickleheads.com/courts/us/virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pickleheads.com/courts/us/virginia&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1RNlO9FyuMb3ZKBvBl3Qo4">428</a> pickleball courts in Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The sport is a hybrid of badminton, tennis and Ping-Pong that can be played on an indoor or outdoor court.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.bangersanddinks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bangersanddinks.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3sdYAwXCFuMlFfftorcMzy">Bangers and Dinks</a> recreational pickleball facility opened in Chesterfield County in July. Nicole Thompson and husband Jack are co-owners. The spot, named after two of the sport’s terms, is central Virginia’s first indoor pickleball facility, according to Nicole Thompson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The facility offers floors with <a href="https://www.pro-cushion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pro-cushion.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1iBo53bTqIQP84lRmQ-gqi">Pro-Cushion</a> surfacing, specialized lighting, changing rooms and drink and snack options.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think pickleball is popular because it’s easy to learn but hard to master,” Thompson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Competitive camaraderie is a part of the game, according to Thompson: The pickleball culture encourages laughter and fun when playing.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://ppbrva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ppbrva.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1rLFtSD7lD5mW_TQ5OrLlC">Performance Pickleball RVA</a> will open in Henrico County on Dec. 1. The facility plans to be the largest indoor pickleball space in the region, according to chief operating officer Jon Laaser. There are 18 total courts: 12 indoor courts and six outdoor courts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Laaser wound up falling in love with pickleball, despite his initial indifference. He and his wife joined the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/390898654655805/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/groups/390898654655805/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tHeCUmKgV0NZy3NAxE_rC">Western Henrico Pickleball group</a> shortly after. His background in tennis and Ping-Pong helped him learn the game quickly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think there’s kind of a misconception because of the name, that it&#8217;s, you know, a goofy sport,” Laaser said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Pickleball is a sport for all ages, cultures and backgrounds, Laaser said. The sport offers people the chance to connect with strangers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The game has really skewed younger, and the older players that loved it in the beginning are still playing, but you really see it run the gamut age wise,” Laaser said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Laaser’s soon-to-open facility was inspired from feedback after he hosted a few pickleball tournaments with his wife. This year they hosted two pickleball tournaments: <a href="https://usapickleball.org/event/ladybug-pickleball-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://usapickleball.org/event/ladybug-pickleball-classic/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2bgyWQVsuqat_9lqUvhzKx">Ladybug Classic</a> and <a href="https://pickleballbrackets.com/ptd.aspx?eid=6e5c5aa2-a7be-48b1-8d90-5036795b0004" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pickleballbrackets.com/ptd.aspx?eid%3D6e5c5aa2-a7be-48b1-8d90-5036795b0004&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696898291396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3aqPdIf39a17ipuj_rfYOe">Body Armor 804</a>.

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">To begin the game the score must be called aloud. The server calls the serving team’s score first, then the receiving team’s score, lastly the server’s number. The first call will always be “zero-zero-two,” as the original server is referred to as the second server.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">A serve is underhanded, and cannot be above the waist. A serve is made diagonally crosscourt. At the start of the game the server is awarded only one serve.For the remainder of the game, if the serving side faults then their partner has one more opportunity to serve.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Volleys are initiated outside of the non-volley zone. A player can be in the non-volley zone as long as their opponent is not volleying the ball. A player can stay inside the non-volley zone before or after returning a bounced ball.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The receiving team must let the ball bounce once after a serve. After the initial serve, the receiving side can hit the ball out of the air or choose to allow it to bounce.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The ball cannot bounce twice. If it does it is considered a “fault,” any faults in the game means the opponents gain possession of the serve. Until another fault occurs and then the possession of the serve is switched again.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">If the serving side holds serve (serving players continue gaining points), after each point the server will alternate serving from the left to right side.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">When the servers advantage is even numbers they will serve on the right side, when the servers advantage is odd numbers they will serve on the left side. The receiving team returns the ball in the diagonal court of the server.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Similar to tennis, the ball must stay inside of the lines. The opponent can call “out,” if they believe the ball from their opponent is out of bounds.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The most commonly used scoring option is best 2 of 3 games to 11 points. Players must win by 2 points.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">After each game, players switch sides.</p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">Virginia schools will be able to hire more support staff positions, something educators say is desperately needed amid a continued teacher shortage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">State lawmakers last month approved an amended budget that will direct <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/budget/4779/HB6001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/budget/4779/HB6001/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696525404985000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2JzSqmw6v6S7khvgy4vPE3">$152 million</a> toward these school support positions. The appropriations help boost the ratio of allotted support staff per teacher. The funding ratio increased from 21 support positions per 1,000 pupils to 24 per 1,000 pupils — though the older standard was 26 support positions, according to a July <a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696525404985000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ARoAVkkeJE2yjpuxwkVBK">report</a> by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This funding has been capped for over a decade, following a <a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/sessionreport/2009/1/562/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/sessionreport/2009/1/562/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696525404985000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1-mX6yvutJkq-_ClqCjZcE">$3.7 billion shortfall</a> in the Great Recession-era budget that was never adjusted. The cap reduction resulted in a $331 million reduction in state education funding last year, according to JLARC.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Some positions limited by the cap include administrative, clerical and operations staff, as well as technology and instructional professionals, according to the <a href="https://www.vassonline.org/advocacy-policy/legislative-matters/item/vass-support-cap-position-2019-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vassonline.org/advocacy-policy/legislative-matters/item/vass-support-cap-position-2019-2020&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696525404985000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3dCtdrAT6nF6whiKJMuuAW">Virginia Association of School Superintendents website.</a> Many education groups say the cap has resulted in the loss of thousands of support staff, even as enrollment grew.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The state’s <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/virginia-board-of-education/virginia-standards-of-quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/virginia-board-of-education/virginia-standards-of-quality&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696525404985000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1eVaCYQDOvD2R_FDyaCMP1">Standards of Quality</a> provide the foundation for public education, including minimum staffing needs. The standards typically undercalculate how much staff is actually needed, according to JLARC. Elimination of the support cap was a near-term recommendation in the report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia school divisions receive less K-12 funding per student than the national average, according to JLARC. Other states receive just under $2,000 more per student.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chad Stewart, the Virginia Education Association’s policy analyst, said the support staff cap was supposed to be temporary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“An entire generation of kids have gone through their K-12 experience in the state of Virginia with far less support staff for helping their schools function and making sure that teachers weren’t overwhelmed with all these additional duties, and could focus on teaching,” Stewart said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When there is an inadequate amount of support staff in schools, teachers or other support staff have to fill multiple positions, according to Stewart.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It takes them [teachers] away from the duties they&#8217;re trained to do, which is supporting students in different ways,” Stewart said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Guidance counselors in particular have fulfilled multiple support positions, such as monitoring cafeterias or doing clerical work in the office, according to Stewart. A <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title22.1/chapter15/section22.1-291.1:1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title22.1/chapter15/section22.1-291.1:1/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696525404985000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1cZTMNAyF3TDU2I8wF7GpW">law</a> took effect July 1 to ensure counselors spend at least 80% of their time doing direct counseling of students.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Teacher Karl Knoche has worked at Virginia Beach City Public Schools since 2007. He has taught government and economics at First Colonial High School since 2014.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“All the support staff at my school does a great job of helping teachers and students, and I feel that I can go to them with any problems,” Knoche stated in an email.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Knoche has extra duties such as monitoring students between classes, during lunch and before school, which can be “time consuming,” he stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Teachers seem to have more responsibilities outside of the classroom than when he first started teaching, according to Knoche.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have been fortunate at my school to be fairly well staffed,” Knoche stated. “We have had issues with having enough custodians, but that isn’t due to the lack of jobs, but the lack of interest in the jobs.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia leaders have grappled with teaching vacancies in recent years. The General Assembly committed to increasing compensation with 5% pay increases over three consecutive fiscal years starting in 2022, according to <a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575-3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575-3.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696525404985000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1vRu0OFoUzYrya1cCSYydD">JLARC</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the pay increases may not address low or no compensation in previous years, coupled with inflation the past two years, the report stated. Additionally, not every school division could fund the full 5% increases because their locality does not provide enough matching funds “for employees not recognized through the SOQ formula.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia ranks No. 22 for teacher pay, which is an average salary of about $61,000, according to the <a href="https://www.nea.org/resource-library/educator-pay-and-student-spending-how-does-your-state-rank" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nea.org/resource-library/educator-pay-and-student-spending-how-does-your-state-rank&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696525404985000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0nGkoQahp91ekYUYvcVqE-">National Education Association</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The state had over 3,500 unfilled teaching positions in the 2022-23 school year. Elementary school teachers accounted for the most vacancies, followed by special education, according to <a href="https://p1pe.doe.virginia.gov/apex/f?p=352:1:103532399475203:SHOW_REPORT::::" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://p1pe.doe.virginia.gov/apex/f?p%3D352:1:103532399475203:SHOW_REPORT::::&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696525404985000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3alFaEO4JTds9i6oUpkn9U">data</a> from the Virginia Department of Education. Special education positions had the highest percentage of unfilled positions, at 5.8%, followed by world language and then elementary school teachers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The VDOE announced a <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/teaching-in-virginia/turning-the-tide" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/teaching-in-virginia/turning-the-tide&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696525404985000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3KUjrqt3m7mIAkwRzNGXeu">strategic plan</a> in 2022 to improve teacher recruitment and retention. The goals are to make it easier for qualified teachers to be hired, consider more candidates eligible to fulfill open positions and reinforce strategies that maintain a thriving workplace, such as programs focused on teacher retention.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The use of appropriated funds will vary by district, but the intent is that local school divisions will use funds for support staff positions, according to a VDOE email response.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The governor and lawmakers have removed close to “three-quarters of the support positions cap” in the past two sessions, the VDOE stated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Virginia could have its fifth casino if a local referendum passes in November, though Richmond voters rejected it the first time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The proposal would extend casino gambling into central Virginia. There are two casinos open in the southern and southwest parts of the state. One casino is operational in eastern Virginia, with one more slated to open next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Richmond Grand Resort and Casino is a $562 million proposal by Black-owned multimedia conglomerate Urban One and new partner Churchill Downs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond voters rejected the first proposal backed by Urban One in November 2021, but on a snug margin of under <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/election-1707/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/election-1707/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446336000&amp;usg=AOvVaw29HpDvL7Z2PZAVca_E6lSh">1,500 votes.</a> There was overwhelming support in the 8th and 9th Districts where the casino would be located. Voters in the 3rd, 6th and 7th Districts <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/election-1707/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/election-1707/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446336000&amp;usg=AOvVaw29HpDvL7Z2PZAVca_E6lSh">showed</a> support for the project. There was strong disapproval in the other four districts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond is not the first city to find itself in this debate. There was initial concern from local residents before a casino opened in Danville, according to City Manager Ken Larkin. The casino helped buffer some of the city’s industry losses, and “the economic benefits won the day,” Larkin told <a href="https://www.wral.com/story/nc-gamblers-make-trek-to-danville-to-try-luck-at-new-casino/20918014/#:~:text=The%20full%20casino%20is%20expected%20to%20open%20in%20late%202024." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wral.com/story/nc-gamblers-make-trek-to-danville-to-try-luck-at-new-casino/20918014/%23:~:text%3DThe%2520full%2520casino%2520is%2520expected%2520to%2520open%2520in%2520late%25202024.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446336000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ZxQZUY6VkOe_JbXRtvas9">WRAL</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Casino opposition in Richmond has reignited while project leaders have expanded their strategic approach to sway voters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Developers have plenty of funding for outreach, with over <a href="https://www.vpap.org/committees/474359/richmond-wins-vote-yes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/committees/474359/richmond-wins-vote-yes/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446336000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3LX_FssvvlCAj49eLPcFrP">$8 million </a>tucked into a pro-casino committee. Opponents <a href="https://www.vpap.org/committees/474361/no-means-no-casino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/committees/474361/no-means-no-casino/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446336000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0qb1xh_r8slmf-IxqcmlOT">have raised</a> far less, similar to 2021, but have maintained an influential message.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The developers hope to convince voters that the casino could benefit Southside and Richmond. They see it as more than just a casino and promise an array of extras that includes a 55-acre greenspace, luxury spa and concert venue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The city would <a href="https://www.rva.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/Resort%20Casino%20FAQs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.rva.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/Resort%2520Casino%2520FAQs.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446336000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0rLQFfgodklk9LtUmu2Kiu">receive</a> an initial $25 million payment if the referendum passes, and city leaders have also stated that the project would not cost taxpayers. The development would create 1,300 jobs and offer a “pathway into the middle class,” according to Michael Kelly, spokesperson for the Urban One project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s going to generate $30 million of annual revenue for the city to invest in city priorities like childhood education,” Kelly said. “It&#8217;s also going to do a lot to improve Southside, an area that needs investment and wants investment.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not everyone is convinced the casino will solve Southside’s economic woes. Allan-Charles Chipman, a previous Richmond City Council candidate, thinks public officials and developers have exaggerated the casino’s potential benefits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Casinos are not proven to help decrease economic wealth gaps,” Chipman said. “If anything, they&#8217;ve been shown to worsen them.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The City Council vote to put a referendum back on the ballot drew public ire and an ongoing lawsuit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond Lodge No. 1 of the Good Lions, Inc., a Southside-based organization that raises money through charitable gaming, filed a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/664454833/2023-08-11-Memorandum-in-Support-of-Motion-to-Reconsider#" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.scribd.com/document/664454833/2023-08-11-Memorandum-in-Support-of-Motion-to-Reconsider%23&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446337000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3BWWbCrcrodLACiiABxYk8">lawsuit</a> claiming Council violated the state constitution by not allowing a complete public bidding process.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> The court rejected the lawsuit on the grounds that Good Lions failed to properly challenge the constitutionality of the bidding process. They also failed to prove any harm to their operations if the referendum were to pass.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s sort of circular logic because, first of all, we weren&#8217;t a potential bidder because it was a no-bid contract — nobody was a potential bidder,” said attorney and Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax, who represented the Good Lions. “We&#8217;re a business in the City of Richmond, we should have as much standing as anybody else.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Good Lions filed an appeal to the ruling last week, according to a Virginia Business <a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/richmond-lodge-appeals-courts-casino-ruling/?oly_enc_id=9574E3104245J5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/richmond-lodge-appeals-courts-casino-ruling/?oly_enc_id%3D9574E3104245J5D&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446337000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1pYHXnI0OMvCy7BG2Tk2H0">report</a>. It is unknown if the appeal would be heard before Election Day, but early voting is already underway.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Churchill Downs representative Adisa Muse and 8th District Councilmember Reva Trammell recently hosted a district-wide meeting to inform voters about the casino and address concerns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">People voiced apprehension, but many were in support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One attendee questioned how developers can promise a $55,000 annual salary, when local gaming parlor salaries <a href="https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=casino&amp;l=City+of+Richmond%2C+VA&amp;vjk=f164f1bdcea275ce" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q%3Dcasino%26l%3DCity%2Bof%2BRichmond%252C%2BVA%26vjk%3Df164f1bdcea275ce&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446337000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1jmOMrT_Bk1qhUd8lfp7CA">start</a> at around $30,000. Gaming parlors don’t have table games or generate the same cash as a <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title58.1/chapter41/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title58.1/chapter41/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446337000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2dqRltvExQ_tciWFjP4lMY">casino</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The take home salary alone would likely not be $55,000. The proposed compensation touted by developers is a package that includes wages, tips and benefits. The minimum pay for tipped and non-tipped employees would be $15 per hour, according to <a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6215716&amp;GUID=DF30122B-EBC2-44D1-9B7A-4BFE2854B76E" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID%3D6215716%26GUID%3DDF30122B-EBC2-44D1-9B7A-4BFE2854B76E&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446337000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3aL2hIj5yzKpnKTjBiH4Qx">city documents</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another attendee was worried the new casino would increase property taxes. Muse said the project will not raise taxes and will generate revenue for the entire city.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Lowering real estate taxes was a conversation in 2021,” Muse said. “Right now we have the ability to provide more funding for infrastructure through the series of taxes that are being collected through this development.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tax revenue promises didn’t sway enough city voters in 2021, according to data by the <a href="https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/election-1707/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/electionresults/20211102/election-1707/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446337000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Woutla5TVBcIx75BlP-QJ">Virginia Public Access Project</a>. Urban One and Churchill Downs are now primarily targeting voters in the 8th and 9th Districts to drive turnout.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We can go to some of the other areas of the city, when they find out about this, they get completely antagonistic to what we&#8217;re doing,” Muse said. “So we have to be very focused, we have to be very targeted and that means that we&#8217;re not hitting doors as massively in other parts of Richmond.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">One reason the previous proposal failed to pass was confusion on the location, according to 9th District Councilmember Michael Jones. He also noted a racial divide in Southside voting patterns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It didn&#8217;t pass in any predominantly white precinct and it passed in most predominantly African American precincts,” he said. “What went on there, what wasn&#8217;t communicated, that something became racially divisive?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jones believes some white voters took a moral stance against the casino.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As an African-American male, I have a problem hearing white people say ‘this is not good for Black people, this is not good for poor people,’” Jones said. “That&#8217;s a very paternalistic view and perspective.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Developers like to highlight the variety of all-ages entertainment that the casino would offer — from dining to outdoor recreation to gaming. Urban One is primarily a media broadcasting company. It held stake in the MGM National Harbor Hotel &amp; Casino in Maryland, but cashed out earlier this year, according to multiple <a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-07-10/urban-one-richmond-casino-financial-disclosure-delays" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-07-10/urban-one-richmond-casino-financial-disclosure-delays&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446337000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1IqJwmD-unIAoDzIJi3luU">reports</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Richmond Grand is going to be a real attractive place for folks to come and visit for any number of activities,” project spokesperson Kelly said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The casino’s location near Interstate 95 will make it easy to attract visitors from outside the region and generate revenue that can be reinvested into the city, according to Kelly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Still, Chipman, and other vocal opponents, believe there are better ways to fund Southside.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “Like [Sen.] Tim Kaine said the <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/senator-kaine-votes-no-to-one-casino-as-richmond-residents-gear-up-for-election-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/senator-kaine-votes-no-to-one-casino-as-richmond-residents-gear-up-for-election-day/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1696008446337000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0-UFhz1mCwCXt5kkOdLG1Q">first time</a>, there are more equitable ways to develop Southside,” Chipman said. “I don&#8217;t feel good that developers go to the bargaining table, but somehow Southside has to go to the blackjack table.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">A Virginia Commonwealth University professor and a partner are developing a new THC breathalyzer that could be used to quickly detect if someone is driving under the influence of cannabis.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU professor Emanuele Alves, who has a doctorate in forensic science, partnered with Wagner Pacheco, who has a doctorate in inorganic analytical chemistry and is an associate professor at Universidade Federal Fluminense. Pacheco traveled from Brazil earlier in the year to help develop the breathalyzer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The device would offer immediate results and produce fewer false positives, according to Alves. Law enforcement and employers could test within a certain window of time for impairment that many tests, such as urine or hair analysis, do not offer. A blood test can track cannabis use within a <a href="https://lobdock.com/2020/08/new-instant-thc-test-shows-drug-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lobdock.com/2020/08/new-instant-thc-test-shows-drug-use/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2J4OgeZnmRyAq3iN9HTU3d">3- to 4-hour time frame</a> but is not a viable driver impairment option. Current THC breathalyzers take <a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2023/08/vcu-forensic-science-professor-hopes-a-better-thc-breathalyzer-will-increase-road-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.vcu.edu/article/2023/08/vcu-forensic-science-professor-hopes-a-better-thc-breathalyzer-will-increase-road-safety&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw33iHJRqHN95OS5x1OwGTLg">hours</a> to achieve results.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The VCU-developed breathalyzer will also distinguish between the presence of THC and CBD, which have different effects, in someone’s system. CBD does not get a user high and is often sold as supplemental or personal care products.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The device will produce a change in color if a person has THC in their system and a different color for CBD, according to Pacheco.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our expectation is that this THC breathalyzer could be so useful for society as it is the alcohol breathalyzer,” Pacheco said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Law enforcement would be able to identify on-site if a driver is under the influence of THC. The breathalyzer could improve road safety by holding drivers accountable for driving impaired, Pacheco said. It is <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-266/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title18.2/chapter7/section18.2-266/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0qdOftdxEOGKBb82sUULV7">illegal</a> to operate a vehicle while impaired.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The goal is to have the first prototype of the THC breathalyzer complete by 2025.</p>
<p dir="ltr">JM Pedini, development director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or <a href="https://norml.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://norml.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2r6IEqcIf1ku4J7BmBocJe">NORML</a>, said they do not agree with the development and eventual use of THC breathalyzers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Studies have failed to prove that the presence of THC in breath is an indicator of either impairment or recent cannabis exposure, Pedini said. NORML has argued against the expansion of drug detection testing and advocated instead for performance-based tests to determine someone’s sobriety.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Examples include the <a href="https://www.impairmentscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.impairmentscience.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2bBJlGSXFXTl9tizOJVE3t">DRUID</a> test, which is an app that measures cognitive and motor functioning to test for impairment. The test measures such things as the person’s reaction time, hand-eye coordination and balance. The measurements are then calculated and an impairment <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/druidapp/id1107595146" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/druidapp/id1107595146&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2MaaEfYM2I3RYcrGEwX2Cq">score</a> is provided.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One reason NORML does not support THC breathalyzers is because the packaging of CBD products does not always accurately reflect their contents, according to Pedini.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Because of the lack of regulatory oversight on products that are called CBD, a consumer may be of the belief that they are buying a product that contains just CBD when, in fact, it actually contains THC,” Pedini said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The VCU Police Department issued 20 DUIs in the past year, two of which “indicated the presence of some drug or narcotic,” according to police Detective Frederick Wiggins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Colorado was the first state to legalize recreational cannabis. Almost 80 deaths were reported in 2021 that involved a driver who had more than the allowed limit of THC, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2023/04/20/driving-high-colorado-crashes-cannabis-marijuana" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2023/04/20/driving-high-colorado-crashes-cannabis-marijuana&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1695414923605000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0kgh02IwKpNlthAEFB5P4X">Axios Denver</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond Police did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU Police complete field sobriety test training to help identify impairment and then can use other tests “to determine beyond that,” according to Wiggins.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are still many steps before the breathalyzer is ready for the market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The VCU Police are constantly evaluating new equipment and I would personally say that any new tool that is evaluated and found could be useful would be of use to officers in any capacity,” Wiggins said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The regional Fall Line Trail is set to officially break ground in Henrico County next month. The 43-mile-long trail will span from Petersburg to Ashland and serve as a counterpart to the Capital Trail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Regional planners see it as a “spine trail” that can connect towns, schools, businesses, public transit stations and other trail networks throughout Central Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s basically an alternative transportation corridor for non-motorized vehicles that will connect to a lot of things,” said Todd Eure, assistant director of the Henrico County Department of Public Works.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Eure is a member of the Fall Line work group committee for PlanRVA, a state-designated council of nine localities that collaborate on regional projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Henrico County plans to start on the project in October, near Bryan Park. County leaders have designed the trail, set aside funding and begun to acquire land easements for their section. Henrico’s portion of the trail is over 7 miles long and will be built in eight phases, <a href="https://henrico.us/projects/flt-park-street/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://henrico.us/projects/flt-park-street/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1694811655925000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Uc-fNFs4nftI7zqdYCNU4">according to the county</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The work will start near the City of Richmond line with an asphalt shared-use path from Bryan Park Avenue across Lakeside Avenue and into Spring Park. The project is a quarter-mile long and <a href="https://henrico.us/assets/PIM_FLT-SouthernSecton_-Brochure_FinalReview-1.pdf" target="_blank">estimated to cost $1.2 million</a>. The next phase, estimated at $3.3 million, will <a href="https://henrico.us/assets/PIM_FLT-SouthernSecton_-Brochure_FinalReview-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://henrico.us/assets/PIM_FLT-SouthernSecton_-Brochure_FinalReview-1.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1694811655925000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1nWQZS_pDFpePG3s4Z_8lR">extend </a>the trail from Spring Park to Dumbarton Road. Eventually, the trail will reach the Chickahominy River at the boundary line between Henrico and Hanover counties. The county hopes to have its work completed by 2025, according to Eure, although the plans <a href="https://henrico.us/projects/fall-line-trail/#:~:text=Henrico%20County%20is%20striving%20to,constructed%20within%204%2D5%20years." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://henrico.us/projects/fall-line-trail/%23:~:text%3DHenrico%2520County%2520is%2520striving%2520to,constructed%2520within%25204%252D5%2520years.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1694811655925000&amp;usg=AOvVaw27LfkZP5WA6gc3xu5sTgOu">allow</a> for a longer time frame. Planners hope to complete the Ashland to Richmond section by 2025.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We&#8217;re trying to design ours to be a world-class trail,” Eure said. “We are making it wider than the Capital Trail, so we&#8217;re doing ours at 12 feet wide, as opposed to 10 feet, because we are building it for success.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Organizers face a few challenges ahead of the entire trail’s completion. There is an overall $30 to $50 million funding gap, according to Eure. Everything from Ashland to Richmond is already funded.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Local and state funding, along with federal grants and private donations, helped raise $250 million. The trail originally was estimated to cost <a href="https://www.virginiadot.org/projects/richmond/fall-line-trail.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.virginiadot.org/projects/richmond/fall-line-trail.asp&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1694811655925000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2AZAmnT9OvBKCCoGay2PF4">approximately </a>$266 million. Costs have gone up marginally due to inflation and other design reasons.</p>

<p dir="ltr">PlanRVA still needs to buy some land for the trail and determine what percentage of out-of-pocket construction costs counties and townships will pay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Members of the Central Virginia Transportation Authority Fall Line Trail work group met on Sept. 6. Topics discussed ranged from the content and color of signage to the funding gap and how to incorporate information about local history and nature along the trail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There will be 11 miles of trail under construction once Henrico breaks ground, followed by Hanover County in January, said Emily Monroe, community engagement coordinator for Bike Walk RVA, a Sports Backers affiliate. It is “really massive” to see the project take shape after years of paperwork, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So seeing these big connections really start to happen is exciting,” Monroe said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond recently secured approximately $30 million for parts of the trail through state funding, according to Sports Backers’ Bike Walk RVA. The group also helped raise some funding for the Fall Line’s development by hosting community engagement events at hikes, rides, and events along parts of the trail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">State and local support for a massive regional trail wouldn’t have been possible without the success of the Capital Trail, according to Eure, who has worked closely with the Capital Trail Foundation and witnessed the uphill battle to get the trail supported, funded and built. The 52-mile trail runs east from Richmond’s downtown riverfront into Williamsburg. The Fall Line Trail will run north to south and provide a connection over to the Capital Trail.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Nobody wants the Fall Line Trail to take 20 years,” said Eure. &#8220;I think at a regional level, everybody understands the value that these trails bring to the residents of the region and to tourism, to economic development.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The projected date for the completed trail is sometime between 2029 and 2031.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The quality of life for citizens along the trail will “improve drastically,” according to Monroe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When community members are able to feel safe when they walk, bike or roll, they&#8217;re more inclined to use alternate methods of transportation in more aspects of their daily lives,” she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>This story was corrected to note that the $30 million secured in Richmond was from state funding.</em></p>

There are a handful of limitations such as information that could prevent an act of terrorism against the U.S., according to the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill would also prevent important data on a reporter’s personal device from being seized without notice. The same would apply to data held by a covered service provider like a telecommunications company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both the House and Senate versions of the bill have bipartisan support. U.S. Rep. Ben Cline, R-Virginia, is a cosponsor of the current iteration of the House bill. The House passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4330?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22PRESS+act%22%5D%7D&amp;s=5&amp;r=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4330?q%3D%257B%2522search%2522%253A%255B%2522PRESS%2Bact%2522%255D%257D%26s%3D5%26r%3D10&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1694634114000000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2gVL_jDNQUwD4AgYs1jBY7">original resolution</a> introduced in 2021, but it failed to advance from a Senate committee.

<p dir="ltr">Virginia is one of <a href="https://www.rcfp.org/reporters-privilege/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.rcfp.org/reporters-privilege/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1694634114000000&amp;usg=AOvVaw39-UKdeRAhW4sNvDFa1XX3">10 states without a formal shield law</a>, according to the legal group Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Currently, Virginia courts recognize a reporter’s privilege, meaning the right not to be compelled to testify or disclose sources and information in court. The proposed federal law may provide a model or incentive for a shield law at the state level, according to Mechelle Hankerson, president of the Society of Professional Journalists Virginia Pro Chapter. (Hankerson formerly worked for the Mercury.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re sort of at the mercy of the courts’ whims and interpretations of situations and the First Amendment when we don’t have a shield law,” Hankerson said. “Even though the courts have ruled favorably for us as journalists, there’s no guarantee that that will continue.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The national SPJ organization has advocated for a federal shield law for the past two decades, Hankerson said. One of the reasons it has been a slow process at both the federal and state levels is because many courts have ruled in favor of protecting journalists, which obscures the need for shield laws.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, attempted three times to establish a state shield law. A version that passed in 2020 was amended to apply protections in a criminal proceeding. <a href="https://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2020/hb113/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2020/hb113/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1694634114000000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0rzsSL4WTGyBrIWZx8-pAA">The bill</a> has specific parameters for the definition of a working journalist that is not found in the PRESS Act, such as that they must belong to a news organization.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“I don’t think that there is anything on the horizon or that has happened super recently in Virginia that makes us feel like we’re in danger if we don’t get a shield law on the books,” Hankerson said. “But it is something, the longer it’s not there, the more vulnerable we are as journalists.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Protections given by shield laws such as the PRESS Act allow journalists and news organizations to establish trusted relationships with sources, according to Lin Weeks, a senior staff attorney at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The organization provides free counsel and legal resources to journalists to protect First Amendment freedoms and newsgathering rights, according to its <a href="https://www.rcfp.org/what-we-do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.rcfp.org/what-we-do/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1694634114000000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vmCSMr0WjvcG4IZ_aUVXM">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If the government for courts or civil litigants can compel journalists to reveal the subjects of those conversations of their unpublished work product, that undermines journalists’ ability to do their job,” Weeks said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The PRESS Act would codify some of the guardrails the Department of Justice has in place through its updated <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1255561/dl?inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.justice.gov/media/1255561/dl?inline&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1694634114000000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0_439tzCuzcdCFfnoAMvdi">news media guidelines</a>, which limit access to journalists’ records.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“With something like the DOJ guidelines, those can be changed without a legislative vote from administration to administration,” Weeks said. “Whereas the PRESS Act would last through multiple administrations.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill shields both professional and citizen journalists from being forced to disclose their sources through broadly defining a journalist to include any person who regularly gathers or records information with the intention of public dissemination.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Genelle Belmas holds a doctorate in mass communication and is a professor of media law at the University of Kansas. A broad definition is a good thing, Belmas said. Any individual who gathers and organizes information to disseminate it to the public should be protected in the same way as a journalist with a major or local news organization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The bigger question, as some people have suggested, is: ‘Are you committing acts of journalism?’” Belmas said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The First Amendment doesn’t make those distinctions, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A number of trade organizations have endorsed the bill, including the News/Media Alliance, Radio Television Digital News Association and the National Association of Broadcasters.

<p dir="ltr">The Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication and the Association of Schools of Journalism and Mass Communication stated the bill “empowers the media to play its essential role as a watchdog holding our government accountable.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">AEJMC and ASJMC announced to its members that they plan to lobby in support of the bill.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>By Darlene Johnson / Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Graduation is a month away for approximately <a href="https://p1pe.doe.virginia.gov/apex/f?p=180:1:::::p_session_id,p_application_name:-485545341098751784,fallmembership" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://p1pe.doe.virginia.gov/apex/f?p%3D180:1:::::p_session_id,p_application_name:-485545341098751784,fallmembership&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1V8iJTcqLs1iuJis9-94sX" target="_blank">90,000</a> Virginia high school seniors. For some, that milestone is cut short by tragedy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When a high school student dies before graduation, it can be difficult for a family to obtain a posthumous diploma.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">State lawmakers this recent General Assembly session passed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1514" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231%2Bsum%2BHB1514&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oJZZ1Y-GzyO56pSJzHy0D" target="_blank">House Bill 1514</a> to require the Board of Education to waive certain graduation requirements for senior students who die before graduation. The bill allows posthumous diplomas to be awarded at the request of parents if the student was in good standing in their senior year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, these waivers can still be considered on a case-by-case basis, according to the bill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Previously, <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-253.13:4/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-253.13:4/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3c9XjLYiUuNMDe2CtSOBqj" target="_blank">state code</a> only required such diplomas to be awarded if they were initiated by the Board of Education or requested by a local school board.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Dawn Adams, D-Richmond, introduced the measure after the mother of a murdered Thomas Jefferson High School <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/03/22/thomas-jefferson-hs-students-protest-demand-diploma-murdered-classmate/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbc12.com/2022/03/22/thomas-jefferson-hs-students-protest-demand-diploma-murdered-classmate/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qPmITsGihCPiAwlByp-l4" target="_blank">student</a> reached out for assistance with her son&#8217;s goal to receive his high school diploma, Adams stated. Daveon Elliot was fatally shot in November 2021.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The family was told the school could only award a certificate of completion because he had not met the outlined graduation <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/parents-students/for-students/graduation/diploma-options/standard-diploma-graduation-requirements" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doe.virginia.gov/parents-students/for-students/graduation/diploma-options/standard-diploma-graduation-requirements&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw26w5apoxrNRuaVy_FJYFvE" target="_blank">requirements</a>, Adams stated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Elliot’s senior yearbook picture had already been taken, the mother told WWBT <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/03/22/thomas-jefferson-hs-students-protest-demand-diploma-murdered-classmate/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbc12.com/2022/03/22/thomas-jefferson-hs-students-protest-demand-diploma-murdered-classmate/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3qPmITsGihCPiAwlByp-l4" target="_blank">NBC 12</a>, so she said he should also receive the diploma.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Adams thought a line in the state code could be used for an exception to the requirements. But she said her appeals to the school division superintendent, governor and secretary of education were unsuccessful.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As the bill progressed, Adams said she heard from other families who were thankful for the bill, which unanimously passed both chambers of the General Assembly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amber Holsinger-Staton is the mother of Nicholas Coleman, a Prince George High School student who died in August 2021, right before his senior year started. Coleman was diagnosed with brain cancer a year prior. He completed work through an <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/special-education/iep-instruction/individualized-education-program-iep" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/special-education/iep-instruction/individualized-education-program-iep&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw309OYEWl0Imd5tnZw9QQfF" target="_blank">individualized education program</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“He was very sick and he did what he could,” Holsinger-Staton said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Her family did not get the closure they deserved at Coleman’s would-be graduation, she said. The school told Holsinger-Staton that graduation was a time for celebration and they did not want it to be a memorial, which she said upset Coleman’s peers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">School administrators sometimes worry that commemorative activities could upset students and staff, according to the <a href="https://grievingstudents.org/about-us/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://grievingstudents.org/about-us/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0WNBv0lReDgFfYcSm65vIG" target="_blank">Coalition</a> to Support Grieving Students, a part of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement. But the death itself is what upsets students most, not discussions about the death, according to the coalition, which argues students need to be allowed to plan the activities to honor their lost friends as part of the grief process.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I get that graduation is a time of celebration, but these kids also lost somebody,” Holsinger-Staton said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Peers can heal through the honoring of deceased students, Adams stated. Commemoration would “add to the occasion and make it more meaningful for all.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After Coleman’s girlfriend went to <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/06/08/prince-george-community-pushes-back-after-pghs-may-not-leave-seat-graduation-late-student/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbc12.com/2022/06/08/prince-george-community-pushes-back-after-pghs-may-not-leave-seat-graduation-late-student/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0EDmycgr5lMpvj7xfKrnUC" target="_blank">the news</a>, Prince George High School offered to leave a seat with flowers and a cap and gown for Coleman at his would-be graduation. Students also had a moment of silence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Holsinger-Staton was denied what she really wanted — an honorary diploma. The diploma would have given her some closure, she said, adding something should be in place for students who die junior or senior year. She also believes it would be beneficial if the bill was retroactive.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The bill could be expanded to other high school grade levels in the future, Adams stated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“If nothing else, for the families going forward, I think it’s the most important thing,” Holsinger-Staton said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tammy Gweedo McGee’s son Conner Guido died in a car crash on the night of his homecoming dance in October 2019. He was a junior. His mother adapted the spelling of her last name to reflect her son’s nickname, “Gweedo.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Guido maintained a 3.7 GPA and was active in many school sports at Tabb High School in Yorktown. It was “heart-wrenching,” she said, to know he could not graduate with his friends.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gweedo McGee hopes “parents who have been robbed of the opportunity to see their child at graduation” can benefit from posthumous diplomas, as well as empty chairs at graduation to honor their children.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The school had a celebration of life for Guido on the school soccer field. There were other recognitions that Gweedo McGee requested. She asked to pay for a bench on the soccer field or to plant a tree in her son’s honor, but the school told her they wanted to be consistent with commemorative actions, she said. A friend of Guido’s was also denied a request to allow “honor tassels” similar to club tassels like the National Honors Society and Key Club.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Coalition to Support Grieving Students <a href="https://www.schoolcrisiscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Guidelines-Graduation-Commemoration.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.schoolcrisiscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Guidelines-Graduation-Commemoration.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw25WM4eRpSy6YhlvEydZDzv" target="_blank">suggests</a> commemorative actions such as reading names at graduation, possibly followed by a moment of silence, or the designation of a yearbook page in honor of the student. The coalition suggested schools avoid things like <a href="https://www.schoolcrisiscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Guidelines-Death-Student-or-Staff-Booklet-Format.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.schoolcrisiscenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Guidelines-Death-Student-or-Staff-Booklet-Format.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Q5cFGe75_3EZUbVg9-7Q7" target="_blank">naming buildings</a>, planting trees or placing plaques in school hallways to honor students if they are unable to apply these measures consistently to future deaths.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The school ultimately offered memorial pins for students to wear on their caps and gowns, but they would not allow an empty seat at graduation in case it retraumatized students, Gweedo McGee said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not sure that there’s a great adjective for the pain that I felt inflicted upon me unnecessarily by a simple request to honor my deceased son at what would have been his graduation,” she said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Any student who dies in good standing should be recognized, Gweedo McGee said. She was disappointed in the school district, she added, but turned to advocacy to make a difference.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gweedo McGee has helped pass two bills. <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB78" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221%2Bsum%2BSB78&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3OXK5QQHOatYQF3qY2uIci" target="_blank">Senate Bill 78</a> required an additional 90-minute parent and student driver education component to the classroom portion of its driver education program. The <a href="https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/#cdts/90min.asp" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/drivers/%23cdts/90min.asp&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0GNESGuAbWlpSKAIPpofdq" target="_blank">requirement </a>is for the Northern Virginia area but encouraged outside of that planning district. The bill also requires education around the dangers of distracted driving.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB1918&amp;212+sum+HB1918" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212%2Bsum%2BHB1918%26212%2Bsum%2BHB1918&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1oR4wKGw1F_JZzxb6Jzpvn" target="_blank">HB 1918</a> requires driver education to cover the dangers of distracted driving and speeding. It also requires students to provide evidence of a valid driver’s license when applying for a school parking permit, and a standardized application form was created.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gweedo McGee also created a <a href="https://ifyouseesomethingsaysomething.org/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ifyouseesomethingsaysomething.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1684259607901000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1NqN4Ut-fzdPVb-hL151K4" target="_blank">website</a> to allow teenagers to anonymously report unsafe behavior of peers in an effort to save lives.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“While I’m left on this Earth, I will never stop honoring my son and using his tragedy to help others,” Gweedo McGee said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">She selected some eggs, milk, frozen Kid Cuisines and other items for the week and headed for the checkout line. She swiped a plastic card for payment, like most customers do, but unlike other customers she used an electronic benefit transfer card, known as food stamp benefits.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The benefits are a huge help on a low income, Leftwich said, adding, “You feel overwhelmed and stressed trying to run a household on your own and make sure your child has everything they need.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food stamp benefits that can be used like cash to buy groceries from authorized retailers, according to the <a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/benefit/snap.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dss.virginia.gov/benefit/snap.cgi&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Af1oXh1a6D7kxexYviI9B">Virginia Department of Social Services.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The emergency allotments increased existing monthly benefits to the maximum amount based on household size, not income limits. The program in April 2020 gave $95 extra to households that received the monthly maximum, according to the <a href="https://www.dss.virginia.gov/benefit/emergency_allotments.cgi" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dss.virginia.gov/benefit/emergency_allotments.cgi&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-Ucu4sSeWSYfFg7FGlZCx">Virginia Department of Social Services</a>. Congress passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3FiKMv_3oBKn7bBu-KtEm0">Consolidated Appropriations Act</a> this year, which ended emergency allotments after the last February distribution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was able to help me get more food and larger amounts for me and my child,” Leftwich said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some families are finding now they do not have enough to cover food expenses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Being a single mother is hard; sometimes you don’t have other resources,” Leftwich said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leftwich likes to buy half a gallon of milk at the grocery store but said it seems to go pretty quickly. She has turned to other resources to help feed her daughter and stretch out the food stamp allotment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Food banks in Roanoke said they are helping more residents — from young mothers to veterans to senior citizens — after the extra benefits ended. But the food banks also face a decrease in donations due to rising food costs and lack of funds to buy more costly food.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Food banks see need increase</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Christian Soldiers Food Pantry of Roanoke is a partner agency of Feeding America, according to Rayma Mills, director and manager of the food pantry. The pantry started 25 years ago from the back of a pickup truck with two pastors, according to Mills, and now occupies a large area upstairs in an old industrial building. They receive donations almost daily from Food Lion, Kroger, Walmart and Sam’s Club.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On an early Friday morning in April, visitors shopped the pantry and chose from shelves stacked with produce, meat, dry goods, bread, desserts and more. That day rotisserie chicken was also offered.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We serve clients Tuesday through Saturday,” Mills said. “They can come one time a week.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">More people have come to the food bank since emergency allotments ended, according to Mills. They serve thousands of people a year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They’ve taken benefits away, but they’re not putting a net there for nobody,” Mills said. The food pantry helps people who “fall through the cracks.”</p>
<p><iframe title="A look at poverty level throughout Virginia" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-a90aD" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/a90aD/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="508" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</script></p>
<p dir="ltr">“I have people coming through here that say if they could not come to this pantry, they would not be able to eat, and I know it’s the absolute truth,” Mills said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Friendship House has operated for 85 years, according to owner Aaron Dowdy. In addition to a food pantry, the house runs an after-school program for elementary school children and a housing program for refugees and immigrants, Dowdy said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve had several families mention that’s the reason why they’re coming more often now,” Dowdy said about the end of emergency SNAP benefits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Friendship House served approximately 115 families a week before 2023. The organization now serves approximately 150 families a week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pantry gives each family at least two grocery bags of food. One bag has canned goods and the other has fresh food, according to Dowdy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Food banks struggle to help those in need</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">United Christian Inner-City Ministry Food Distribution Center of Roanoke has served the community for 23 years, according to owner Billie English.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Food Distribution Center has had an increase in phone calls since emergency benefits ended, but also due to the rising price of food products, English said. The center also serves people who don’t receive SNAP benefits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of donations to the center has decreased due to the increase in food prices, according to English.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our donations have gone down because people are having to spend more money to buy food,” English said. “They’re not able to help donate so that we can go get food.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Feeding America is a network of food pantries and food banks around the U.S., with seven main locations in Virginia. It <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/hunger-crisis-worsens#:~:text=Feeding%20America%20projects%20that%20the,overall%20food%20donations%20are%20down." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/hunger-crisis-worsens%23:~:text%3DFeeding%2520America%2520projects%2520that%2520the,overall%2520food%2520donations%2520are%2520down.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0eg-ZUrAPqe7LVjx3y6zcj">projected</a> a 20% decrease in donations from manufacturers and a 45% decrease in “federal commodities” for last year. The organization stated last year that 55% of its food banks reported a decrease in donations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Food banks now have to purchase more food to keep up with need but are paying higher costs, according to Feeding America. The organization estimated a 40% increase in food costs last year.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Rising food costs</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The U.S. Department of Agriculture <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/#:~:text=Egg%20prices%20are%20predicted%20to,experienced%20consistent%20growth%20throughout%202022." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/%23:~:text%3DEgg%2520prices%2520are%2520predicted%2520to,experienced%2520consistent%2520growth%2520throughout%25202022.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PYB9o-KsfONOkb2y5NzWU">forecast</a> the price of eggs would increase almost 30% this year. Other categories would increase in price also, including meats, poultry, dairy, fats and oils, processed fruits and vegetables, sugar and sweets, and cereals and bakery products.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Food prices are anticipated to increase more slowly this year but remain at above-historical average rates, <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20all%20food%20prices,of%204.5%20to%2011.7%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-price-outlook/summary-findings/%23:~:text%3DIn%25202023%252C%2520all%2520food%2520prices,of%25204.5%2520to%252011.7%2520percent.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw12YfFLT4UD11xrgIFXDq8r">according to the USDA</a>, which predicted a 7.5% increase in all food costs this year for the U.S. The Consumer Price Index, a measure of economy-wide inflation, was up 6% in February from last February. Grocery store food prices increased by over 10% from February this year to February 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many people in the region do not have the extra money to spare.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The poverty level is an annual income of $14,580 or less for a household of one person in Virginia. The poverty level increases by $5,140 for each additional person in a household of eight, according to the <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/10/2023/01/FY-2023FPL_500NVM.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/10/2023/01/FY-2023FPL_500NVM.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_xpGQxlPfrRd2hJ2Y1afj">Virginia Department of Health</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over 18% of households in Roanoke live in poverty. The median Roanoke household income, in dollars adjusted for inflation, is under $49,000, according to data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/roanokecityvirginia/LND110220" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/roanokecityvirginia/LND110220&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682634926592000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0zZt_FX4VBeTW-AxldmrA8">U.S. Census Bureau.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Food is a necessary but significant expense, Leftwich said. Local food banks are beneficial for single mothers like her, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The food bank has helped me get things I need because the food prices have gone up,” Leftwich said. “They helped me get access to nutritious foods like fresh produce and helped me reduce a financial burden.”</p>

This rate would continue to increase incrementally until 2027, when it reached Virginia minimum wage. The slow increase is meant to help employers adjust, according to Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, who introduced the measure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hope’s bill passed the House unanimously on a block vote, meaning it was not discussed prior to voting. The bill passed the Senate 22-18.</p>

It would remove the incremental pay bumps of the original bill.

<p dir="ltr">Any currently certified employer would be grandfathered in until 2030, but no new certificates would be issued after July 1.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The national average for workers being paid subminimum wage is $3.34 an hour, according to a U.S. Commission on Civil Rights <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/files/2020/2020-09-17-Subminimum-Wages-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.usccr.gov/files/2020/2020-09-17-Subminimum-Wages-Report.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2SJ9rt97qEGGTJ9bTDb8Si">2020 report</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Resources such as job coaches, at-home work and self-employment render the certificate exemption no longer necessary, Shapiro said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What kind of Virginia do we want to be?” Shapiro said. “Do we want to be one that pays people fairly for the work that they do, and at good wages? Or are we OK saying we’re going to pay somebody $10 a week?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thirteen states already have legislation in place to prevent employers from paying subminimum wage, according to the APSE study. Reforms are also being attempted <a href="https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/transformation_to_competitive_integrated_employment_act.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/transformation_to_competitive_integrated_employment_act.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OhF4dSq_V32mb_Zl55lqC">at the federal level</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is a very demoralizing issue, and it shouldn’t really be an issue in the 21st century,” said Charlotte Woodward, the <a href="https://ndss.org/Virginia-HB-1924" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ndss.org/Virginia-HB-1924&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3BFL5Gco8VFQW8x_IcvwCk">National Down Syndrome Society</a>’s education program associate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Woodward was born with Down syndrome, she said. Her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ndssorg/video/6858333590355201286" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/@ndssorg/video/6858333590355201286&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3-Q5DdmdGYizVBDqNxHgud">advocacy work</a> is important to her because she believes disabled voices provide needed visibility, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The doctor told my mom I would never learn to read or write,” Woodward said. “That, when I grew up, I would work in a sheltered workshop.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A sheltered workshop is traditionally <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0302101270" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0302101270&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0UAWsi2uQULvPEojzHMsGF">defined</a> as a supervised workplace for adults who have a physical or intellectual disability.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Of course, my mom didn’t take those words to heart,” Woodward added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Opponents of the bill question if sheltered workshops and subminimum wage are harmful to disabled workers. Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-Williamsburg, spoke to the Senate about the disabled son of his former administrative assistant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He never once, never once, mentioned how much he was paid or what the compensation was,” Norment said. “It was the intangible reward and satisfaction and fulfillment of his day that he got going to work.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Jill Vogel, R-Fauquier, also opposed the bill. It would take away opportunities for employers to provide “a haven, a place, a job for people where they do not pay them minimum wage,” she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Almost all of the workers originally employed under Melwood’s former certificate are still employed by the organization, but now at “full wage,” Cosgrove said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s about recognizing that our employees’ voices, and their desire for that full wage, brought that dignity — brought that stability,” Cosgrove said. “It improved our employee morale immediately.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">To assume disabled workers will thrive in sheltered production does not account for individual ability and interest, said Tonya Milling, executive director of The Arc of Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Think of it as the same way you approach things in your own life,” Milling said. “When I looked for a job, I looked for something that matched my skills, matched my abilities and could hold my interest.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shapiro sympathized with concerns over disabled workers and their well-being.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There is a ‘dignity of risk’ argument that can be made here,” Shapiro said. “Are we going to allow [them] to go out into the world and break a nail? Or are we going to keep [them] in a bubble their entire lives?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Virginia Department of Aging and Rehabilitative Services plans to aid transitioning employers with nearly $14 million in provided federal funding, according to the <a href="https://www.dlcv.org/employment-feb-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dlcv.org/employment-feb-23&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680807933396000&amp;usg=AOvVaw31SQvRdeQywOoEt2mHu5P9">Disability Law Center of Virginia</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Youngkin’s amendment, in addition to codifying the funds, would require DARS to report to the governor’s office in 2024 about the transition away from certificates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers will vote on Youngkin’s changes when they reconvene on April 12.</p>

The state curriculum needs to delve into threading education more thoroughly, Burton said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s like it was just stuck in there, but no meat to the threading,” Burton said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler, D-Virginia Beach, introduced<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1498" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231%2Bsum%2BHB1498&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680202171776000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3vB-plACq0YUBpxGhOfV8C"> House Bill 1498 </a>to remove the requirement that an eyebrow threader must obtain an occupational license.

<p dir="ltr">Convirs-Fowler did not return multiple calls and emails for a statement about the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DPOR did not bring the bill to the General Assembly, and declined to comment on the legislation when contacted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meagan Forbes, director of legislation and senior legislative counsel for the Arlington-based Institute for Justice, testified to the subcommittee panel on behalf of the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “Threading is a safe hair removal technique,” Forbes said. “It does not involve chemicals or dangerous devices, threaders simply use their hands and a single piece of cotton thread to remove hairs.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Twenty states currently exempt threading “without issue,” according to Forbes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Zahra Lakhani, a DPOR-licensed educator, recently retired after doing eyebrow threading for approximately 30 years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It would be a step backwards to remove the license requirement for threading, she said. The education an eyebrow threader receives through instruction is important, Lakhani said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s very important to know the sanitary part of it, how to keep yourself safe, how to keep your customer safe, how to do the practice well and well skilled,” Lakhnai said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Sanitization is essential for threading because technicians roll the thread on the clients’ faces, which could cause cross-contamination, according to Lakhani.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Rolling the thread cuts or burns the skin if the skin is not tight and held a specific way while removing hair from your face, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “The consumer and the provider should always be protected,” Lakhani said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the waxing education requirement was removed, Lakhani thinks at least 60 hours of threading training would be “sufficient,” and should include sanitation training, theory and practice hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stefania Rafeedie, who owns Arch and Beauty Studio LLC in Fairfax County, <a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File=meeting%5C134%5C32616%5CAgenda_DPOR_32616_v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/GetFile.cfm?File%3Dmeeting%255C134%255C32616%255CAgenda_DPOR_32616_v1.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1680202171777000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3XKFuTNjkvMx4Or0eaqkbn">wrote</a> DPOR to request an “Eyebrow Specialist” license in 2021, according to the letter accessed from the regulatory agency. More specific training is needed to provide specialized eyebrow treatments, according to Rafeedie.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is puzzling to me that while one of the above licenses are required, none of them teach a future practitioner how to perform these services,” Rafeedie stated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There are still some spots remaining in a new academic program that aims to support Virginia public school students after the impact of COVID-19 on education, although a majority have been filled.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Virginia Department of Education and Graduation Alliance launched &#8220;ENGAGE Virginia&#8221; last month. ENGAGE Virginia will help students with learning and attendance issues after the effects of the pandemic, according to a <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/Home/Components/News/News/268/227" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doe.virginia.gov/Home/Components/News/News/268/227&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1679427424462000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3HBzRFObk8fgWalAvKkTQL">VDOE press release</a>. It will “supplement efforts already underway in schools to meet the needs of students still struggling with academic, attendance and mental health issues,” stated Jillian Balow in a <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/Home/Components/News/News/268/227" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doe.virginia.gov/Home/Components/News/News/268/227&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1679427424462000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3HBzRFObk8fgWalAvKkTQL">press release</a>.

<p dir="ltr">The program is state-funded and free to the public, according to ENGAGE Virginia’s <a href="https://registerva.graduationalliance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://registerva.graduationalliance.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1679427424463000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2eXpsyHRk8JaBvSFbii7Z9">website</a>. Families who sign up will be assigned an academic success coach, according to its website. The coaches will help students in ways like how to focus on their schoolwork, create resumes and refer students to local social-emotional support nonprofits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The VDOE Office of School Quality is in charge of overseeing ENGAGE Virginia, according to Aurelia Ortiz, director of school quality. This office “helps schools with school improvement,” Ortiz said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The General Assembly designated $3.5 million for academic assistance to the VDOE during the 2022 session, according to Ortiz. After the pandemic, the VDOE had many concerns around student displacement, Ortiz said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“After the pandemic we knew that divisions had concerns, which we were aware of, with student engagement, with chronic absenteeism, students that had fallen off the roster, students that they could not locate,” Ortiz said. “Students can’t be successful if they aren’t in school.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Forty-two school divisions reached out to ENGAGE Virginia to sign students up, while 30 school divisions officially partnered with ENGAGE Virginia, according to Ortiz. Over 11,000 program spots have been filled out of the allotted 15,000, Ortiz said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These spots are “tentatively taken” by the school divisions, which means each division’s needs vary depending on its size, Ortiz said. Parents can also reach out to their child&#8217;s school to ask for academic help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As long as there are seats available — which as of right now you can see by the numbers there are seats available — then they [families] would be eligible for the program as well,” Ortiz said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">ENGAGE Virginia offers a human resource in schools where those resources are lacking, whether that be through a social worker or school counselor, according to Ortiz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“A social worker would make a referral for community services, the counselor would offer mental health support, a teacher would provide homework assistance,” Ortiz said. “ENGAGE Virginia will do all of those things wrapped into one to meet the needs of the families.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The impact of the program should be multilayered, through mental and academic support and the link to community resources, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">COVID-19 created the largest disruption of education systems in history, according to a United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2020/08/sg_policy_brief_covid-19_and_education_august_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dspd/wp-content/uploads/sites/22/2020/08/sg_policy_brief_covid-19_and_education_august_2020.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1679427424463000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3dgQHLAozq4wkZyrFOkc_9">policy brief</a> released in August 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Parent Courtney Dean&#8217;s family had a hard time adjusting to the pandemic, according to Dean. Dean&#8217;s two children, 11th grader Carter and eighth grader Stella, are enrolled in Chesterfield County Public Schools, according to Dean.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pandemic was “challenging” for Dean’s children, she said. It was tough for them academically, but they also missed out on a lot of “lasts,” Dean said. Her two children’s fifth and eighth grade school years were cut short by the pandemic, and they missed out on end-of-year events.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“She [Stella] was doing fine as far as learning in the virtual world at first,” Dean said. “But she had a really hard time focusing and paying attention to virtual because it&#8217;s so much more interesting to look around your bedroom and, you know, mess with things. … Many times I would find her asleep because she could.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stella also had issues with her Spanish class once she transferred back to in-person classes, Dean said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Stella advanced to the next level Spanish class but is retaking it because she needed a better foundation, Dean said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“She started that when she was virtual and then it went back to a hybrid thing where the teacher was trying to teach both the kids that were there in person, like my daughter, as well as the kids who were at home,” Dean said. “For my daughter, it just didn&#8217;t work … to no fault of the teacher; it was brand new for everybody and she was doing her best.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dean’s son, Carter, dealt with more of an “emotional struggle,” she said. He worked over 12 hours a day on homework, from 7 a.m. to midnight, once things went virtual, according to Dean.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He got to the point where he was just so exhausted from it,” Dean said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Virginia firefighters will be required to complete a training program starting next year about the risk of electric vehicle fires.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, proposed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2451&amp;231+sum+HB2451" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231%2Bsum%2BHB2451%26231%2Bsum%2BHB2451&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1678378448213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0xDVLFar1vqvrrck--4Ba6">House Bill 2451</a> to require the executive director of the <a href="https://www.vafire.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vafire.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1678378448213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw170_n7hqlq-afNvOz6S1hA">Virginia Department of Fire Programs</a> to develop a training program for electric vehicle fires. The program must be developed and available by July, 1, 2024, according to the bill. All firefighters, including volunteer firefighters, must complete the training by Dec. 1, 2025.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill unanimously passed committees and both chambers. Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, asked for one clarification in the Senate General Laws and Technology Committee, about whether the program would be offered both in-person and virtual.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I heard from some of my fire folks, and they were concerned that this is more time away,” Reeves said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A lot of the annual firefighter training is done online, according to Reeves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spencer Willett, government affairs manager for the Virginia Department of Fire Programs, assured the Senate committee the training would be offered in multiple modalities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The agency’s plan would be to offer an online version for departments and then also offer an in-person version for those that would be willing to want to take that training,” Willett said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of electric vehicles on Virginia’s roadways is set to increase with the soon-to-be implemented <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/virginia/vp-nw-cns-clean-car-law-20230216-wazfi67pjzcv5e6am3njrek3nq-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.pilotonline.com/government/virginia/vp-nw-cns-clean-car-law-20230216-wazfi67pjzcv5e6am3njrek3nq-story.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1678378448213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw06RXlmNmIbzDNg9V0srHPu">Clean Car law</a>. The law states 35% of all new cars and trucks sold in Virginia with a 2026 model year must be electric. Then 100% of new models on the market must be electric by 2035, according to the law, which is based on <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/barcu/regact/2022/accii/2acciifro1962.4.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/barcu/regact/2022/accii/2acciifro1962.4.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1678378448213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Gch8j5-K-IttDAOjvtS3f">California&#8217;s final regulation order</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Mike Cherry, R-Colonial Heights, a co-patron of the bill, said it is important to implement mandated training statewide, even for areas like Southwest Virginia where electric vehicles aren&#8217;t prominent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Anytime a fire department deals with something new and unique, they will then figure out a protocol to deal with it again in the future,” Cherry said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is currently no mandated electric vehicle training for Virginia firefighters, according to William Boger, District 5 vice president and communications director for the <a href="https://www.vpff.org/about-us-2/who-are-we/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpff.org/about-us-2/who-are-we/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1678378448213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw02cwE1YpAWUF9k6g-3zLC7">Virginia Professional Fire Fighters</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, departments can currently seek out training from car manufacturers like <a href="https://www.tesla.com/firstresponders" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tesla.com/firstresponders&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1678378448213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FuNzOMjrny9lMhHE9MvAa">Tesla</a> or Toyota, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The future training program will greatly help firefighters better understand electric vehicle fires and the best ways to extinguish them, according to Boger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Firefighters use approximately 50 gallons to 100 gallons of water to extinguish a regular internal combustion engine, or gasoline, vehicle fire, while electric vehicles require about 10,000 gallons of water, according to Boger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They are very stubborn and very difficult to extinguish,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Most electric vehicles carry large lithium-ion<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6eS6JzBn0k&amp;t=4s" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DJ6eS6JzBn0k%26t%3D4s&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1678378448213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1MhkCpKxs2F5T0ntBAe8Wn"> battery packs</a> underneath the vehicle, where they are not very accessible. These batteries can overheat, which leads to a reaction called <a href="https://ul.org/research/electrochemical-safety/getting-started-electrochemical-safety/what-thermal-runaway" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ul.org/research/electrochemical-safety/getting-started-electrochemical-safety/what-thermal-runaway&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1678378448213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3x8cSUKTfG8SRUfpkHOrNh">thermal runaway</a> and requires thousands of gallons of water, according to Boger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Firefighters also need to be aware that the battery is not necessarily finished burning just because the fire is finally put out, according to Boger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The problem with these cars is you have to put the fire out, then you have to continuously cool the battery,” Boger said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some electric vehicle batteries will reignite on the way to a junkyard if the battery is not properly cooled down and observed after the fire is put out, according to Boger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some batteries can even catch fire two to three days later, according to Doug Reynolds, battalion chief of the Henrico County Division of Fire.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“You may have to have several tankers bringing you water, so it&#8217;s not the easy, you know, fire that it used to be,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dry chemicals and fire blankets have been used, but are not considered as effective as water, according to Boger.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Andrew Klock, senior manager of education and development with the <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/EV" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nfpa.org/EV&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1678378448213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2UsMTtgxNolorBFKXJKpy2">National Fire Protection Association</a>, said the best recommendation is still water.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s the most effective to date and if it&#8217;s placed in the proper location, it can put out the fire and drain the heat from the battery pack,” Klock said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Electric vehicle fires are not more threatening than gasoline vehicle fires, which occur every three minutes, Klock said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But I do think that the risk and the inherent problem is that firefighters have had 100 years to figure out and perfect how to put out an internal combustion engine vehicle [fire],” Klock said. “But it&#8217;s not so with this new technology or newer technology of hybrid and electric vehicles.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reynolds’ department looks forward to seeing the curriculum and learning everything they can about this unique type of vehicle fire, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It affects every firefighter, you know, from paid to volunteer, big departments, small departments, you know, the car fires are out there every day,” Reynolds said. “So it&#8217;s just better to protect us to learn how to fight those fires because it&#8217;s important.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Virginia Department of Fire Programs will develop the training program, utilizing fire experts and industry representatives, according to Will Merritt, VDFP marketing and communications manager.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A workgroup will create the curriculum in concert with VDFP staff, Merritt stated via email. The curriculum is then “piloted, finalized and posted for registration in VDFP&#8217;s learning management system, Cornerstone OnDemand,” he stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As electric vehicles become more popular, it is important that Virginia’s fire service be adequately trained to fight electric-vehicle fires,” Merritt stated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Virginia students are returning to K-12 public schools — although enrollment has not returned to pre-pandemic levels — but there are fewer teachers due to an increase in teacher vacancies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rebound comes after an enrollment decline the previous two years.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fall membership data</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Enrollment numbers increased by more than 11,300 students from fall 2021 to fall 2022, according to <a href="https://p1pe.doe.virginia.gov/apex/f?p=180:1:::::p_session_id,p_application_name:-5222027055167779422,fallmembership" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://p1pe.doe.virginia.gov/apex/f?p%3D180:1:::::p_session_id,p_application_name:-5222027055167779422,fallmembership&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1677613751568000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0ndejHA1YSnkfJ7zzKruIN">data</a> from the Virginia Department of Education.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VDOE annually collects statistics on the number of students enrolled in public school on Sept. 30. This report, known as “Fall Membership,” is submitted by each school in Virginia that officially enrolls students.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia K-12 enrollment sits at just over 1.26 million full- and part-time students combined. Part-time students are nonpublic school students who take one or more classes in a public school, according to VDOE.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> The numbers show schools haven&#8217;t reached the 2019-20, pre-pandemic level of almost 1.3 million students.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of current part-time students decreased by over 100 students since the last school year. There was a significant increase of over 500 part-time students in the 2020-21 school year, while numbers fluctuated in prior years with no apparent trend.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of homeschooled students, including religious exemptions, <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/data-reports/statistics-reports/enrollment-demographics/home-schooled-students-religious-exemptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doe.virginia.gov/data-policy-funding/data-reports/statistics-reports/enrollment-demographics/home-schooled-students-religious-exemptions&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1677613751568000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2fauM564MRbKC9gA7Sura2">decreased</a> for the current school year, down 8% at almost 57,000 students. The previous two school years saw a spike in total homeschooled students, reaching over 65,500 homeschooled students in the 2020-21 school year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The category with the most homeschooled and religious-exempt students is K-5, accounting for almost half of the total.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Teacher vacancies</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There was a 25% increase in teacher vacancies throughout Virginia from the 2021 fall report to the 2022 fall VDOE report. The number of vacancies increased from just over 2,800 to over 3,500, <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/teaching-in-virginia/education-workforce-data-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching-learning-assessment/teaching-in-virginia/education-workforce-data-reports&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1677613751568000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3IwQMY30s_rm4IUPcEd-v3">according to the data,</a> which does not include personnel or transportation positions. The numbers may have changed, as they pertain to a snapshot of data from fall 2022, because school divisions do not report daily, weekly or monthly data on unfilled positions, according to the VDOE.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There was a 12% increase in teachers leaving the workforce in the 2021-22 school year when compared to the pre-pandemic yearly average, according to a Nov. 2022 <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt568.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt568.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1677613751568000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3DYgnSFD39O0HsED_vp3aQ">report</a> published by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, or JLARC. At the same time, there was a 15% decrease in newly licensed teachers, according to JLARC.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/07/virginia-report-shows-more-teachers-leaving-the-workforce-than-entering-it/" target="_blank"><em>[Read more: Virginia report shows more teachers leaving the workforce than entering it]</em></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">As more teachers leave the profession, fewer teachers are being licensed, according to the JLARC report. Nearly all divisions surveyed for the report indicated that finding “fully qualified applicants” was among their biggest challenges when it came to staffing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Richmond Education Association and other organizations have lobbied for better education funding and met with state lawmakers to provide support for educators, according to REA President Katina Harris.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are a few changes that will help increase enrollment, according to Harris, and lawmakers need to commit necessary funding. Students will receive a better education with smaller classroom sizes, more available counselors and more teacher support for remedial learning programs, Harris said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At minimum, $1.3 billion is needed to fully fund our [Richmond City] schools right now,” Harris said. “That shouldn’t be that hard to ask because the children are literally the future.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond allotted just over $200 million in general funds for education in the 2023 fiscal year, according to the city’s <a href="https://rva.gov/sites/default/files/2022-08/FY2023%20Adopted%20Annual%20Fiscal%20Plan%20-%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rva.gov/sites/default/files/2022-08/FY2023%2520Adopted%2520Annual%2520Fiscal%2520Plan%2520-%2520FINAL.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1677613751568000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2U7B5LOm17mE3NYlsDdljv">budget</a>. The city has also budgeted $200 million in capital improvement funds for school modernization and improvement for the upcoming 2024 fiscal year.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Homeschooler appeal</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The pandemic contributed to the increase of homeschooled students, according to Yvonne Bunn, the director of homeschool support and government affairs for the Home Educators Association of Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There was an almost 56% increase in total homeschooled students in the 2020-21 school year. The amount of K-5 homeschooled students doubled that year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many parents have chosen to continue homeschooling even since schools reopened. Parents can tailor their children&#8217;s education to their needs, according to Bunn.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The home environment is safer for children who deal with bullying or harassment in public schools, Bunn said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It takes them out of that where they can be in their home, they can be more secure in their home,” Bunn said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Homeschooling in Virginia allows parents to meet their children where they are, rather than children struggling to keep up in schools, according to Bunn.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If they got average or below average, we&#8217;d go back over it to see how they could understand the material better,” Bunn said. “So that&#8217;s the key to homeschooling, one-on-one tutoring, that&#8217;s really the key.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Commonwealth University student Celia Donnelly is a senior studying graphic design. Homeschooling allowed her time to pursue her interests, which eventually led to her current studies, she said. Donnelly was homeschooled from K-12 in North Carolina, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Parents can provide resources, such as curriculums that adapt to specific learning styles, that are not readily available in public school, or are not as standardized, according to Donnelly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s all standardized, you have a lot of people who need a lot of things, so just inherently there’s going to be a lot of gaps … and homeschooling can help with that,” she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Donnelly’s mother valued and through homeschool taught her the ability to “question everything and stay curious” about the world around her, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislation and funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia lawmakers allotted $3.2 billion in <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/june/name-935061-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/june/name-935061-en.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1677613751568000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1HRuWnuThGNcbxMvkExpZa">direct aid for state education</a> in the 2022-24 biennium budget. The budget also included reforms for a 10% teacher pay raise split over two years.

<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers have introduced proposals during the current General Assembly session to tackle the deficit of teachers, as well as the increasing number of homeschooled students.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1566" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231%2Bsum%2BHB1566&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1677613751568000&amp;usg=AOvVaw198hVDTgpOLopO2Tm1ORC0">House Bill 1566</a>, which would require the state to pay educators a rate equal to or above the national average salary for teachers. The bill reported from a House committee but did not advance from the Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. John McGuire III, R-Goochland, proposed HB 1454. The <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1454" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D231%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb1454&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1677613751568000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3CCTBUOJE27WMqqWywdANZ">bill</a> would have eliminated the four criteria needed for parents and guardians to homeschool their children.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia laws currently require that homeschooling educators must hold a high school diploma, be qualified by the Board of Education, provide children with a program that can be delivered through distance learning or provide evidence that they have an ability to provide adequate education. A House education subcommittee killed the measure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Marie March, R-Floyd, proposed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1475" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D231%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb1475&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1677613751568000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2sYQcNn1S7PykT2tirNFKi">HB 1475</a>, which would prohibit schools from joining interscholastic organizations that would not allow homeschooled students. Similar versions <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/02/25/lawmakers-again-debate-allowing-home-schooled-students-play-public-school-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbc12.com/2022/02/25/lawmakers-again-debate-allowing-home-schooled-students-play-public-school-sports/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1677613751568000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Jzy6EsUCvavTE18NUZhJN">of the bill</a> to allow homeschooled students to play sports have been introduced for years. The bill passed an education subcommittee but was defeated in committee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">State budget amendments currently under debate by lawmakers also proposed an increase in education spending, according to a report by <a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-02-07/general-assembly-2023-budget-proposals" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-02-07/general-assembly-2023-budget-proposals&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1677613751568000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2-yyAIfo6v7h15G0d4Hv-o">VPM.</a> Additionally, House and Senate versions include a 2% salary increase that would extend to K-12 educators.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A pony has been the Chincoteague High School mascot as long as anyone can remember, but now it is headed for a bigger arena as the official state pony.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Two Accomack lawmakers introduced bills to designate the Chincoteague pony as the state pony. Virginia will be the 18th state in the country to have an equine member as a state symbol, according to the State Symbols USA <a href="https://statesymbolsusa.org/categories/state-horse" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://statesymbolsusa.org/categories/state-horse&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1676749088799000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2lga0yC2Wb_WtL6XuOTzqU">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Robert Bloxom Jr., R-Accomack, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1951" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D231%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb1951&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1676749088799000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3YpOyza18VViKjCE6b7cgB">House Bill 1951</a>, and Sen. Lynwood Lewis, D-Accomack, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB1478" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D231%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3DSB1478&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1676749088799000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0R1KBabzDJlTYQl3Ss3ua6">Senate Bill 1478</a>. The Senate measure crossed the finish line first on Friday, Feb. 17 in a unanimous House block vote, despite mention of the ponies in Grayson Highlands State Park.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The recognition for these horses is long overdue, according to John Arthur Leonard, mayor of Chincoteague.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I mean, we&#8217;ve had worldwide recognition and now the state is finally stepping up and making it official,” the mayor said. “It gives us some pats on the back from the state because sometimes we get left off maps and other things, so it feels good to have some recognition from the state.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The wild ponies have been a part of the region almost “as long as the state has been settled,” the mayor said, “so they deserve it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some background: You may have heard of Assateague Island horses or ponies. That is where Chincoteague ponies come from, during an annual <a href="http://www.chincoteagueislandadventures.com/pony-swim.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.chincoteagueislandadventures.com/pony-swim.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1676749088799000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0u-Xc35yeDqcSC7w2Mp9AK">Pony Swim</a> that has trotted along for almost 100 years. The Assateague herd lives on land shared between Maryland and Virginia, according to the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/asis/learn/nature/horses.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nps.gov/asis/learn/nature/horses.htm&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1676749088799000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1nWQAoJNbdpcBnYQ-SqAmX">National Park Service</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most common origin story is that the horses were brought by way of Spanish galleons, according to the mayor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They were bringing horses back with them and a couple of the ships wrecked off our shores, and the horses swam ashore and it was just natural pasture for them,” the mayor said. “So they accepted it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The popular children&#8217;s book and true story of “Misty of Chincoteague,” written in 1947 by Marguerite Henry, helped bring appreciation toward the ponies, Bloxom said to House members.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The annual Pony Swim on the last Wednesday of every July is a way to control the herd. The week-long event draws crowds of over 50,000 people, Bloxom said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Co. takes care of the ponies with help from tourists, according to John Hunter Leonard, public relations officer for the station. That is in addition to providing fire and ambulance service to the island’s approximately 3,000 residents, Bloxom said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s been a beneficial relationship, mutually,” John Hunter Leonard said. “So therefore, we take very good care of them as best we can.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Co., along with a local high school student, were the ones to propose this idea of the state pony to Bloxom, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chincoteague ponies are an “economic driver” for Virginia, according to Bloxom. “It&#8217;s a wonderful tight-knit community … and this is just an extension of them, really,” Bloxom said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ponies are auctioned off each year during the Pony Swim. The event raised over $400,000 last year and helps fund the fire department and year-round care for the herd, according to Bloxom.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Chincoteague ponies are a main attraction for tourists, but they are also appreciated by locals, according to Randy Birch, who grew up in Chincoteague.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“At Chincoteague High School, the pony has been the mascot ever since I can remember,” Birch said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Birch owns Chincoteague Island Adventures, which takes visitors on boat tours to see ponies and local wildlife, in addition to duck hunting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It seems like every year, it’s escalated,” Birch said of the Pony Swim. “They’ve done real well with it.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ponies that are not auctioned off are rounded up and swim back to Assateague, according to Birch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Back in the day, after the auction, there would be some “bucking Bronco” rodeo action to see who could stay on a horse the longest and win a prize, Birch said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Because of liability reasons, they stopped that way back years ago,” Birch said — along with pony races at the carnival grounds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As for the wild ponies auctioned off, there doesn’t seem to be any buyer’s remorse, according to John Hunter Leonard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Everybody that takes them home says how trainable they are and how willing they are to work with people,” he said. “They seem to have a calm demeanor and they really accept children.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers showed overwhelming support for both bills. A few delegates voted against the House measure — and one even asked if the vote would be recorded as a “neigh.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wild ponies also roam in Grayson County, Del. William Wampler, R-Washington, pointed out during the bill’s second reading in the House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I would put my auction up against his auction, which I don’t believe there is one, any day,” Bloxom responded. “I would put my salt water cowboys herding up my herd far before they run wild in the mountains and never get herded up at all.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gov. Glenn Youngkin and first lady Suzanne Youngkin <a href="https://www.firstlady.virginia.gov/latest-news/news-releases/2022/october/first-lady-suzanne-s-youngkin-announces-october-2022-spirit-of-virginia-award-recipient.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.firstlady.virginia.gov/latest-news/news-releases/2022/october/first-lady-suzanne-s-youngkin-announces-october-2022-spirit-of-virginia-award-recipient.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1676749088799000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1_RCbY3zdhw4KNLRy3qSVv">have visited</a> Chincoteague Island a couple of times, the mayor said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“His wife really seems to like the ponies,” the mayor said. “We actually had her on a horse during pony penning.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The mayor said he hopes the Youngkins come back to “officially sign the bill.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Hopefully, he will do that in person on the island,” the mayor said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The decrease in benefits comes after Congress passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2617&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675977273384000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2u06wL_7xP_AMgY2mWGdtJ">Consolidated Appropriations Act</a>, which ended the additional allotments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Neighborhood Resource Center of Greater Fulton is a nonprofit organization that provides nutritional, financial and educational support to low-income individuals across Richmond, according to the <a href="https://nrccafe.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nrccafe.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675977273384000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Xn4YyYMDr8tbJnmPGVqMh">center</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Breanne Armbrust, executive director of the NRC, said she has seen firsthand how increased SNAP benefits impact the community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When benefits increase, there are less people who need food pantry bags, according to Armbrust.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It allows them to have some flexibility with their funds to be able to do other things that are just as essential as eating,” Armbrust said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The impact of reduced SNAP benefits is going to be “catastrophic,” in part due to the rising cost of food, according to Armbrust.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“With the inflation that’s happening that’s based on corporations raising prices of food, like the grocery stores raising prices, I just don’t know what people are supposed to do,” Armbrust said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It takes approximately six months for a person in economic struggle to be able to adjust their finances to offset the rising cost of expenses, according to Armbrust.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This notification is so last minute that I don’t believe it’s going to allow people to adjust their budgets to be able to prepare for that,” Armbrust said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia’s SNAP emergency allotments have been extended 34 times since the initial two-month request, according to the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/pandemic/covid-19/virginia#snap" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fns.usda.gov/disaster/pandemic/covid-19/virginia%23snap&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675977273384000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3G8vpAZc4w0PPb9o8PYpc2">USDA</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia residents have experienced much lower food insecurity over the course of the pandemic because of increased SNAP benefits, according to Eddie Oliver, the executive director of the Federation of Virginia Food Banks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Federation of Virginia Food Banks is a nonprofit state association that works with the seven regional food banks in Virginia to improve nutrition security, according to Oliver.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We know the second they end and they go back to their previous levels, then we know we’re going to see that in our pantry lines that we’re going to be affected for sure,” Oliver said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oliver said that while food insecurity is not a new problem, the pandemic has put the issue in the spotlight. The “stronger safety net” for food insecurity present during the pandemic worked well, according to Oliver.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We know the expiration of emergency allotments will create a hunger cliff in Virginia for our 900,000 neighbors who rely on SNAP to keep food on the table,” Oliver stated in an email.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia’s seven regional food banks are preparing for a “surge in demand” for food assistance, according to Oliver.</p>
<p dir="ltr">John Jones, food insecurity researcher and assistant professor in Virginia Commonwealth University’s Center for Environmental Studies, advocated for expanded SNAP benefits in Virginia. Increased benefits are a “powerful” way to mitigate the worst effects of poverty, Jones said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When you’re expanding the amount of money that people are receiving or expanding the number of people that can receive this, that’s going to positively impact food security and negatively impact food insecurity,” Jones said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. <span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span> A proposal to outlaw the <span class="il">declawing</span> of cats, a procedure that animal rights advocates call cruel and unnecessary, failed to advance from a House subcommittee last month.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1382" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231%2Bsum%2BHB1382&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675736567611000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0EGaPFmnMZmijQYOazMDrh">House Bill 1382</a> would have made cat <span class="il">declawing</span> a $500 civil penalty for the first violation, $1,000 for the second violation and $2,500 for the third or any subsequent violation. The bill was tabled by a 6-4 vote in a House Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources subcommittee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill is important because cats’ claws are natural and used for stretching, marking territory, balance and more, according to Molly Armus, Virginia state director of the Humane Society of the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="il">Declawing</span> cats is actually an “incredibly painful procedure,” according to Armus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think it’s up to us, as people who are taking these cats into our homes, to learn more humane and less invasive ways to manage scratching,” Armus said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An onychectomy, or <span class="il">declawing</span>, is a surgery that includes 10 separate amputations, according to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or <a href="https://www.peta.org/issues/animal-companion-issues/cruel-practices/declawing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.peta.org/issues/animal-companion-issues/cruel-practices/declawing/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675736567611000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3bQh_MD-XNF3gzxJIrV0hs">PETA</a>. PETA is the largest animal rights organization in the world, according to its <a href="https://www.peta.org/about-peta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.peta.org/about-peta/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675736567611000&amp;usg=AOvVaw16X1B-E_Ygw8Au1aIc4IJW">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span class="il">Declawing</span> is typically performed for convenience, according to the Animal League Defense Fund. Many people <span class="il">declaw</span> their cats to prevent scratching, its <a href="https://aldf.org/issue/declawing-cats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aldf.org/issue/declawing-cats/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675736567611000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3GeOkrzByOkzC9ugnktSsU">website</a> states.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Localities around the nation, a couple of states, including our neighbor Maryland, have passed a <span class="il">declawing</span> ban,” said bill sponsor Del. Gwendolyn Gooditis, D-Clarke, in the committee meeting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">New York and Maryland are the only U.S. states that have outlawed <span class="il">declawing</span>. Multiple U.S. cities have passed <span class="il">declawing</span> laws, with the most located in California, according to <a href="https://www.peta.org/blog/where-declawing-is-illegal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.peta.org/blog/where-declawing-is-illegal/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675736567611000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2SlAjF4A2hwpnGf78VtdqF">PETA</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“<span class="il">Declawing</span> cats means, look at your hands, it would be the equivalent of your fingers and your toes being chopped off at the first knuckle,” Gooditis said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The procedure can cause impaired balance, as much as a person would after losing his or her toes, according to PETA. Declawed cats may have to relearn how to walk.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s a removal of that last bone,” Gooditis said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Susan Seward, a lobbyist for the Virginia Veterinary Medical Association, or VVMA, testified against the bill in the committee meeting. The VVMA strongly opposed the bill, Seward said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think one of the unintended consequences would be setting up a really unpleasant and adversarial relationship between animal control and veterinarians, and that is certainly not a relationship we want to diminish,” Seward said to the committee panel.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alice Burton, program director for nonprofit animal welfare organization Alley Cat Allies, said the organization was disappointed the bill failed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alley Cat Allies mission is to protect and improve the lives of cats. according to its <a href="https://www.alleycat.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.alleycat.org/about/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675736567611000&amp;usg=AOvVaw23mXPWZv9X8zD_MGlJ6k1j">website</a>. The organization operates a trap-neuter-return program to help stabilize the cat population. A cat is transported to a veterinarian, spayed and returned to its original location.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s an act of cruelty to <span class="il">declaw</span> cats, according to Burton, who was an animal control officer for 15 years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They no longer have their nails as a defense, so their first instinct is to bite,” Burton said. “So all of a sudden they’ve got these bites on their record, which obviously does not bode well for them.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Declawed cats also struggle to use the litter box because the litter hurts their paws, she said. Many cats who have been declawed will stop using the litter box and soil where they aren’t supposed to, Burton said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I would say most of the time these negative effects lead to these cats being surrendered to the shelters or rescue groups,” Burton said. “They would, in most cases, be deemed unadoptable and they would be euthanized.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are many other humane options out there, according to Burton.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Humane alternatives to <span class="il">declawing</span> include trimming a cat&#8217;s claws regularly, using deterrents such as double-sided tape on furniture, rubber caps for the nails and providing a variety of scratching options, according to<a href="https://www.alleycat.org/community-cat-care/cat-behavior-scratching/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.alleycat.org/community-cat-care/cat-behavior-scratching/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1675736567611000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3xupirYf9jFuyrufNR0tmp"> Alley Cat Allies.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re not giving up,” Burton said. “We’re going to come back and keep fighting.”</p>

Election results will be certified on Dec. 5. The two districts that received the most congressional write-in votes were the 11th and 7th districts, with 852 and 647 write-in votes, respectively.

<p dir="ltr">“It’s a bit of a protest vote,” said Amanda Wintersieck about why people chose not to vote for candidates officially on the ballot. Wintersieck is an associate professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University whose research focuses on political behavior and communication.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In most election years, the top two individuals who get write-in votes are Mickey Mouse and Santa Claus,” she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Minnie and Mickey Mouse were both nominated this year. However, write-in contenders skewed more to the dark side this election, including Darth Vader, Hellraiser and Cobra Commander — G.I. Joe’s nemesis. Some Madison County voters threw their support to deceased presidential assassins John Wilkes Booth, who killed Abraham Lincoln, and Lee Harvey Oswald, who killed John F. Kennedy. Former presidents George Washington and John Adams were also voter selections.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Most voters do not write in candidates to be strategic, Wintersieck said, but rather as a way of noting: “I don’t want either of these candidates.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other people who write in names genuinely believe their selected candidate should win, she said. Some states have the option to select “none of these candidates” to stop people from putting in fictional characters and people not running for office, Wintersieck said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former 7th District challenger and current state Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, was endorsed in Spotsylvania and Culpeper counties. Eric Cantor, who formerly served seven terms in the 7th District, and Dave Brat, who bested Cantor in a primary and served for one term, each received at least one vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some voters wrote in the names of candidates who represented the locality before redistricting. U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, received write-in votes from counties he used to represent before the 1st District was redrawn. This could be due to voter confusion, “brand familiarity” from having the same representative for years, or voters trying to make a statement against redistricting and the new candidates, Wintersieck said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Write-in votes did not impact any congressional races. Write-in candidates won local elections where there were not enough candidates to fill seats. <a href="https://greenejournal.com/kelley-wins-fourth-seat-on-stanardsville-town-council-p4184-198.htm#:~:text=Kevin%20Kelley%2C%2064%2C%20won%20the,GreeneJournal%20courtesy%20photo." target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://greenejournal.com/kelley-wins-fourth-seat-on-stanardsville-town-council-p4184-198.htm%23:~:text%3DKevin%2520Kelley%252C%252064%252C%2520won%2520the,GreeneJournal%2520courtesy%2520photo.&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1670088915191000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0qcNduc5DL7nTKiVuDqrPh">Kevin Kelley</a>, a write-in candidate, won a seat on the Stanardsville Town Council, according to Jennifer Lewis-Fowler, director of elections for Greene County. This was the only race that required write-in votes to be tabulated in Greene County.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Isaac Kelley, age 19, became the youngest candidate to win in the town of Timberville, in Rockingham County. He won an uncontested seat on the Town Council after deciding at noon on Election Day to launch his campaign, according to the <a href="https://www.dnronline.com/news/rockingham_county/last-minute-write-in-candidate-kelley-19-wins-in-timberville/article_b9eaf318-a6a1-5f50-b30f-e1e68c8fcfb1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dnronline.com/news/rockingham_county/last-minute-write-in-candidate-kelley-19-wins-in-timberville/article_b9eaf318-a6a1-5f50-b30f-e1e68c8fcfb1.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1670088915191000&amp;usg=AOvVaw29kr3EfZd6q02jH_OvBeBT">Daily News-Record</a>. He used a whiteboard to promote his name as a candidate and won by an 18-vote margin, according to DNR.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The U.S. is governed by what Wintersieck said is a gerontocracy — a political <span class="il">system</span> operated by older people.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s really encouraging to see young people running and it’s really encouraging to see young people winning,” Wintersieck said. She encouraged candidates to mentor and train younger people to serve.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Perhaps some voters took “Rock the Vote” too literally. Rockers Bob Dylan, Trent Reznor, Keith Richards and Frank Zappa were all write-in options for the 7th District.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some voters merely identified what they wanted in a candidate and suggested a representative “that supports Black people” and “with better ideas.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other voters put their faith in the power of Batman, Samuel L. Jackson, Nicholas Cage and Hulk Hogan to clean up Congress.</p>

<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. – Sea level rise will continue to impact the Hampton Roads area, scientists warn, but climate change was not necessarily an issue that pulled 2nd District voters to the polls — and it was not a part of the candidates’ platforms either.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The tight race ended with a defeat for Democrat and two-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria. Republican challenger and former state Sen. Jen Kiggans won with just over 10,000 more votes and was the only Virginia congressional candidate to beat an incumbent in the midterm elections.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Beach voters reported their overall top issues were economic security, abortion and threats to democracy, according to a Wason Center poll of 2nd District voters <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2022-10-21.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2022-10-21.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668808917303000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3Ca0mY0TMoXf1lF3LeNSxa">released</a> in mid-October. However, the priority of each issue was different between Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democrat and Independent voters surveyed throughout Virginia, not just the 2nd District, did rank climate change as very important, according to a Wason Center <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2022-10-12.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2022-10-12.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668808917303000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3nN5sAFAqdnWib40JNaQ7o">poll</a> also published in October. Voters could rank the importance of multiple issues. It appears when voters don’t have to prioritize climate change against other issues, such as the economy and abortion, they say it is important.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maria Reynoso is the founder and executive director for We Vote Virginia, a nonpartisan digital media resource to help voters become more informed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Although climate change has been on the minds of voters, it does seem like more national issues moved them,” Reynoso stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Beach voters represent almost 60% of the 2nd District, according to the <a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/us-representative-2/district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/offices/us-representative-2/district/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668808917303000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2AZb-IIQOze0XbiK-MtwdH">Virginia Public Access Project</a>. This coastal region is experiencing the highest rate of sea level rise on the East Coast, according to the<a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/5bde0a2b4cec4bf7966d0fc5d564d9d9?item=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://storymaps.arcgis.com/collections/5bde0a2b4cec4bf7966d0fc5d564d9d9?item%3D1&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668808917303000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2TrDXdhI0J8V2h22MWX3QI"> City of Virginia Beach Department of Public Works</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jatia Wrighten holds a doctorate in political science and is an assistant political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The reason that climate change in the environment doesn&#8217;t matter to people is because it&#8217;s not immediate,” Wrighten said. “In terms of policy, people want to see results. They want to feel that their vote mattered right now.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">For Republican voters, climate change does come across as a concern, “a couple of decades down the road,” said Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, speaking from the Kiggans’ victory party on election night.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When you’re wondering how you’re going to pay your gas bill and your electric bill, and how you’re going to fill your gas tank up — that kind of takes precedence as far as a sense of urgency,” Miyares said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Environmental groups such as the <a href="https://www.cbf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cbf.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668808917303000&amp;usg=AOvVaw26X5sJqaCIa7eLFoUumpIL">Chesapeake Bay Foundation</a> see climate change as a serious issue in the 2nd District right now.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hampton Roads has the second largest population in the U.S. after New Orleans at risk for sea level rise, according to Christy Everett, the Hampton Roads Chesapeake Bay Foundation director.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The area has already been impacted by flooding and “will see it increasingly become more problematic and challenging,” according to Everett.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More than 10 inches of relative sea level change has increased in Norfolk between 1960 to 2017, Everett said. Relative sea level change is indicated by “how the height of the ocean rises or falls relative to the land at a particular location,” according to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-level" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-sea-level&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668808917303000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ZJu8cS_06IZb9QN9q5vEj">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. The mean sea level in Norfolk is projected to rise by over 1 foot by 2050, according to a Virginia Institute for Marine Science <a href="https://www.naturalresources.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-natural-resources/images/1c.-Sea-level-rise-projections-for-Virginia-planning-purposes-(2)-FINAL-10_31.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.naturalresources.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-natural-resources/images/1c.-Sea-level-rise-projections-for-Virginia-planning-purposes-(2)-FINAL-10_31.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668808917303000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0yPUfxoL-B2BJx7voSxko0">report</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Norfolk is home to the largest naval base in the world. Some entrance gates onto Naval Station Norfolk are “consistently” blocked by intense flooding, and this can pose a problem for the military, Everett said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Kiggans addressed the issue during a first <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?523485-1/virginia-2nd-congressional-district-debate" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.c-span.org/video/?523485-1/virginia-2nd-congressional-district-debate&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668808917303000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3rp454WoapgLs6JEpDV2-d">debate</a> with Luria. She mentioned how flooding affects the military specifically and said she wants to restore strength through infrastructure while avoiding government mandates. Luria responded by briefly mentioning the $350 million in federal funding that will go toward a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/05/norfolk-seawall-flood-army-corps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/10/05/norfolk-seawall-flood-army-corps/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668808917303000&amp;usg=AOvVaw19AtdvvO2fb_STgyWnvXBE">sea wall project</a> in Norfolk. She went on to accuse her opponent of not liking government mandates, yet wanting to restrain abortion access.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some of the flooding is caused by<a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/04/24/political-will-funding-needed-combat-increased-flooding-issues-experts-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbc12.com/2022/04/24/political-will-funding-needed-combat-increased-flooding-issues-experts-say/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668808917303000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1BTMYeP4sGZgAVoe4cbkHz"> increased precipitation due to climate change</a>, but there are infrastructure solutions that Hampton Roads could implement, according to Everett. For example, increasing tree canopies and green infrastructure could help capture and divert quick accumulations of water.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There’s a lot that we can do,” Everett said. “We can do it smartly, but we really just have to be innovative and approach it the right way.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Miyares said technology like Dominion Energy’s <a href="https://coastalvawind.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://coastalvawind.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1668808917303000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YzvTbnGM0tOpEZ8zIRL6v">Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project</a> is a solution to “naturally” help combat climate change and to be innovative.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The commercial project will be the largest offshore wind farm in the U.S. The utility company currently has two wind turbines in place 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach and plans to build over 170 more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re the most innovative people on the planet,” Miyares said. “That’s who Americans are, we innovate.”</p>

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>By Meghan McIntyre / Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">RICHMOND, Va. — The Food and Drug Administration added Adderall to its drug shortage <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-announces-shortage-adderall" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-announces-shortage-adderall&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1667508806899000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0IyYlRo8N2BG_B6_I4BAxJ" target="_blank">website</a> last month, and doctors say Virginia patients being treated for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder are feeling the impact.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The leading reasons for the shortage, which primarily affects immediate-release Adderall and similar generic versions, are manufacturing delays and insufficient supplies to meet market demands, according to the FDA.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia patients with ADHD have “absolutely” been impacted by the shortage, said Dr. Dorothy O’Keefe, outpatient clinic director for the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in the Virginia Treatment Center for Children.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Kara Beatty, an adult psychiatrist with her own private practice and the president of the Psychiatric Society of Virginia, said her office is “getting phone calls left and right” from patients who say their Adderall prescriptions can’t be filled.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stimulants such as Adderall are the most commonly used medications to treat ADHD in children and adults, according to prescription price comparison service <a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/adhd/ten-things-adults-should-know-about-their-adhd-medications" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/adhd/ten-things-adults-should-know-about-their-adhd-medications&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1667508806899000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jIvHfu_O5dlLAEQCDqLhs" target="_blank">GoodRx</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stimulant prescriptions dispensed in Virginia rose 11% from the start of 2021 to June 30 of this year – the largest increase of all controlled substances overseen by the state’s Prescription Monitoring Program, according to its most recent <a href="https://www.dhp.virginia.gov/media/dhpweb/docs/pmp/reports/quarterly_2022Q2.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dhp.virginia.gov/media/dhpweb/docs/pmp/reports/quarterly_2022Q2.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1667508806899000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2WeU7GvsNgMp45j155z7ls" target="_blank">report</a>. The active ingredients in Adderall are some of the stimulants monitored in the program, O’Keefe said. Child psychiatrists or pediatricians are unlikely to use stimulants for any other indication than ADHD, she said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Data is not recorded in a way to determine the exact percentage of each type of stimulant monitored by the program, stated Diane Powers, director of communications for the Virginia Department of Health Professions, in an email.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Patients treated for ADHD in Beatty’s practice typically start off with prescriptions for Adderall or Ritalin, another stimulant monitored in the program, Beatty said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, Adderall prescriptions for patients ages 22 to 44 jumped 15% from 2020 to 2021, according to <a href="https://www.trillianthealth.com/insights/the-compass/sharp-uptick-in-adderall-prescribing-for-adults-ages-22-44-amid-covid-19-pandemic" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.trillianthealth.com/insights/the-compass/sharp-uptick-in-adderall-prescribing-for-adults-ages-22-44-amid-covid-19-pandemic&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1667508806899000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2J7nH-utunDLfVjaMH4xOd" target="_blank">Trilliant Health</a>, a firm that provides market analytics to the health care industry. Other age groups remained relatively stable.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors can prescribe some controlled substances such as Adderall through online telehealth services since the federal government declared a public health emergency in spring 2020, according to the <a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/coronavirus.html#TELE" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/coronavirus.html%23TELE&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1667508806899000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3_UyaI-XWRSZSqcLZra93n" target="_blank">U.S. Drug Enforcement A</a><a href="https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/coronavirus.html#TELE" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/coronavirus.html%23TELE&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1667508806900000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2cEcYAvtNiBd2yeNFfGnJz" target="_blank">gency</a>. The health emergency has been renewed several times since the pandemic began, most recently last <a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PHE/Pages/covid19-13Oct2022.aspx" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PHE/Pages/covid19-13Oct2022.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1667508806900000&amp;usg=AOvVaw18qnYvak17FXSPdPyh6TdP" target="_blank">month</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, there was an uptick in online mental health care startups that began prescribing Adderall, Beatty said. Mental health startup Cerebral is currently being investigated by the federal government for potential violations of the Controlled Substances Act, according to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ceo-of-mental-health-startup-cerebral-confident-in-companys-practices-despite-doj-investigation/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ceo-of-mental-health-startup-cerebral-confident-in-companys-practices-despite-doj-investigation/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1667508806900000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Ec_To0acuC7yZE0ggJDk5" target="_blank">CBS</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Board of Pharmacy “would like to caution consumers to the risk of purchasing drugs online or through social media from rogue outlets preying on increased demand during drug shortages,” Powers stated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Meaghan, 43, works in insurance and was diagnosed with ADHD three years ago. She requested to have her last name withheld because she said there is a stigma around ADHD and its treatment. She knows firsthand what it’s like to not be able to access her prescribed Adderall for days due to shortages.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not going to accomplish what I could have the days that I did have my medication,” Meaghan said. “It’s life changing for a lot of people.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Children without access to their prescribed Adderall can struggle in school and social relationships, O’Keefe said. Their behavior might become problematic as a result.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest thing I would say for people with ADHD, besides being impulsive and wanting to do things instantly, is to be able to do the time management,” Meaghan said. “That’s a coping mechanism a lot of people have to develop.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Going without medication can be “like an inability to function,” Beatty said. There are other types of treatments for people with ADHD, she said, but transitioning from one to another can be frustrating.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some patients have made the switch to Ritalin or nonstimulant medications due to the shortage, but O’Keefe said it can be a gamble whether the new medicine will be as effective.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“If we are forced to make the change because they can’t get the product that they’re used to, it may turn out just fine,” O’Keefe said. “But it may turn out that they end up with a medicine that doesn’t work as well or causes more side effects.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Patients by law can only get a 30-day supply of Adderall. They can have a difficult time managing insurance policies and trying to figure out which pharmacy has the drug in stock each month, O’Keefe said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Meaghan’s pharmacy has run out of stock of her prescription several times, she said, and as a result has gone days without it. Some people notice when she hasn’t taken her medication, she said.</p>

(Megan Lee / VCU CNS)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Cassandra Loper / Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">RICHMOND, Va. — Roughly three years ago, Maria Reynoso determined local policy issues and election information were not readily available or easily digestible to the average voter, and especially younger voters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reynoso now runs We Vote Virginia, a nonpartisan digital media resource to help voters become more informed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“What my focus when creating the organization, and I guess my mission, was really to make it incredibly accessible and fun and engaging to learn about local politics,” Reynoso said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most critical change happens in local and state politics, according to Reynoso. Virginia voter turnout traditionally drops off between presidential elections. Candidates are vying for U.S. House of Representatives seats in Congress this year, with other local races and initiatives on the ballot throughout the state’s districts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Political organizers and candidates are watching to see if they pull younger voters to the polls in an election that could change the balance of power in Congress. They hope that more education on the importance of voting, and how to vote, can develop a consistent habit among young voters whose participation can be a wildcard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Commonwealth University’s VCU Votes Student Coalition is a network of the university’s students, faculty and staff that promotes voter engagement on campus, according to the VCU Votes <a href="https://vcu.campusgroups.com/vcuvotes/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vcu.campusgroups.com/vcuvotes/home/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mOWlG7KUInNU9tXJFOgWi">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Younger voters are considered a wildcard because they&#8217;re still very new to voting, and I think also, they&#8217;re still new to the democratic process as a whole,” said Cameron Hart, director of partnerships for VCU Votes Student Coalition.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Young voters understand the urgency of issues, such as climate change, according to Hart, and it can motivate them to the polls.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both the Democratic and Republican parties of Virginia could do more in terms of encouraging young people to vote by making appearances on college campuses, Hart said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Generation X, millennials and Generation Z make up over 46% of the Virginia population, according to American Community Survey data by the <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=Virginia%20population&amp;g=0100000US&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2021.S0101" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q%3DVirginia%2520population%26g%3D0100000US%26tid%3DACSST1Y2021.S0101&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw102jDW-vzxp4ftUvv9z7lZ">U.S. Census Bureau</a>. That percentage is totaled from the categories of ages 20-54, although the generations are ages 10-57. Eligible Gen Z and millennial voters ages 20-44 account for over a third of the population, based on the census data.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia young voter turnout ages 18-29 has been a mixed bag in the past few elections, according to the <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/update-youth-voter-turnout-2021-new-jersey-and-virginia-elections" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/update-youth-voter-turnout-2021-new-jersey-and-virginia-elections&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Sm2odXp3E1qbxsVQbeP1y">Tufts Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement</a>, or CIRCLE. That age group is most commonly used by researchers, versus a precise snapshot of voter participation by generation.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The 18-29 voter turnout more than doubled in the 2018 midterm election, according to CIRCLE (13% to 33%). Virginia voters are inconsistent when it comes to midterm elections in general. Since 2000, anywhere from almost 32% to almost 60% of voters participated, according to the Virginia Department of Elections <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registrationturnout-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registrationturnout-statistics/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0aei_v0hrExy79VOpmJ9lN">website</a>.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The 18-29 voter turnout was 56% in Virginia in 2020, according to <a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw06snpqq0xhlV93QCKUwCSj">CIRCLE</a>, up from 48% in 2016. Voter turnout for the 2020 presidential election was the highest turnout of the 21st century overall.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"> The 18-29 voter turnout decreased in the 2021 gubernatorial election, according to CIRCLE, from 34% in 2017 to 27%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Social media is a great way to engage young voters, according to Reynoso. The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/we_vote_va/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.instagram.com/we_vote_va/?hl%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0v-dh747lkYJxfPeIFFzZO">We Vote VA</a> Instagram account launched in late 2019. The account now has nearly 16,000 followers and is one of the organization&#8217;s primary methods of reaching voters. It features easy to read and visually appealing posts containing information about polling locations, important dates, redistricting background and more. The concept is to inform and help create a habit of voting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is so important that young voters know their facts,” Ellie Sorensen, press secretary for the Republican Party of Virginia, stated in an email.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Young voters may think their vote doesn’t matter because some policy issues might not directly impact them, according to Sorensen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Sometimes, voters just vote based on what other people around them vote, but if they are taught the importance of voting and the facts about what they are actually voting for, it will encourage younger people to vote,” Sorensen stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voting can become a habit, especially when voters can see the “good it can do,” according to Gianni Snidle, press secretary for the Democratic Party of Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If we’re not actively participating in our democracy, then we’re failing,” Snidle said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nonprofit organization Rock the Vote has worked to make voting a habit among young voters since 1990. It launched with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxLHkGfNgxM" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DjxLHkGfNgxM&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3VN9UxxGeI8zfhPe6jscZq">public service announcement</a> featuring singer, songwriter and actress Madonna.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rock the Vote serves as a one-stop shop for all things voting, Carolyn DeWitt, president and executive director, stated in an email. Voters can check registration status, request an absentee ballot, get election reminders and view election deadlines through the <a href="https://www.rockthevote.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.rockthevote.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3S5nY_-6iV3n6wFrqNSyWX">website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The organization had direct channels to young voters through its partnership with MTV, and through concert venues where it would register people to vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rock the Vote has adapted through the decades and was the first to launch an online voter registration platform in the late 1990s, according to an<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-10-28/rock-the-vote-madonna-youth-election-turnout-30" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-10-28/rock-the-vote-madonna-youth-election-turnout-30&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0m9ouBpii4ZD3GzFwrnOnk"> L.A. Times</a> report. The organization reports that it has helped register <a href="https://www.rockthevote.org/about-rock-the-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.rockthevote.org/about-rock-the-vote/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3f5Pdru0_LApr1xEfcE0RO">14 million</a> people to vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new generation of voters are extraordinarily in touch with their values, according to DeWitt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But over the past few years, they’ve witnessed our political culture become increasingly volatile and our democracy threatened on multiple counts,” DeWitt stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Young people know their value and they keep showing up despite the obstacles put before them, according to DeWitt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">State lawmakers have made voting more accessible in recent years. Virginia voters are no longer required to show photo identification at the polls. Voters<a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/voter-id/outreach-materials/documents/Voter-Identification-Chart---Revised-10.2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/voter-id/outreach-materials/documents/Voter-Identification-Chart---Revised-10.2022.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw12BWEHSYcow9U95MClEf3J"> can prove their identity</a> with things such as a driver’s license, passport, college student ID and even a current bank statement or utility bill that contains the voter&#8217;s name and address. Same-day voter registration can be done up to and on Election Day, although voters receive a provisional ballot.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Voters can find local polling places and request an absentee ballot on the <a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/Lookup/polling" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/Lookup/polling&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1666728239839000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3M8MgpsEjHqfQL3d_msuxR">Virginia Department of Elections website</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Early voting started Sept. 23 and will end on Nov. 5. Absentee ballots must be requested by Oct. 28 and postmarked by Election Day on Nov. 8.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>By Faith Redd</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia legislators tabled a bill during the regular General Assembly session that pledged to end roadway fatalities. The move disappointed road safety advocates, but supporters say they’re still committed to advancing policies to protect pedestrians and drivers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hj100" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D221%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhj100&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649422932213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ekZbQe037qQ5udxibZEfJ">House Joint Resolution 100</a> was a commitment to the Vision Zero initiative, which seeks to end roadway fatalities by 2050 and cut them in half by 2030. The legislation received no support in a House subcommittee and died in the transportation committee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On average two people died and at least 18 people were injured daily in Virginia traffic crashes in 2020, according to the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+HJ100+pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221%2Bful%2BHJ100%2Bpdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649422932213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2cGUY90Wg_s0xjGKZP8-W5">bill resolution statement</a>. Almost 850 people were killed in Virginia that year and over 110 were pedestrians. Nearly 7,000 people were seriously injured that same year due to traffic crashes and over 370 were pedestrians.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Kaye Kory, D-Fairfax and Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, patroned the resolution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vision Zero originated in Sweden in 1997. The program is a strategy to achieve a transportation system with no deaths or serious injuries, through policy, equity and improved traffic death reporting data, according to the initiative&#8217;s <a href="https://visionzeronetwork.org/about/what-is-vision-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://visionzeronetwork.org/about/what-is-vision-zero/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649422932213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2uU_r1wAN47ZlNTlIz51s5">website</a>.

The proposed resolution would have adopted the safety initiative for the entire state.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Traffic deaths and serious injuries can be eliminated by taking proactive and preventative measures such as proper engineering, enforcement, evaluation and education, the strategy states.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Richmond and Alexandria cities were early adopters of the Vision Zero plan in Virginia. Alexandria adopted its Vision Zero plan in late 2017. At least 1,000 residents, visitors, employees and business owners were active in the Vision Zero action plan process, according to the City of Alexandria website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alex Carroll manages street infrastructure and safety initiatives in Alexandria while working on Vision Zero with other partners such as the Alexandria Police Department. Alexandria’s team has completed education campaigns to inform people of their rights and responsibilities when using roads. They also provide monthly classes that incorporate Vision Zero training to city employees who drive city vehicles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vision Zero’s goal to end traffic deaths and injuries is ambitious, but the city is dedicated to the initiative, Carroll said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We&#8217;re committed to getting as close to that as we can,” Carroll said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Localities committed to the Vision Zero initiative help highlight the initiative, Carroll said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Virginia is starting to pay more attention to Vision Zero and traffic safety,” Carroll said. “They&#8217;re all taking the lead from localities like Alexandria and Arlington and others as well as the federal government to integrate safety more into what they do.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over 30 high-visibility crosswalks have been installed in Alexandria, along with permanent crossing improvements and new signals at high pedestrian crash locations, according to a third year <a href="https://media.alexandriava.gov/docs-archives/tes/info/vz=annualprogressreport=yr3cy2020-combined.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://media.alexandriava.gov/docs-archives/tes/info/vz%3Dannualprogressreport%3Dyr3cy2020-combined.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649422932213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw38KqVWt2qT0-L8HJYc5wOT">progress report</a> by the Alexandria Families For Safe Streets group.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bike Walk RVA, an initiative of the active lifestyle organization Sports Backers, is one of the organizations involved with Vision Zero in Richmond. Bike Walk RVA supports pedestrian and bicycling-friendly infrastructure through citywide projects, according to the program&#8217;s website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brantley Tyndall, director of outreach at Bike Walk RVA, said the resolution’s failure was disappointing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It will be a setback to life-saving measures,” Tyndall said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sarah G. Taylor, the assistant city manager and legislative director of Alexandria, said she is disappointed that the bill died in committee, but thinks groups will continue to make progress.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers passed other transportation safety legislation like <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB247" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221%2Bsum%2BSB247&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649422932213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1hc2MaaasJZuOBRAkx2YYs">Senate Bill 247</a> and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb920" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D221%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb920&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1649422932213000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1YwbSyt0xv8iofvCaZqTJZ">House Bill 920</a>, which advocates said are positive steps forward. A driver can face misdemeanor charges and have their license suspended if found guilty of careless driving that kills or seriously injures a vulnerable road user, such as a pedestrian or bicyclist.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There&#8217;s not one bill. There&#8217;s not one law. There&#8217;s not one study. There&#8217;s not one thing,” Taylor said. “It&#8217;s what are all the things that we can put together that in combination make our roads safer for cyclists, pedestrians and vulnerable road users.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">From hand sanitizer and vaccines to groceries and toilet paper, truck drivers are trucking through the COVID-19 pandemic despite a historic labor shortage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many industries moved workers home during the start of the pandemic, but truckers worked “to meet the needs of this country.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The trucking industry has stepped up and delivered through this whole pandemic,” said Dale Bennett, who has served as president of the Virginia Trucking Association since 1989.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The VTA is a dues-paying membership organization that supports members and lobbies the General Assembly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bennett said the trucking industry is experiencing the worst labor shortage that he has ever seen. The American Trucking Association <a href="https://www.trucking.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/Spear%20Written%20Statement%20T%20and%20I%20Supply%20Chain%20hearing.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.trucking.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/Spear%2520Written%2520Statement%2520T%2520and%2520I%2520Supply%2520Chain%2520hearing.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640731184149000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Jjpwt2KuneIUoxBAmLeSg">estimated</a> that by the end of 2021 there will be a shortage of over 80,000 workers, and it will double by 2030. The exact shortage in Virginia is unclear, according to Bennett.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“That is the highest that it&#8217;s ever been,” Bennett said. “The driver shortage may be as bad as I have seen it in my time here.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In an October report to Congress, the American Trucking Association, or ATA, laid out eight primary reasons for the industry shortage:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">High retirement numbers due to an aging workforce.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Women account for just over 6% of the workforce.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Failed drug tests.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Federally mandated minimum age of 21 to drive commercially across state lines.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Lifestyle issues, such as long hours away from home.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Barriers such as potential candidates inability to meet hiring standards for driving record or criminal histories.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Truck driver training schools trained far fewer drivers than normal in 2020.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Infrastructure and other issues, like a lack of truck parking spots causing drivers to stop earlier to rest for the night. Congestion also limits drivers’ ability to safely and efficiently make deliveries.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Refueling the pipeline of workers</h4>

	
<p dir="ltr">The industry will have to recruit <a href="https://www.trucking.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/ATA%20Driver%20Shortage%20Report%202021%20Executive%20Summary.FINAL_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.trucking.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/ATA%2520Driver%2520Shortage%2520Report%25202021%2520Executive%2520Summary.FINAL_.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640731184149000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0WRDn9eRRDXUUCg9M85WWK">nearly 1 million</a> new drivers over the next decade to replace drivers and hire needed ones due to industry growth, the ATA forecast.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The trucking industry hauls over 70% of U.S. freight, according to the ATA. Consumer demand is high and 42% of Americans say they plan to spend $500 more this holiday season than last, according to the quarterly <a href="https://www.massmutual.com/static/path/media/files/2021massmutualholidayfinances.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.massmutual.com/static/path/media/files/2021massmutualholidayfinances.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640731184149000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1XItubO9mrUZfArIH5GFbI">MassMutual </a>Holiday Finances Consumer Spending and Saving Quarterly Index.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of heavy, or CDL-licensed, tractor-trailer drivers decreased from 43,620 in May 2019 to 42,120 in May 2020 (down 3.4%) while the number of light truck drivers increased from 20,970 to 21,850 during that same time period (up 4.2%), according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_va.htm#53-0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_va.htm%2353-0000&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640731184150000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Kqm0wYFHeoegKzyaEtQCL">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Pickup and delivery drivers fall into the light truck driver category.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bennett warned that Virginia is short of the amount of heavy truck drivers needed to meet demand from consumers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve got a demographic problem in the industry,” Bennett said. “The average age is older than the general workforce and a lot of those folks are retiring.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Under federal law, a driver has to be at least 21 to drive outside of the state where they hold a commercial driver&#8217;s license. Large trucking companies in Virginia like Old Dominion Freight Line have routes reaching from Anchorage, Alaska to Miami. The inability to travel over state lines makes drivers under 21 less valuable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“A 19 year old can drive a tractor trailer from Norfolk, Virginia all the way to Bristol, Virginia,” Bennett said. “But once he gets to Bristol he cannot drive that tractor trailer over state lines into Bristol, Tennessee.” Congress passed the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640731184150000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2v6KzJpC1d_UjyF-2Wm8gP">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> on Nov. 5, which includes provisions for an apprenticeship pilot program that would enable drivers under 21 to drive interstate after passing the program.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Oregon, will invest $110 billion into roads, bridges and projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/51750600775_ac227457e0_h.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-29950" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/51750600775_ac227457e0_h-243x300.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/51750600775_ac227457e0_h-243x300.jpg 243w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/51750600775_ac227457e0_h-829x1024.jpg 829w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/51750600775_ac227457e0_h-768x949.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/51750600775_ac227457e0_h.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other issues driving the labor shortage</h4>

	
<p dir="ltr">COVID-19 vaccine requirements could affect the labor force also. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration <a href="https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/11042021" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/national/11042021&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640731184150000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2_6RFCjTkWcd_73kz7QbFd">issued</a> an emergency temporary standard on Nov. 4 which requires covered employers with more than 100 workers to mandate the COVID-19 vaccine or require regular testing. ATA CEO and president Chris Spears predicted in a <a href="https://www.trucking.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/OSHA%20Comments%2010%2021%2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.trucking.org/sites/default/files/2021-10/OSHA%2520Comments%252010%252021%252021.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640731184150000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1yIB1idxQHe5giIKRiT3ea">letter</a> released on Oct. 21 that the policy could lead to companies losing up to 37% of their drivers to retirements, attrition to smaller carriers or conversion to independent contractor owner-operators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Age is not the only demographic where the trucking industry is an outlier. Women account for over 6% of truck drivers compared to over 47% of the general workforce, according to a 2017<a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/industry-occupation/truckers-acs17.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/industry-occupation/truckers-acs17.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640731184150000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3D281LMyukFk6FvtLZuVEg"> survey</a> conducted by the Census Bureau.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pandemic also caused temporary shutdowns of driver training schools and the Department of Motor Vehicles, which made addressing the urgent labor shortage difficult.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Duncan Quicke, coordinator of the truck driving training school at Southside Virginia Community College in Brunswick County, said the school closed for three months at the start of the pandemic. Demand for CDL classes is now at an all time high, but it’s more difficult to schedule appointments at DMV, Quicke said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our classes prior to COVID were probably averaging seven to eight individuals per six-week period,” Quicke said. “Our class size today is probably averaging 10 to 11.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Weak links in the supply chain</h4>

	
<p dir="ltr">Truck companies are also feeling the impact of the supply chain issue. Companies have trouble ordering new trucks or parts to fix their fleets, Bennett said. A global microchip shortage has driven up the value of new and used cars. People are buying auto parts to keep their old vehicles running, which creates an extreme demand for parts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They are cannibalizing parts off of older vehicles just to keep them running and moving freight,” Bennett said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act includes a 38% increase in funding for bridges and roads. The Virginia Department of Transportation will manage the funds but a portion of funding is expected to be allocated to growing the Norfolk Harbor, according to a <a href="https://spanberger.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=4200" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://spanberger.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID%3D4200&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640731184150000&amp;usg=AOvVaw37e3V1ZX-dOQbTsjGLX7C5">press release</a> from Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-7th.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Long delays at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/business/supply-chain-crisis-savannah-port.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/business/supply-chain-crisis-savannah-port.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640731184150000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1g0HJR7N6gdbtpJRs4w4t5">ports</a> have made getting freight delivered on time a challenge for carriers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s called a chain for a lot of reasons, because it’s got a lot of links in it,” Bennett said. “Not all of those links are operating as efficiently as they need to be.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cameron Jones/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia voters in a recent poll ranked themselves as moderate, with a slightly conservative lean, but indicated support of more progressive legislation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2021-05-05.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2021-05-05.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620835093662000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtDQpp_mFq1fdjkN7Vg3XgK5UMwg">poll</a>, released last week by Christopher Newport’s Wason Center for Civic Leadership, could be a thermometer for the upcoming November election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia voters ranked themselves an average of 5.83 on a zero to 10 scale (liberal to conservative). Republicans ranked themselves 8.11 on average, while Democrats rated themselves 3.57 on average. Independents ranked themselves 5.72.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In this upcoming election, it is especially possible that it could be competitive,” said Rebecca Bromley-Trujillo, research director at the Wason Center.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Those surveyed support Democrat proposals on health care, immigration, environmental policy and the economy. The policy proposal with the strongest support was Medicare for all with 76 percent support among voters. A majority of Virginians support providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants (73 percent). Almost all Virginians support a pathway to citizenship for children brought to this country illegally by their parents (94 percent).</p>
<p dir="ltr">More than half of Virginians agree with implementing an environmentally friendly redesign of the state’s economy and infrastructure (65 percent); that the economic system favors the wealthy (61 percent); and that the federal minimum wage should be $15 per hour (53 percent).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bromley-Trujillo said the data indicates American culture aligns with idealism, liberty or other values often associated with conservatism. Strong support for Democratic public policy is why the commonwealth is still trending blue, even though upcoming races could still be competitive, she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Virginia voters regard Republicans as more conservative than they regard Democrats as more liberal,” Bromley-Trujillo stated. “The question is, ‘Where’s the sweet spot in this election?’”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democrats have been successful in the state because of policy ideas such as the increasing the minimum wage, and health care and child care for all Virginians, said former Richmond mayoral candidate Alexsis Rodgers, Virginia director for Care in Action, a nonprofit advocacy group for domestic workers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These aren’t partisan issues for voters,” Rodgers said. “They are ideas and policies that would actually make their lives better.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">While there is voter support for progressive policy, big elections in the commonwealth have seen progressive losses to more centrist candidates. Nearly half of Democratic voters back former Gov. Terry McAuliffe at 47 percent, with no other candidates breaking double digits, according to an April Wason Center <a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2021-04-22.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2021-04-22.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620835093662000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEey6CF7iiEtYEyz_IxK4J0Yj5GBw">poll</a>. More than a quarter of surveyed voters were undecided.</p>
<p dir="ltr">President Joe Biden defeated independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders 53 percent to 23 percent in the Virginia Democratic primary. In a somewhat closer local race, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney defeated Rodgers by 10 percentage points last November. Rodgers said that while these elections were a loss for progressive candidates, the movement is still winning by having their policy ideas adopted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Richmond For All is a political advocacy group for progressive policy. The organization has organized around local elections, education, housing justice and in opposition to a public subsidy for a Richmond-based sports arena.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In the U.S, we are still living in this Reagan-era paradigm where progressivism is still seen as harmful, and big government programs are abstractly negative,” said Quinton Robbins, political director at Richmond For All.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Robbins said that it does not matter how Virginians ideologically identify themselves. He said it does matter how progressives present ideas to everyday citizens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Virginia GOP&#8217;s nominee for governor will be former businessman and political newcomer Glenn Youngkin, who was selected after several rounds of ranked-choice voting Monday during the party&#8217;s convention.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="kjIyM2OxyB"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/05/10/virginia-gop-picks-glenn-youngkin-as-its-nominee-governor-heres-what-we-know-about-him/">Virginia GOP picks Glenn Youngkin as its nominee for governor.

<p dir="ltr">Del. Jason Miyares, R-Virginia Beach, eked out a victory over Chuck Smith, former chairman of the Virginia Beach GOP and a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, in the attorney general nomination contest. Former Del. Winsome Sears, who was the first Black woman Republican elected to the General Assembly,<a href="https://www.vpap.org/" target="_blank"> won the nomination for lieutenant governor</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Certainly, the opportunity exists for Republicans to make gains in the Virginia House, and differential partisan turnouts would be one of the reasons Republicans regain majority control, if that happens,” said Stephen Farnsworth, professor and director at the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Farnsworth also questioned if Democratic voters will turn out with the same energy as when Trump was president.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We will find out later this year whether the Republicans in the suburbs are able to win back some of the ground lost during the Trump years,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Early voting is now underway for the governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general Democratic primary elections on June 8. Republican and Democratic candidates for the House of Delegates are also on the ballot.</p>

<p dir="ltr">College and high school graduations will still look different due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but more Virginia universities are returning to in-person ceremonies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Graduations will be held online, in person or a hybrid format. Gov. Ralph Northam announced last month preliminary guidance for graduation events, which continues to be updated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The acceleration of the vaccine program and the decrease in new COVID-19 cases make it safer to ease restrictions on activities like in-person graduations,” Northam <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/march/headline-893881-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/march/headline-893881-en.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619560293356000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSz7zUAUyCcPU0HtofuK3IK6z_JA">stated</a> in March.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Graduation events for K-12 schools and colleges will operate under two sets of guidelines, depending on the date. Graduation events held outdoors before May 15 will be capped at 5,000 people or 30 percent of the venue capacity, whichever is less. Graduation events held indoors may have up to 500 people, or 30 percent of the venue capacity, whichever is less.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More people can attend graduations held on or after May 15. The governor’s <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-72-SIXTH-AMENDED-and-Order-of-Public-Health-Emergency-Nine-Easing-of-Commonsense-Surge-Restrictions-Due-to-Novel-Coronavirus-(COVID-19).pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-72-SIXTH-AMENDED-and-Order-of-Public-Health-Emergency-Nine-Easing-of-Commonsense-Surge-Restrictions-Due-to-Novel-Coronavirus-(COVID-19).pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619560293356000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFl6CALscJoTqzqO5h_5cYlSBoukg">orders </a>allow an increase to 50 percent of venue capacity or 5,000 people at outdoor graduations. Indoor events cannot exceed either 50 percent venue capacity or 1,000 persons.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Attendees must wear masks and follow other guidelines and safety protocols to ensure social distancing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond will hold a university-wide commencement ceremony online on May 15, according to a statement the university released last month. Individual departments can decide whether to hold in-person graduation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU College of Humanities and Sciences will hold <a href="https://chs.vcu.edu/commencement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chs.vcu.edu/commencement/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619560293356000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG73iWBAMKIRqLLihFuWB1_C-1Sbw">three in-person</a> graduation ceremonies outdoors on May 15. The ceremonies will be held rain or shine on an outdoor field used for sports. Guests are not allowed to attend, but the ceremonies will be livestreamed.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Britney Simmons, a senior VCU mass communications major graduating in May, has concerns about attending an in-person event.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’d prefer that graduation is online,” Simmons stated in a text message. “I’m still uncomfortable with large gatherings and wouldn’t feel comfortable with me or any of my family attending and putting their health at risk.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Federal health agencies called for a pause of the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine this month due to reports of blood clots in some individuals who received it. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration panel late last week <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-should-resume-j-j-vaccinations-warning-notice-cdc-n1265073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-should-resume-j-j-vaccinations-warning-notice-cdc-n1265073&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619560293356000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsGTE9rLpBnz7XLSMWrWSLmTp0-g">recommended</a> restarting the J&amp;J vaccinations, with an added warning about the risk of rare blood clots.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The university really put its hope in the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine and that lots of students would be vaccinated by commencement,” said Tim Bajkiewicz, an associate professor of broadcast journalism at VCU and the communications director for the VCU chapter American Association of University Professors. “Because of the pause that the CDC put on that vaccine, it really kind of blew a huge hole in those plans.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students and faculty originally scheduled to receive the one-dose J&amp;J shot had to temporarily shift to a new timetable with the incremental, two-dose shots that could make it harder for everyone to receive a vaccine by graduation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU spokesman Michael Porter did not respond to multiple requests for comment about any possible problems the university might encounter from that pause of the J&amp;J vaccine.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The ceremonies are already super stripped down,&#8221; Bajkiewicz said. &#8220;But still over this whole thing is a pronounced risk of getting COVID-19.&#8221;</p>

Graduating students are required to register and students are allowed to invite up to four guests.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Tech will also hold a virtual commencement ceremony on May 14.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sarah Hajzus, a senior industrial and systems engineering major at Virginia Tech, said she would prefer to have graduation in person.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Small, in-person [graduation], if we were to do it by major I feel like that would be ideal,” Hajzus said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The University of Virginia in Charlottesville will hold its commencement outdoors on May 21 to May 23 for the class of 2021. Students will walk the lawn and process to Scott Stadium, where each student can have two guests. The class of 2020 will also get a chance to walk and attend a special ceremony, <a href="https://majorevents.virginia.edu/messages-president-ryan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://majorevents.virginia.edu/messages-president-ryan&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619560293356000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGqOyUs3JqnSdG0M9YLoxhjmSdQvQ">according</a> to U.Va. President Jim Ryan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other Virginia universities will hold spring graduation completely online. George Mason University released a statement that its spring commencement will be held virtually. The ceremony is set for Friday, May 14 at 2 p.m.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Over 43% of the state’s population had received at least one-dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as of Monday, <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-summary/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619560293356000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMmAedq0TRGo52YIZAJFXq54bqLw">according</a> to the Virginia Department of Health.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is really sad that I won’t be able to have an in-person graduation since I looked forward to having one all four years, but I think everyone’s health is more important than a graduation ceremony,” Simmons stated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Virginia universities plan a return to campuses in the fall, but there are questions if the COVID-19 vaccine can be mandated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration only authorized the vaccine for emergency purposes, according to Lisa Lee, professor of public health at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. The vaccine does not yet have full FDA approval.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The vaccine was authorized for emergency use, so people have to be given the choice to take it and be informed of the consequences if they don&#8217;t, Lee said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Many legal scholars have interpreted that as saying that people cannot be required to take a vaccine that is under an emergency use authorization,” Lee said. “They can be when it has full approval, so that&#8217;s where the hitch is.&#8221;</p>

<p dir="ltr">“We know that young people tend to gather and that&#8217;s what really spreads this infection,” Lee said. “In this pandemic, we have to take care of ourselves for sure, but we also have to take care of each other, and the vaccine helps us do both of those things.&#8221;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Mixed reaction to mandatory vaccine</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Grey Mullarkey, a communication arts major at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, said the vaccine should be mandatory for college students and employees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The only reason I think a student should not be required to have it to come back to campus is if they have an extreme allergic reaction to vaccines,” Mullarkey said. “I think that all the anti-vax propaganda and making the vaccine a political statement is dangerous and completely counterproductive.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mullarkey received a free COVID-19 vaccine through VCU. The process was “quick, easy, and not painful,” Mullarkey said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other students said the vaccine is too new to be mandatory. Dajia Perry, a psychology major at VCU, said the vaccine shouldn’t be required until it has undergone more testing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I feel like it’s good that we have a vaccine, but I also think the process was rushed,” Perry said. “As of right now, making it mandatory would make me more reluctant to take it because I would feel like it’s being pushed on me.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Federal health agencies called for a pause of the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine this month due to reports of blood clots in some individuals who received it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0413-JJ-vaccine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0413-JJ-vaccine.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619131045311000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFygBdm9d1xT1Bu1KgsaejtJgcJkQ">said these </a>effects “appear to be extremely rare.” Virginia <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/statement-from-virginia-state-vaccination-coordinator-dr-danny-avula-on-pause-in-administration-of-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/statement-from-virginia-state-vaccination-coordinator-dr-danny-avula-on-pause-in-administration-of-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619131045311000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHj4E-hoYZUkcpBEMgLvWpw4BgxsQ">stopped</a> administering the vaccine until the investigation is complete.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Colleges instead are offering employees and students two-dose COVID-19 vaccines. Virginia Tech had sufficient availability of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, Mark Owczarski, associate vice president for university relations at Tech, said in an email.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Virginia Tech has been working with the New River Health District to avail vaccines to all our employees and to all our students,” Owczarski stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tech will continue hosting vaccination clinics until demand has been met, according to Owczarski.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU used its Moderna and Pfizer vaccine <a href="https://news.vcu.edu/health/VCU_and_VCU_Health_suspend_use_of_Johnson__Johnson_vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.vcu.edu/health/VCU_and_VCU_Health_suspend_use_of_Johnson__Johnson_vaccine&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619131045311000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHdY4GCpmH4bcYzBzo_bwSL02giFA">supply</a> to honor J&amp;J vaccine appointments on the day the latter vaccine was paused.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Fall transition to campus</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia universities are announcing a transition back to in-person classes for the fall semester.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU will offer in-person and online classes. The university <a href="https://together.vcu.edu/fall-2021-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://together.vcu.edu/fall-2021-info/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619131045311000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYRKidq-yOISRUvmyLAOAv3nvGQw">will cap</a> capacity in most buildings, and require employees and students to wear masks and complete a daily health survey.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The University of Virginia in Charlottesville will also return to <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-plans-return-person-instruction-more-normal-operations-fall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.virginia.edu/content/uva-plans-return-person-instruction-more-normal-operations-fall&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619131045311000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFtksgJXbXg1nvYPgn4_jIiLu2g6Q">in-person instruction.</a> The university will provide more details about health and safety plans by July 15.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“After a year in which the pandemic disrupted nearly everything about the UVA experience, we are eager to get back to living, learning and working together here in Charlottesville and we know you are too,” UVA President Jim Ryan, Provost Liz Magill and Chief Operating Officer J.J. Davis wrote in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tech is currently preparing for a fully <a href="https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2021/03/unirel-fall-2021-plans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2021/03/unirel-fall-2021-plans.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619131045311000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5J4iqWBEJCV6fFOL-UL65cujfng">in-person fall semester</a>. President Tim Sands stated last month that he is hopeful for a “pre-pandemic experience.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many college students are also hopeful for a return to an in-person, college experience. Greta Roberson, a student and employee at George Mason University in Fairfax, said that she and her fellow coworkers were excited about the vaccine and were among the first at Mason to get vaccinated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“George Mason is pretty liberal and open-minded, so I think the vaccine is a welcome thing for the Mason community,” Roberson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mason <a href="https://ulife.gmu.edu/president-washington-a-promising-outlook-for-the-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ulife.gmu.edu/president-washington-a-promising-outlook-for-the-fall/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619131045311000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH35tp_PYTpq6n1lYrG3j2ltYtTAg">plans</a> to offer at least 75 percent of instruction on campus and to expand residence hall capacity to “near normal levels.” Masks and testing will still be required until public health guidance changes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Forty percent of Virginians have been vaccinated with at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-summary/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619131045311000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9YXiqfbdTBehu8Z2GPnVOFhQuCA">Virginia Department of Health</a>.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Anya Sczerzenie/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">A bill allowing the public access to limited criminal investigation records will go into effect in July, along with a handful of other bills related to government transparency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Chris Hurst, D-Blacksburg, a former television reporter, introduced <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D212%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb2004&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618915635932000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5B4Oxk2pG8mKfcu-Y1-CQ5ozfkw">House Bill 2004</a>. The bill requires files related to non-ongoing criminal investigations be released under Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’d been a journalist for 10 years, and I frequently saw that access to police records was very difficult,” Hurst said. “In denying those records, accountability and transparency were lost.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hurst said he hopes the bill will give the public reasonable access to criminal investigation files.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s good governance once a case is closed to let the public see it,” Hurst said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill will allow requesters access to files including descriptions of the crime, where and when the crime was committed, the identity of the investigating officer, and a description of any injuries suffered or property stolen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Law enforcement officials and prosecutors opposed the bill, Hurst said. Journalists and victim advocates generally supported it, and many crime victims want to see their case files, Hurst said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill will benefit journalists, but they aren’t the main reason Hurst introduced the legislation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I didn’t introduce the bill on behalf of journalism,” Hurst said. “I introduced it for the people in the public who care about police accountability, to help victims get closure, and to help victims of wrongful incarceration, so we can try to achieve justice in those cases.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A public body, such as a law enforcement agency, will have longer to respond to a FOIA request that is related to a non-ongoing criminal investigation. Public bodies can now ask for up to 60 additional days as opposed to a week to provide records, as long as they communicate this to the requester and have a valid reason.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hurst introduced a similar <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=202&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB5090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D202%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3DHB5090&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618915635932000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZJCzJCAnbnhtJQEWwjCE5nrz9Aw">bill</a> during the 2020 special session. The bill narrowly passed the House but didn’t advance past subcommittee in the Senate. <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=202&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb5090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D202%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb5090&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618915635932000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdDh4Vki2SdF_lMe356njkNUEarg">HB 5090</a> expanded the scope of records made available to the public and also sought to limit the time frame for categorizing a case as “ongoing.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">HB 2004 has no time frame behind its definition of an ongoing case. An ongoing case is defined as one that has not been resolved, or in which evidence is still being gathered for future criminal cases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Megan Rhyne, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, said her organization supported HB 2004.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s not everything we wanted, by a long shot, but it’s a bill that moves us away from rejecting requests for records as a matter of policy,” Rhyne said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The legislation only pertains to closed investigations, so it will be more useful for investigative reporters writing long-term stories than for breaking news reporters, Rhyne said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This bill is aimed at at least getting the police to open up the file, look through it, and determine which parts of it can be withheld with justifications,” Rhyne said. “In the past, reporters would just be told that this material is exempt.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rhyne said the bill might also benefit the families of crime victims.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The family members of both the defendants and the victims, and victims and defendants themselves, will be able to take control of their own narrative,” Rhyne said. “During the legislative session, we had family members of two people killed in Virginia Beach who said: ‘We want to be able to see this, to see evidence from the investigation of what took our loved ones from us.’”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Legislators introduced more than 40 bills during the 2021 Virginia General Assembly sessions that would have impacted the FOIA, according to the <a href="https://www.opengovva.org/2021-legislative-bill-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.opengovva.org/2021-legislative-bill-chart&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618915635932000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSky8Ja3MeHlN8e9T5gfATgyPz5A">Virginia Coalition for Open Government.</a> The governor also signed two other FOIA-related bills, <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D212%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dsb1271&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618915635932000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFyZznQru0IBjPZE7_PwsPkHdwBbA">Senate Bill 1271</a> and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB1931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212%2Bsum%2BHB1931&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618915635933000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOe8xEZgD65VqkjrDNeKFAoVbRCA">HB 1931</a>, that apply to electronic meetings. Many government meetings have been held over Zoom and other video conferencing platforms during the pandemic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SB 1271 allows public bodies to meet electronically if a locality declares a state of emergency. Electronic meetings only were allowed previously if the governor declared a state of emergency. The bill also requires officials to allow the public to attend and comment at the meetings. Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Woodbridge, introduced the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It encourages videoconferencing, but doesn’t require it, in case small localities or public bodies don’t have broadband or funds to be able to do video,” stated Betsy Edwards, executive director of the Virginia Press Association.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB1931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212%2Bsum%2BHB1931&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618915635933000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOe8xEZgD65VqkjrDNeKFAoVbRCA">HB 1931</a> allows members of public bodies to meet electronically if a member has to take care of a relative with a medical condition and cannot attend an in-person meeting. Del. Mark Levine, D-Alexandria, introduced the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This bill was put forward to make it easier for members of public bodies to attend meetings—at any time, not just during a pandemic—by electronic means,” Edwards stated.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+HB2025ER" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212%2Bful%2BHB2025ER&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618915635933000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEc_-u47fbo0QZPqOAJ-t_G6fbSxw">HB 2025</a>, introduced by Del. Wendy Gooditis, D-Clarke County, would exempt government email distribution lists from being automatically disclosed under the FOIA law. Under current law members of the public have to “opt-out” to not have their personal information disclosed when they sign up for government email lists. The new law requires members of the public and government officials to “opt-in” to have their information publicly disclosed. FOIA advocates wanted the “opt-in” provision taken out of the bill, saying it contradicts public records policy and could bleed into other potential exemptions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bills take effect July 1.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Shayla McCartney remembers where she was when the pandemic closed her university.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It was spring break,” said McCartney, a junior at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. “I was at home with my mom, we were marathoning ‘Gilmore Girls.’ We got the email that said ‘don’t come back.’”</p>
<p dir="ltr">McCartney said she was upset at the news.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I had plans,” she said. “I had people I wanted to see.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the lives of more than half a million Virginia college students, including McCartney’s.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“My mental health plummeted, and I didn’t get to see friends,” McCartney said. “I had to come to terms with how to be alone this year.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">For young people around the world the coronavirus disrupted their education, jobs and social lives. Many universities and K-12 schools switched to online learning. Some students left campuses to live with their families, while others stayed in on-campus or off-campus housing while taking classes online.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia’s first case of COVID-19 was announced <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2021-news-releases/first-virginia-case-of-covid-19-confirmed-at-fort-belvoir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2021-news-releases/first-virginia-case-of-covid-19-confirmed-at-fort-belvoir/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616187418355000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFI847CDnSLUwKKlpgod6H135LiDA">on March 7</a>— with the first death announced a week later on March 14.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU junior Yonathan Mesfun was at his student apartment in Richmond when he received the announcement spring break was extended and in-person classes would move online.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I got everything, packed up and headed home,” said Mesfun, who lives in Northern Virginia. “I was just thinking about when it would end, honestly.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">VCU biology major Sellas Habte-Mariam was picking her sister up from track practice when she saw the email that announced the school’s closure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“My dad had been scaring me the whole time,” Habte-Mariam said. “He said ‘you’re not going back to school.’”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The sophomore said that she spent much of the quarantine period re-reading books. “My favorite is ‘Little Women,’” she said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Habte-Mariam said adjusting to online classes was difficult.</p>

<p dir="ltr">College students in the Southeastern U.S. reported higher levels of mood disorder symptoms, stress, and alcohol use during the spring 2020 semester, according to another <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33482422/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33482422/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616187418355000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGycNUkagqNbrbXmRgDrrqWToHYbg">survey</a>. These returned to pre-pandemic levels by the fall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some students faced unique challenges during the pandemic— including international students attending colleges away from their home country.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sailor Miao, a student from China, returned to his home country and started his first semester at the College of William &amp; Mary online. Miao said the 12-hour time difference made attending class difficult.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I had to wake up at 2 a.m. for class,” Miao said. “I decided to return to the U.S. because I couldn’t complete another semester online.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Miao, a political science and government major, said that the pandemic allowed him to finally spend time with his parents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’d been living with a host family for four years,” said Miao, who attended high school in Alabama through an international exchange program. “When I went back to China, I missed graduation. I was the valedictorian of my class, so it was hard.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adjusting to online learning was also difficult for students in hands-on majors, such as arts and lab sciences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">George Mason University sophomore Chandler Herr recalled being upset when his school announced it would be closing. He went back to GMU to pack his belongings, then returned home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I was disappointed, because I was supposed to work on film sets when I got back,” Herr said. “I was wondering how I could even get a grade for some of my hands-on film classes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Herr, a film and video studies major, said he and his professors “mostly gave up” during that spring semester. Remote learning meant the events and hands-on projects “couldn’t be done,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We were just flabbergasted to have it all happen,” Herr said. “It was surreal.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students have lost jobs, internships and job offers. Many say they expect to earn less at age 35 than previously anticipated, according to the <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/06/23/report-covid-19-has-hurt-college-students" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2020/06/23/report-covid-19-has-hurt-college-students&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616187418355000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENazWQf8zOYP3ds727J3m52prPeA">National Bureau of Economic Research</a>. Almost half of the students SCHEV surveyed reported concern over employment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One recent win for college students will be their first stimulus check. University students whose parents claim them as dependents did not receive stimulus checks during the early months of the pandemic. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text" target="_blank">American Rescue Plan</a>, a federal stimulus package which was signed into law on March 11, will allow college students who are dependents to claim the upcoming $1,400 stimulus checks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The number of daily vaccines given out in Virginia has risen since December. The state has administered <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines-received/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines-received/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616187418355000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZDBfghpe2zKygZMemALkGjzTKiQ">almost 2 million</a> first doses of the vaccine and almost 1 million of the second dose. College students usually fall into the lowest-priority group, and many won’t be vaccinated until late spring or early summer. Cases of COVID-19 in Virginia have been trending downward since early February.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many campuses around the state have reopened with coronavirus testing and new procedures in place.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Kim Case, director for faculty success at VCU, who oversees the Center for Teaching and Learning Excellence, said the center pivoted quickly last spring to prepare instructors to launch remote classes. Case said that she sees hope on the horizon after a year of helping colleagues navigate virtual learning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We were all pretty stressed in March 2020 and had no idea how long we would be apart,” she said. “At this point, I am much more hopeful about the future in terms of getting back on campus.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shayla McCartney said this year was disorienting, but it helped her grow.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m only just now feeling kind of comfortable,” McCartney said. “I’ve grown up a little bit. I do my schoolwork a lot more.”</p>

Danica Roem, D-Prince William.  (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cierra Parks/Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers have passed legislation banning the use of a person’s perceived or actual sexual orientation or gender identity as a defense in court for assault or murder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s done: We’re banning the gay/trans panic defense in Virginia,” Del. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, said in a</span><a href="https://twitter.com/pwcdanica/status/1365340682404175875" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roem&#8217;s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2132" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2132</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed the Senate 23-15 last week with an amendment. The House approved the amendment in a 58-39 vote. The bill now heads to Gov. Ralph Northam’s desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate amendment adds oral solicitation, or hitting on someone, as an unacceptable justification for the gay or transgender panic defense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panic defense has historically been used in cases where a member of the LGBTQ community was attacked because of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Defendants use the panic defense to justify “heat of passion” murders or assaults. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This [bill] means someone’s mere existence as an LGBTQ person does not excuse someone else and does not constitute a reasonable provocation to commit such a heat of passion attack,” Roem said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statute does not dismiss traditional self-defense lawsuits. This means LGBTQ people can still be prosecuted for attacking someone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been at least eight instances in Virginia where the panic defense was used, with the last case in 2011, according to Carsten Andresen, a researcher and criminal justice professor from Austin, Texas. He said he has tracked 200 homicide cases nationally where the panic defense was attempted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His research included five murders and three assaults in Virginia between 1973 and 2011 that Andresen said used the panic defense to justify or excuse a defendant’s violent actions. Mark Hayes murdered Tracie Gainer, a transgender woman, in 2002. Hayes claimed he</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/article_42062729-517e-50ee-bca5-9b339bd02b94.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“lost it”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and murdered Gainer after engaging in sexual intercourse. In 2011,</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/article_f2a4c2ac-67da-5a2f-9c41-34c8361cb444.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Deandre Moore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, age 18, pleaded guilty to killing 20-year-old Jacques Cowell by stabbing him multiple times. Cowell was openly gay and there were</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/news/crime/article_f2a4c2ac-67da-5a2f-9c41-34c8361cb444.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">witness accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the two had a physical relationship. Moore received a 40-year prison sentence, with 15 years suspended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In these cases, criminal defense attorneys used gay and trans panic defense to put the victim (rather than the offender) on trial,” Andresen wrote in support of the bill. He said use of the panic defense “suggests that it is permissible to commit violence” against LGBTQ people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Joseph Morrissey, D-Richmond, a former prosecutor and criminal defense lawyer, opposed of the bill, saying lawmakers should not pass laws that prohibit defendants from making a defense and that lawmakers would be going “down a very slippery slope.” Morrissey said any defendant who would offer the panic defense “would of course be rejected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, said this is not the first time Virginia has expressly prohibited a defense. Legislators repealed in 2008 the code section that provided defense from</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0174" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">carnal knowledge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when a defendant marries a child 14 years or older.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we have found an affirmative defense to be abhorrent to public policy we have gotten rid of it,” McClellan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan said she wished she could agree with Morrissey that no judge would accept the panic defense, but referred back to the Virginia cases where it was used successfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know the bill is constitutional, we know also, the bill has existing precedence, which is why it has earned overwhelming bipartisan support in state houses across the country,” Roem said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Bar Association</span><a href="https://lgbtbar.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Gay-and-Trans-Panic-Defenses-Resolution.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2013</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommended that local, state and federal legislatures curtail the availability and effectiveness of the gay and transgender panic defense. Roem said that similar bills have been implemented in other state legislatures. Virginia will become the 12th state to ban the panic defense, according to the policy organization Movement Advancement Project. The defense is also banned in the District of Columbia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently</span><a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/panic_defense_bans" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">39 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allow the panic defense to be used in cases where hate crimes resulted in the assault or murder of an LGBTQ individual. This typically results in a murder charge being lessened to a charge of manslaughter or</span><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/man-acquitted-of-murder-a_b_231748" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">acquittal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roem said she worked with Wes Bizzell, president of the National LGBT Bar Association, to prepare the bill. She also thanked Judy Shepard, the mother of Matthew Shepard, for speaking in support of the bill in committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Shepard, a gay man, was murdered in 1998 in Laramie, Wyoming. The judge</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov99/shepard110199.htm" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">barred Aaron McKinney’s defense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawyer from using the gay panic defense in the murder trial.</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/02/us/judge-rejects-gay-panic-as-defense-in-murder-case.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> McKinney</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said Shepard’s advances triggered memories of sexual abuse he suffered as a child. Police said the crime was motivated by robbery, but Shepard’s sexual orientation might </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov99/shepard110199.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made him</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the target. There were four people involved in Shepard&#8217;s killing. Two were found guilty of murder and two were charged with being an accessory after the fact to first-degree murder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roem was in high school when Matthew Shepard was murdered. She said the case had a profound effect on her and prevented her from coming out due to a fear of being ostracized and attacked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was requested to me by one of my Manassas Park student constituents who’s out, hoping not to have to live in the same fear in 2021 that I did in 1998,” Roem said of the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roem said there are people who don’t believe hate crimes happen today in Virginia. She says they do and it is time to do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to look at this from the perspective of ‘What do we do to make an affirmative statement that LGBTQ lives matter, and that you can’t just kill us for existing,” Roem said.</span></p>

Sally L. Hudson, D-Charlottesville, and <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB1276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D212%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3DSB1276&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614218699852000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEVAcCZBshB92zYg4qRpuJgM-SXxQ">Senate Bill 1276</a>, introduced by Sen. Jennifer L. McClellan, D-Richmond, loosen restrictions through Virginia’s health insurance exchange. The exchange offers health insurance to approximately 270,000 Virginians who are self employed or don’t have access to insurance through employers, according to the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/2020-federal-health-insurance-exchange-enrollment-period-final-weekly-enrollment-snapshot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/2020-federal-health-insurance-exchange-enrollment-period-final-weekly-enrollment-snapshot&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1614218699852000&amp;usg=AFQjCNExVajCeMj6D-eR2UJd07C9c-RP0w">Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although the legislation will allow insurers to provide these services, it will not require them to do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The current restriction on abortion coverage through Virginia’s health insurance exchange was put in place in 2011 during Republican Gov. Robert McDonnell’s administration after the Affordable Care Act was passed. Federal funds can’t cover abortion costs due to the Hyde Amendment, except for specific circumstances.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The current ban on providing abortion care for private insurance companies does nothing to promote or protect the health and safety of anyone — it’s purely politically based,” said Rae Pickett, communications director for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OtCWaPTBAq"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/01/22/virginia-senate-repeals-ban-on-abortion-coverage-for-plans-offered-through-state-exchange/">Virginia Senate repeals ban on abortion coverage for plans offered through state exchange</a></p></blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">“Abortion is the only legal medical procedure that is prohibited by Virginia law from even being offered by private companies that sell plans through an exchange,” McClellan said during the bill’s committee hearing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jamie Lockhart, executive director at Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia, called the current ban the “ultimate government overreach.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Advocates for the bill said banning abortion services through insurance companies disproportionately affects lower-income individuals, and the bill will allow access for more people to get needed care. Pickett said customers can currently choose a plan from the marketplace that fits their needs such as ones that offer different kinds of contraception.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Abortion should be the same way,” Pickett said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The votes on both measures were along party lines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Opponents of the legislation fear the measures could “grease the wheels” for state funding of abortion. Olivia Gans Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, is concerned that a repeal of the Hyde Amendment by the Democratic majority Congress could lead to state money being used to fund abortions. Turner said Virginians may be supportive of legal abortion, but there is “a great deal of opposition to taxpayer funding of elective abortions.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Turner said it could become difficult to find a plan in the market that does not include abortion services. The bill’s passage could lead to more expensive plans for consumers since more services would be covered, Turner said.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> W. Bruce Vogel, an associate professor in the Department of Health Outcomes and Biomedical Informatics at the University of Florida, specializes in health care economics. He expects the law to have limited impact since only a small fraction of health insurance marketplace users have abortions in a year.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “More worrisome may be whether a low-income pregnant woman can pay the bill out-of-pocket in the absence of insurance coverage,” Vogel said in an email. “Beyond the first-term, abortion costs can rise into the thousands of dollars, and that is big hurdle if you are poor.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Juneteenth has officially become a state holiday after lawmakers unanimously approved legislation during the Virginia General Assembly&#8217;s special session.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Juneteenth marks the day news of the Emancipation Proclamation reached Texas, which was the last state to abolish slavery. The <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202+sum+SB5031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202%2Bsum%2BSB5031&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1603230824033000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6chzsxEs6VrqNAUFMHg9dL7TFCg">companion bills</a> were introduced by Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, and Del. Lamont Bagby, D-Richmond. Gov. Ralph Northam signed the legislation on Oct. 13.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Juneteenth is the oldest celebration of the end of slavery in the United States,” Northam said during a press conference held that day. “It’s time we elevate this, not just a celebration by and for some in Virginia, but one acknowledged and celebrated by all of us.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Joshua Cole, D-Fredericksburg,<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1160&amp;201+sum+HB1160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201%2Bsum%2BHB1160%26201%2Bsum%2BHB1160&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1603230824033000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGSkC9lkRjmEBwejSFDJTYSp3svyQ"> introduced a bill </a>in the regular legislative session earlier this year to recognize Juneteenth, but the proposal didn’t advance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Northam proposed making Juneteenth a state holiday in June during a press conference that included musician and Virginia-native Pharrell Williams. Northam signed an executive order that gave executive branch employees and state colleges the day off. Some Virginia localities, such as <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/city-of-richmond-to-observe-juneteenth-as-a-paid-holiday" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/city-of-richmond-to-observe-juneteenth-as-a-paid-holiday&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1603230824033000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE5z9rKhqyGjwGPuMDCIpx7eJXnYw">Richmond</a> and several<a href="https://www.dailypress.com/government/local/dp-nw-juneteenth-localities-20200618-zbbrutqqhbektcmqj4w3i2egru-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dailypress.com/government/local/dp-nw-juneteenth-localities-20200618-zbbrutqqhbektcmqj4w3i2egru-story.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1603230824033000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFIhRBu8nFKfKS5OJTdCm7jLI9ARQ"> places in Hampton Roads,</a> also observed the holiday this year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think it is overdue that the commonwealth formally honor and celebrate the emancipation and end of slavery,” Del. Mark Cole, R-Fredericksburg, a co-patron of the bill, said in an email. “It was a step towards fulfilling the promise of equality contained in our founding documents.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Elegba Folklore Society, a Richmond-based organization focused on promoting African culture, history and arts, is one of the groups that has been celebrating the holiday for decades. The celebration usually is a three-day weekend event that looks at the history of Juneteenth. A torch-lit walk down the Trail of Enslaved Africans in Richmond is also held, said Janine Bell, the society’s president and artistic director.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We take time to just say thank you to our ancestors, their contributions, their forfeitures, their trials and tribulations,” Bell said. “We invite people to Richmond’s African burial ground so that we can go there and pay homage from a perspective of African spirituality.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Juneteenth should not be used as another holiday to look for bargains in stores, Bell said. It should be a time for reflection about liberty, as well as for celebration and family strengthening.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s a time for optimism and joy,” Bell said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Elegba Folklore Society broadcasted its Juneteenth event online this year due to the coronavirus. Although there were still around 7,000 views, Bell said that it is usually much larger and has international influence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cries for police reform and social justice continue to increase, Bell said. More attention is being drawn to the racial disparities across America. With this, people have been changing their priorities concerning issues such as discrimination.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This was a step towards equity,” Bell said about the bill. “A symbolic step, but a step nonetheless.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">State workers will be off during Juneteenth. If the job requires individuals to come in to work, then they will be compensated with overtime or extra pay, said Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, a patron for the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The General Assembly wrapped up the agenda last week for the special session that began Aug. 18. Northam called the session to update the state budget and to address criminal and social justice reform and issues related to COVID-19.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><strong>By Ada Romano/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">A General Assembly bill is likely dead for the session that would have held localities accountable for damages caused by protesters if an adequate police response was not provided.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Mark Cole, R-Fredericksburg, said he proposed <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202+sum+HB5026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202%2Bsum%2BHB5026&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1601601633051000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEOk_DmsTrROrMvOBMIUYugvDOAyg">House Bill 5026</a> to assure localities provide proper police protection during protests in an effort to minimize damages to personal property and businesses. The bill was referred to the House Courts of Justice committee in August but has not been addressed, and probably won’t be according to its sponsor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Protests have erupted around the state and nation since May, with demonstrators calling for social justice and police reform after George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis. The protests touched off again last week after a grand jury indicted on wanton endangerment charges one out of three officers involved in the death of Breonna Taylor, a Kentucky woman who died after police serving a warrant opened fire in her apartment after being shot at by a man inside.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cole submitted the bill in response to what he said was Virginia local government officials ordering police to stand down and not break up unlawful protests that included rioting and looting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It should be obvious now, that you cannot count on Democrats to keep you safe,” Cole said. “When violent protests hit, they order the police to back off and let rioters run wild.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Buildings and vehicles were burned in Richmond in the initial days of protests following Floyd’s death, including a public transit bus. There was widespread property damage throughout the city which included graffiti, broken windows and stolen property.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Richmond Police Department instituted an 8 p.m. curfew a few days later and the Virginia State Police department, along with other local counties, began providing additional support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Richmond Fire Department recently estimated that the city saw nearly $4 million in fire damage in the first 18 days of protests, according to a <a href="https://richmond.com/news/virginia/ap/richmond-saw-nearly-4m-in-fire-damage-during-initial-unrest/article_6bce287e-428b-5742-9d2c-6fa790b6dd0c.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmond.com/news/virginia/ap/richmond-saw-nearly-4m-in-fire-damage-during-initial-unrest/article_6bce287e-428b-5742-9d2c-6fa790b6dd0c.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1601601633051000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGEf0USrzdUfi0WGR64je9eMVvL1g">report by the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>. Police spent more than $1.6 million on overtime pay during the first month of protests in Richmond, according to<a href="https://richmondbizsense.com/2020/07/16/protest-response-cost-city-police-1-7m-over-30-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondbizsense.com/2020/07/16/protest-response-cost-city-police-1-7m-over-30-days/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1601601633051000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmYVrCeclydMNvjkISyFaM2HnFtA"> a report by Richmond BizSense</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Protests have included calls from demonstrators to defund the police. Cole said defunding police would make communities less safe, and early police intervention could prevent situations from turning violent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“People pay taxes for police protection, so if local elected officials withhold that protection, they should be held liable for the results of their actions,” Cole said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Steve Neal, an author and retired Chesterfield County police captain, said the bill contradicts a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/justices-rule-police-do-not-have-a-constitutional-duty-to-protect.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/justices-rule-police-do-not-have-a-constitutional-duty-to-protect.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1601601633051000&amp;usg=AFQjCNElHWkcpa3N7g8U8wUeT-neWu6ERQ">2005 Supreme Court ruling</a> stating police have “no duty” to protect civilians from harm from another person.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Neal said the language in the bill is too vague to enforce and said he felt an obligation to protect citizens since becoming a law enforcement officer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Every police officer I’ve ever known, including myself, would risk their lives trying to protect other people. That’s what we do on a daily basis,” Neal said. “The police are actually doing that even though the law says we don’t exactly have that duty.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The staff of the Commission on Local Government analyzed the bill’s fiscal impact and collected responses from several localities. The Commission wrote that a majority of localities said the bill would likely raise insurance premiums and legal fees because it could increase litigation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A Virginia Beach representative questioned what evidence would have to be submitted or found to prove a locality “intentionally” or “negligently” provided an inadequate police response.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A Wise County representative stated: “What is adequate in my mind may not be adequate in the minds of others.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"> A representative from the town of Marion stated: “This could open Pandora&#8217;s Box for localities already suffering from reduced police staffing and increased incidents of civil unrest.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Activist Jessica Moore has been at the forefront of Richmond protests. She said she became more involved in the movement after learning about the lack of protection against COVID-19 in the Richmond City Justice Center, where her friend is incarcerated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s become a lot more passionate for me just because no one else is listening. Our mayor is not listening, our governor is not listening,” Moore said. “We’re going to take matters into our own hands.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Moore, along with thousands who protested in Richmond over the past five months, advocates defunding the Richmond Police Department. She said it’s essential to reallocate tax dollars to schools and other community services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If they’re going to continue to fund the police, then the funds need to be spread out into programs to teach them to work with people with mental illnesses and other training to help them be more sensitive to certain situations,” Moore said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moore believes less response is needed, not more, as Cole’s bill proposes. Moore said the police are provided tear gas and other weapons, which are unnecessary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Legislators advanced several bills regarding criminal justice reform during the General Assembly special session, which kicked off in August to tackle criminal justice reform, the budget and other issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cole said that he has not decided if he will introduce the same bill in the next session.</p>

Douglas Wilder School of Government shows presidential candidate Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Mark Warner leading by double-digit margins in the commonwealth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Richmond-based university conducted a telephone poll of just over 800 adults from Aug. 28 to Sept. 7.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The results show Democratic nominee Biden ahead of President Donald Trump by 14 percentage points (53% to 39%). Warner, a Democrat who has represented Virginia in Congress for more than a decade, is ahead of his Republican challenger Daniel Gade by 17 percentage points (55% to 38%). The poll had a margin of error of 5.17 percentage points for all adults sampled and 6.22 percentage points for likely voters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden is leading in the Northern, South Central and Tidewater regions of the state, while Trump leads in Western and Northwestern Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stephen Farnsworth, director at the Fredericksburg-based University of Mary Washington Center for Leadership and Media Studies, said that Trump’s message resonates with rural voters in the western part of the state.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“His focus on the message of Christian conservatives resonates well in rural areas,” Farnsworth said. “Trump has appointed politically conservative judges, and Christians have been well served by him.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Farnsworth said that Trump tends to lose in suburban areas of Virginia such as Northern Virginia, where voters tend to be socially progressive but fiscally conservative.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The poll also provided insight into the demographics of Biden voters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Something that was interesting was the strength of women as an indicator of support for Biden,” said Farrah Stone, who directed the VCU poll.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Women were more likely to support Biden over Trump by 22 percentage points (58% to 36%). Men preferred Biden over Trump by five percentage points (47% to 42%). In July, a Wilder School poll found that men were more likely to say they would vote for Trump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The poll also shows Biden’s nomination of Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as his running mate does not significantly affect his support among women or minorities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you’re looking at Kamala Harris, there aren’t significant differences between whites and minorities, or men and women,” Stone said. “What was significant was whether you were a Democrat or Republican.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Farnsworth said that vice presidential candidates often don’t change people’s votes, but they can help a candidate by increasing turnout among people who support the candidate but wouldn’t otherwise vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If Biden’s pick of Harris ramps up turnout among African American voters, then that was a smart decision by Biden,” Farnsworth said. “This election is largely frozen in place; there aren’t many voters who are undecided.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hillary Clinton secured a Democratic victory in the commonwealth during the last presidential race, beating Trump by over <a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:2016/year_to:2016/office_id:1/stage:General" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/search/year_from:2016/year_to:2016/office_id:1/stage:General&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1600464563040000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLFtmdoxazhBjC1X2bGwjvQ1i05A">212,000 votes.</a> The 2016 turnout of registered voters was higher than in 2012, but lower than 2008, according to the Virginia Department of Elections.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The poll also asked voters about an issue that has recently come to the forefront of election news: the reliability of mail-in voting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginians are split on whether mail-in voting is trustworthy. When combined, 50% of respondents are “somewhat or very confident” that mail-in votes will be accurately cast and counted, while a combined 48% are not too or not at all confident about the process. Trust in mail-in voting is affected by party affiliation, with a majority of Republicans finding it untrustworthy, according to the VCU poll.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The differences are significant across party lines, which line up with voting and support for Trump,” Stone said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sixty-seven percent of Republicans said they were “not at all” or “not too” confident in the accuracy of mail-in ballots.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Trump has tried to increase public doubts about mail-in voting,” Farnsworth said. “No previous candidates have emphasized mail-in voting this much, but it’s never been this significant before.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">An effort to require Virginia school districts provide in-person classes to students with poor internet access during the COVID-19 pandemic is most likely dead.</p>
<p dir="ltr">House Bill<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202+sum+HB5009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202%2Bsum%2BHB5009&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1600215654740000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFkfsHAOOs1Xu_7fFU-28aEDDrL7w"> 5009</a>, introduced by Del. Mark Cole, R-Fredericksburg, would require public schools to offer in-person classes to elementary, middle and high school students who have substandard internet connections at home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was referred in August to the House Committee on Education during the Virginia General Assembly special session, but the legislation still hasn’t been addressed as the legislature nears crossover day—when each chamber must act on bills for them to advance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Anything still left in committee, will essentially die. So it doesn’t look like this bill will progress,” Del. Joshua Cole, D-Fredericksburg, who co-sponsored the bill, said in an email.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mark Cole’s bill would have required schools to provide in-person instruction to individuals who can’t access an internet speed of more than 10 megabits per second download and one Mbps upload.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is an equity issue,” Mark Cole wrote in an email earlier this month. “Some children do not have access to the internet or internet of sufficient capacity to be able participants in online instruction, primarily rural and poor children.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">More than 1 million public school students were slated to start school in an online-only format, according to<a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/2020-school-division-reopening-status/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/2020-school-division-reopening-status/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1600215654741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFI5ljxERUQ1hOYO0WYfMh7Nb6ILw"> data posted</a> in August by the Virginia Public Access Project.

More than 269,000 children were set to start school in a hybrid format that offers in-person and online instruction.

<p dir="ltr">Russell County in Southwest Virginia is among the schools offering an in-person and online learning format. The school has set up an internet hotspot on school grounds to help students download material for class, and zip drives to store what they download, according to Janice Barton, a teacher at the school. High schools in the surrounding area have also done the same, Barton said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though schools are offering ways to access the internet, they’re still not offering high-speed access, Mark Cole said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This still puts children without high speed internet at a disadvantage over those that can participate in the comfort of their homes,” he said. “Children have to be driven to a hotspot, often a school parking lot, where they try to receive instruction while sitting in their car.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Joshua Cole believes children should have an equal opportunity to learn without having to worry about attending online classes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you don’t have internet, if you don’t have high speed internet, if your speeds are low, we want to make sure that your student is not left out,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stafford County gives some students an <a href="https://fredericksburg.com/news/local/education/stafford-king-george-schools-to-start-virtually-on-monday/article_91a95c6c-afad-5874-a87c-e544db291309.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://fredericksburg.com/news/local/education/stafford-king-george-schools-to-start-virtually-on-monday/article_91a95c6c-afad-5874-a87c-e544db291309.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1600215654741000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHIJoSmmz1Nqcb-zvHxLXy4mCrbcA">opportunity to come to school</a> if they need to, said Joshua Cole, who is one of the county’s representatives in the House. The lawmaker said only some students are attending in-person classes in Stafford County, primarily students with disabilities or those without reliable internet access.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It&#8217;s not a bunch of students coming in,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fredericksburg City Public Schools partnered with business owners in the area who are helping fund internet hotspots for students to access from their homes, according to Joshua Cole.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many schools that are offering in-person instruction have created spaces to accommodate students and follow social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have signs in the hallways, in our classrooms. We have it set up 6 feet apart,” Barton said. “We have cleaning supplies, every teacher has that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Russell County Public Schools also provide students and teachers with masks, Barton said.</p>

Ryan McDougle, R-Mechanicsville, had similar wording to Mark Cole’s bill, but it was passed by indefinitely, which means the bill is dead unless the committee takes additional action.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">As more universities open, they’re collecting and releasing COVID-19 data and grappling with contingency plans for those who contract the disease.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Virginia in Charlottesville released its first set of COVID-19 <u><a href="https://returntogrounds.virginia.edu/covid-tracker" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://returntogrounds.virginia.edu/covid-tracker&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598639273384000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsPNmHwuW5FTYYYGcQW209AbN77Q" target="_blank">testing data</a></u> on Wednesday. There have been 58 total positive cases at the university since Aug. 17, including 31 students. The university’s quarantine rooms are currently 5% occupied and the isolation rooms are not occupied.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Students living off-Grounds will be expected to quarantine or isolate at their off-Grounds housing,” the university wrote in its<u><a href="https://returntogrounds.virginia.edu/public-health-measures" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://returntogrounds.virginia.edu/public-health-measures&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598639273384000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7aJH0E9b6Jmb-TnWUJQeGjSNkEw" target="_blank"> p</a><a href="https://returntogrounds.virginia.edu/public-health-measures" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://returntogrounds.virginia.edu/public-health-measures&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598639273384000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7aJH0E9b6Jmb-TnWUJQeGjSNkEw" target="_blank">ublic</a><a href="https://returntogrounds.virginia.edu/public-health-measures" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://returntogrounds.virginia.edu/public-health-measures&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598639273384000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7aJH0E9b6Jmb-TnWUJQeGjSNkEw" target="_blank"> health plan</a></u>. “Students who can safely travel home to isolate or quarantine will be encouraged to do so.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The university is exploring monitoring COVID-19 among the student population by testing wastewater from certain buildings and is considering point prevalence surveys, which test every person in a certain area or building regardless of symptoms.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia also has an <u><a href="https://communityconcerns.virginia.edu/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://communityconcerns.virginia.edu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598639273384000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0cEuMrVor7pD-gWZVRHjeSKYoeA" target="_blank">online portal</a></u> for students and those in the surrounding community to report infractions of the university’s coronavirus policies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">James Madison University in Harrisonburg debuted its <u><a href="https://www.jmu.edu/stop-the-spread/dashboard.shtml" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jmu.edu/stop-the-spread/dashboard.shtml&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598639273384000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvzGjXtLm-vDwYyYQrXi0joqR2tQ" target="_blank">COVID-19 dashboard</a></u> Tuesday, which showed 125 positive cases mostly tied to students. Fifteen JMU students on campus tested positive since July 1 and 107 self-reported their positive test results since Aug. 17. Three employees also self-reported positive results since then. The university has tested almost 820 students since July 1. Eleven students that live off-campus and are affiliated with the same organization tested positive, JMU said Wednesday.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“If [students] need to isolate or need to quarantine, we are asking that they do so at home, where they can be supported by family or friends if that’s possible,” said Caitlyn Read, JMU spokesperson.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">JMU can provide students that cannot return home to quarantine or isolate with a space to do so, Read said. The university health center staff checks on the students daily, provides them with food and makes sure they have access to coursework, Read said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As of Thursday, JMU had 14<u><a href="https://www.jmu.edu/stop-the-spread/dashboard.shtml" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jmu.edu/stop-the-spread/dashboard.shtml&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598639273384000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvzGjXtLm-vDwYyYQrXi0joqR2tQ" target="_blank"> beds</a></u> occupied for students in isolation or quarantine out of 143 available beds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Various factors will determine if JMU goes to a virtual format for all classes, including the number of cases on campus and isolation and quarantine space available on campus, Read said. She also said the amount of personal protective equipment available for health workers on campus and the COVID-19 positivity rate in Harrisonburg will be considered.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond added<u><a href="https://together.vcu.edu/dashboard/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://together.vcu.edu/dashboard/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598639273384000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbPc7ieqSSqg3HddH_3LJ7EPTvwA" target="_blank"> prevalence testing data</a></u> to its COVID-19 dashboard, logging 70 tests with one positive COVID-19 result as of Thursday, for a 1.4% positivity rate. <u><a href="https://together.vcu.edu/news/volunteers-prevalence-tests/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://together.vcu.edu/news/volunteers-prevalence-tests/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1598639273384000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFIMGOzaWrp_8RtuS6-wvnJt2Ov7A" target="_blank">VCU’s prevalence testing</a></u> program tests asymptomatic people within the university, including employees and about 5% of students that live on campus and about 2% of students that do not.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">VCU had 110 active cases on campus as of Thursday&#8211;98 students and a dozen employees. The university reported a cluster of 44 cases within the athletic department, forcing it to open an isolation space at the former Honors college dorm. VCU reported 167 students are in on-campus quarantine or isolation. The cases have increased 205% since the dashboard launched a week ago with 36 total cases.</p>

</p><p><strong>By Andrew Ringle</strong></p>
<p>A bill that could reshape how law enforcement responds when someone is experiencing a mental health crisis reported out of the House Public Safety Committee on Tuesday by a vote of 13-9.</p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?202+sum+HB5043" target="_blank">House Bill 5043</a> by Del. Jeff Bourne, D-Richmond, would create teams of mental health service providers, peer recovery specialists and law enforcement to help individuals in a crisis situation. Formally dubbed the mental health awareness response and community understanding services, or MARCUS, alert system, the proposal is in response to ongoing demands of protesters in Richmond.</p>
<p>The proposed system is named after Marcus-David Peters, a 24-year-old high school biology teacher and Virginia Commonwealth University alumnus who <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime/update-prosecutor-says-deadly-police-shooting-of-marcus-david-peters-was-justifiable-homicide-report-shows/article_2881439b-5c91-5edb-982e-edad8671b5b4.html" target="_blank">was shot and killed</a> after charging at a Richmond Police officer following a vehicle pursuit in 2018. Peters was unarmed and experiencing a mental health crisis.</p>
<p>“Out of that, his family, a wealth and host of community advocates and stakeholders came together and really started developing what’s known as the MARCUS alert system, which this bill hopefully will create,” Bourne said during the virtual committee meeting.</p>
<p>The bill would require the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and the Department of Criminal Justice Services to work together to create evidence-based training programs for the care teams so that they know how, Bourne said, “to effectively address, mitigate and de-escalate these situations.”</p>
<p>Bourne hopes the law will ensure that people who are experiencing mental health crises are met with the appropriate resources “and not just being locked up.”</p>
<p>“A mental health professional is going to absolutely take the lead in these situations,” Bourne said. “In lots of cases, the mere presence or sight of a uniform or police vehicle can further exacerbate or further amplify the mental health crisis.”</p>
<p>Princess Blanding, sister of Peters, commended Bourne and his team for spearheading the bill’s progress in the House. She called today’s committee meeting a partial victory, adding “it’s not done yet.”</p>
<p>“We’re very thankful for the work that Del. Jeff Bourne has been doing, and it’s not over,” Blanding said. “He knows he still has a lot of work ahead of him, and he’s up for it. He’s up for that fight.”</p>
<p>During the meeting, Blanding urged the delegates to support the bill and said her brother “absolutely deserved help, not death” on the day of his fatal shooting.</p>
<p>“When a person’s kidneys stop functioning properly, they receive dialysis if needed,” Blanding said. “When a person’s heart stops functioning properly, they receive bypass surgery if needed. But the brain is the only major organ that, when it stops functioning properly, we demonize, we incarcerate, and in the case of so many Black people, death is the final answer.”</p>
<p>Blanding has spoken at multiple demonstrations in Richmond since protests sparked by the death of George Floyd began in late May, demanding the city fully fund the alert system as well as establish a civilian review board to investigate allegations of police misconduct.</p>
<p>Citing the personal experience of a family member, Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, expressed concern for situations when a victim is endangered by someone experiencing a mental health crisis. She said she supports Bourne’s bill “in concept” but struggles with it from a legal perspective regarding who would respond first in a situation when someone might be harmed.</p>
<p>Bourne said law enforcement have “an absolute, overarching duty to protect people,” and that protection of any victims would necessitate police to respond first, but the mental health team would also be there to address the crisis. Coyner ultimately voted against the bill.</p>
<p>Republican delegates expressed concern over how to fund a statewide system, which will be determined when the bill is before the House Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>“I’d like for us to think about what we could do to spend this money within our police departments to have somebody there with them that has the ability to be plainclothed and to do this, versus trying to organize different people from different parts,” said Del. Matt Fariss, R-Rustburg.</p>
<p>Bruce Cruser, executive director of Mental Health America of Virginia, spoke during the committee meeting. He said although his organization was not involved with putting forward the legislation, he “fully supports” the goals listed in the bill.</p>
<p>“I think this is an incredible, significant step forward in really addressing the mental health needs of our community,” Cruser said.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 5038, introduced by Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Woodbridge, also seeks to establish a similar alert system. It has been rereferred to the Senate Finance and Appropriations committee.</p>

The next deadline for all food vendors to eliminate use of such containers would be July 1, 2025. Carr’s bill exempts institutions such as schools and correctional facilities from the ban.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill passed the House (55-44) and the Senate passed it (23-13) with an amendment proposed by Sen. David R. Suetterlein, R-Roanoke. The amendment adds a reenactment clause stipulating the bill will not be enacted until it is voted on and passed again next year by the General Assembly.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> The House overwhelming (99-1) rejected the amendment, and the Senate didn’t budge, insisting (38-1) on the reenactment clause. As of Feb. 27, the bill was assigned to a conference committee to debate its fate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Co-patron Del. Paul E. Krizek, D-Fairfax, said the reenactment clause is “a way to kick the can down the road.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I was really hoping that we had come to a good compromise,” Krizek said, in reference to the two deadlines given to vendors to stop distributing polystyrene materials.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Krizek’s bill HB 1046 was incorporated into Carr’s bill. He said his bill stemmed from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/us/maine-ban-styrofoam-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/us/maine-ban-styrofoam-trnd/index.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583357195461000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFeXm3gpAIQXCxeJT9ryUKWpO_w5g">Maine’s prohibition of polystyrene containers</a> that passed in 2019.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Nothing we use for a few minutes should be allowed to pollute our oceans and rivers and threaten wildlife for centuries,” Krizek said via email.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Expanded polystyrene foam, widely known as Styrofoam, breaks down into small pieces and takes an estimated hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade, according to Elly Boehmer, the state director of Environment Virginia. The organization is an affiliate of Environment America, which works to advocate for environmental issues locally and nationally.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Polystyrene is one of the most commonly found types of litter,” Boehmer said. “By reducing this type of litter from being an option in our environment, it would do a lot to protect our wildlife and our ecosystems.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Environment Virginia launched a campaign called “<a href="https://environmentvirginia.org/feature/vae/wildlife-over-waste" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://environmentvirginia.org/feature/vae/wildlife-over-waste&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583357195461000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHQCp1MGzDzrCaCb2Q4-y63fTCoog">Wildlife Over Waste</a>” in <a href="https://environmentamerica.org/news/ame/environment-america%E2%80%99s-new-campaign-wildlife-over-waste" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://environmentamerica.org/news/ame/environment-america%25E2%2580%2599s-new-campaign-wildlife-over-waste&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583357195461000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQRAS0TGQ3BAuSvbu7-D-YUEZS5g">2018</a> with the goal to reduce the use of plastic foam cups and containers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The organization campaigned across the state and gathered enough signed petitions to meet with Carr and draft the bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carr said in an email interview that she introduced the bill because polystyrene is a serious contributor to pollution and poses a health risk to humans and animals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Businesses that still use polystyrene containers after the deadlines will receive a civil penalty up to $50 for each day of violation. Food vendors may be granted a one year exemption under the basis of “undue economic hardship,” such as inability to obtain alternatives to polystyrene containers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alternatives to plastic foam containers include recyclable materials such as biodegradable paper or plastics, which can be more expensive. However, the additional cost would be minimal if it is passed on to consumers, Boehmer said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It does reduce the cost of picking up litter and the cost is quite small,” Boehmer said. “If you get a $10 meal that comes in a to-go container, the additional cost would be less than 1% of that added to your total cost.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill also empowers the <a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/Programs/LandProtectionRevitalization/RecyclingandLitterPreventionPrograms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.deq.virginia.gov/Programs/LandProtectionRevitalization/RecyclingandLitterPreventionPrograms.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583357195462000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGHMt0I3LzYQ3sl7FJMwa77HrkGvQ">Litter Control and Recycling Fund Advisory Board</a>, which works to eliminate littering while encouraging recycling, to help oversee a newly established Litter Control and Recycling Fund. Any collected civil penalties will go directly into the fund. The advisory board’s proposed additional responsibilities include raising public awareness on the dangers of polystyrene and promoting alternatives to plastic foam containers.</p>

(Christophe Genty Photography)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Zach Armstrong/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"> When William Christiansen married his college sweetheart, he was disturbed that they had to disclose their race to the registrar, considering they are an interracial couple.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It reminded me and my wife of a time when interracial couples were unable to get married,” said Christiansen. “It&#8217;s an unneeded reminder of the discriminatory practices that dominated the South during Jim Crow.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both chambers of the General Assembly passed legislation to eliminate the race requirement on the marriage license application. Under <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB62" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201%2Bsum%2BSB62&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583276726530000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGV-lS1yCAZXWfqFS13wDBs0yEENA">Senate Bill 62</a>, married couples will not have to disclose their race when filing marriage records, divorce and annulment reports to the state registrar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was introduced by Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke. The legislation moved through every committee and legislative chamber without opposition from any lawmaker.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Asking for race seems completely unrelated to whether a state should recognize a marriage,” Christiansen said. “It sends a signal that those in charge of policy related to marriage applications care little about removing the legacy of discriminatory practices of their predecessors.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Under <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title32.1/chapter7/section32.1-267/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title32.1/chapter7/section32.1-267/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583276726530000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-hFdQaU-SJ3KIfhgdLetMb_TAXA">current law</a>, the race of the marrying parties along with other personal data is filed with the state registrar when a marriage is performed in the commonwealth.</p>

The lawsuit resulted in Attorney General Mark Herring declaring that couples applying for marriages would not be forced to disclose their race to the registrar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is another Jim Crow law that should have been out of the books and I’m so grateful that the younger generation isn&#8217;t judging people based on color of skin,” said Sen. Lionell Spruill Sr., D-Chesapeake.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In October 2019, a federal judge <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/judge-strikes-down-virginia-race-requirement-for-marriage-license-as-unconstitutional/2019/10/11/9da6d388-ec73-11e9-85c0-85a098e47b37_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/judge-strikes-down-virginia-race-requirement-for-marriage-license-as-unconstitutional/2019/10/11/9da6d388-ec73-11e9-85c0-85a098e47b37_story.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583276726530000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGxdkAZwj8jq9z3nxxBxsFr5KbIGQ">struck down</a> the race requirement as unconstitutional. Judge Rossie D. Alston Jr. found that the law violated due process under the 14th Amendment. Alston said the law didn’t hold scrutiny against the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This new generation is much different,” Spruill said. “During my time, whites and blacks were thought of more differently.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other measures to repeal antiquated state laws were introduced during the 2020 General Assembly session. The General Assembly passed <a href="https://apnews.com/0e3bbd5f435f3d83dc2c56e3500f3c2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apnews.com/0e3bbd5f435f3d83dc2c56e3500f3c2b&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583276726530000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGh4wHctMH7LxA257dtsaKpLVMrzg">legislation</a> that removes the crime of premarital sex, currently a Class 4 misdeameanor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are looking at old laws created by an older white establishment and just removing those,” Spruill said. “It&#8217;s another step to say whites and blacks have the right to do what they want to do.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia is home to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1966/395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1966/395&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1583276726530000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLXVUkgrFde4vz4M2j1mM2ATllVw">Loving v. Virginia</a> that overturned laws banning interracial marriage. In 1958, a judge sentenced Richard and Mildred Loving to a year in prison for marrying each other. He suspended the sentence for 25 years if the couple moved to the District of Columbia. After the Supreme Court of Virginia upheld their sentences, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned their convictions. The court found that the law violated equal protection and due process under the 14th Amendment.</p>

<p>The state Senate voted Tuesday in favor of a bill that would prohibit holding a phone while driving a motor vehicle on Virginia roadways and which implements a penalty for the traffic violation.</p>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb874" target="_blank">House Bill 874</a> will head to the desk of Gov. Ralph Northam, who has voiced support for prohibiting the use of handheld cellphones while driving. The measure, sponsored by Del. Jeff Bourne, D-Richmond, would go into effect at the start of 2021.</p>
<p>“I’m happy that HB874 passed 29-9 in the Senate,” Bourne said in an email. “HB874 will make our roadways safer for all Virginians by prohibiting drivers from holding a cell phone while driving a motor vehicle.”</p>
<p>The House of Delegates approved the bill Feb. 5 with a 72-24 vote after incorporating four bills with similar proposals. Violations of the measures in HB 874 would result in a fine of $125 for the first offense and $250 for subsequent offenses. If a violation occurs in a highway work zone, there would be a mandatory fee of $250.</p>
<p>Bourne said the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus, of which he is a member, supports making Virginia roadways safer without risking “disparate application of law.”</p>
<p>“We were happy to work with Drive Smart Virginia to improve the legislation to ensure that the new law is applied fairly and equitably,” Bourne said.</p>
<p>Hands-free driving garners bicameral and bipartisan support, according to Brantley Tyndall, director of outreach for Bike Walk RVA. He said the defeat of previous bills with similar measures in past years was deflating, but that Bourne’s latest proposal reworked the language to make it successful.</p>
<p>Tyndall called Bourne’s bill a “commonsense safety measure” and said he was glad to see support for the bill from old and new leadership in the General Assembly.</p>
<p>“We can all feel a part of saving dozens or hundreds of lives over the next few years, including the one out of every six traffic fatalities that is a person walking or biking,” Tyndall said.</p>
<p>Current law prohibits reading or typing messages on a personal communications device while driving. However, holding such a device is legal, except while driving in a work zone.</p>
<p>The bill would not apply to emergency vehicle drivers, such as police officers and firefighters, nor employees of the Department of Transportation while performing official duties. It would also exempt drivers who are parked legally or at a full stop.</p>
<p>Last fall, Richmond City Council unanimously passed an ordinance to ban using mobile devices while driving. With a signature from Northam, HB 874 would make the same policy statewide law.</p>
<p><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb932" target="_blank">Senate Bill 932</a> proposed adding school zones to the list of areas where holding a phone while driving is prohibited, which is more limited than HB 874’s proposal. SB 932 failed to advance from a House subcommittee on Monday.</p>
<p>Richmond Police Chief Will Smith said during a press conference in January that his department supports HB 874 and that anyone with children shouldn’t be surprised by the proposal.</p>
<p>“One of the very first things that we all talk about with our kids is, ‘Make sure that you leave your phone out of your hand and don’t text, don’t call until you get to your destination,’” Smith said. “Yet we, as an adult society, tend not to obey our own advice.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless Virginians remember biting into the custardy sweetness of a pawpaw, the peculiar combination of mango and banana filling their mouths as the drops of juice dribbled down their chins, the perfect treat for a sweltering late August afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These memories might be honored with state recognition, but not until at least 2021, after a House bill was recently continued to next session. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB592" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 592</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, would have honored pawpaws as the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/pawpaws-may-become-virginias-official-state-fruit-whats-behind-their-rise-in-popularity/" target="_blank">official state fruit</a>. The measure was proposed after a local scout troop noticed Virginia is without state fruit representation. Ashley Jacobs, assistant leader of the 53rd Barred Owls of Gainesville, said the scouts noticed the discrepancy during a hike. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The scouts went through and tried to name all the state symbols, like the cardinal and the dogwood flower,” Jacobs said. “But nobody could come up with the state fruit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacobs said the scouts immediately began to brainstorm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This particular trail we were hiking on always has pawpaws,” she said. “We tried the pawpaws and were talking, and we all agreed it should be the state fruit since it is native here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacobs emailed Guzman, who instructed her team to draft the legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pawpaws grow in densely wooded areas of Virginia, but are not generally farmed commercially because they have a short shelf life. A pawpaw lasts for about </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/pawpaws-may-become-virginias-official-state-fruit-whats-behind-their-rise-in-popularity/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three days</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once ripe, which can make commercial farming and transportation difficult. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guzman said the pawpaw has an important role in Virginia history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a very popular fruit for Native Americans,” Guzman said. “I think it’s time that we embrace what is originally from here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said HB 592 will teach many Virginians about history, as well as local flora and fauna. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They will know there is a connection between Native Americans and the fruit,” Guzman said. “The fruit is currently celebrated in festivals in Virginia because it shows our history and our resources.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative co-sponsor Del. Ibraheem Samirah, D-Fairfax, agreed the bill is one of the lighter topics the General Assembly has tackled this session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s a nice, fun bill that adds a little flavor to state politics,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samirah also said the impacts could be far-reaching. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s shifting focus back to the agricultural nature of Virginia,” he said. “Our number one export is agriculture; we take it seriously and we’re always trying to further it in one way or another.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samirah hopes the legislation brings attention to farmers and pawpaws. Virginia is well represented by numerous other state symbols. The American foxhound takes the title of state dog, the tiger swallowtail butterfly is the state insect and the Northern cardinal is honored as the state bird. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jacobs said the bill has taught the scouts a lot about government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were interested in helping our scouts get a better grasp of how their government works,” she said. “Most of them are young. There’s a lot of surprise, like how can this one question go so far?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, Virginia will have to wait until at least next year to have an official fruit. A subcommittee continued the bill to 2021 by voice vote Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;If there are any other contenders for state fruit that emerge in the interim we will give them equal consideration,” said Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, at the meeting. “I hear there&#8217;s a big interest in persimmon.&#8221;</span></p>

Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, would allow immigrants to obtain a driver’s license regardless of legal status.

Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, is an identical bill that also extends these rights to undocumented immigrants. Tran introduced a similar bill that died in subcommittee last year. If approved, the bills will go into effect Jan. 1, 2021.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nayeli Montes said she came to the United States illegally from Mexico in 2005 for a chance at a better life. She worked 12-hour shifts at a restaurant back home earning the equivalent of $6.50 a day. Today, Montes is involved with the <a href="https://www.fauquier.com/news/lawmakers-promise-to-fight-hard-for-immigrant-rights/article_9311ea08-3a47-11ea-b5ce-23948f2143ec.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fauquier.com/news/lawmakers-promise-to-fight-hard-for-immigrant-rights/article_9311ea08-3a47-11ea-b5ce-23948f2143ec.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581033369713000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFw7R5CNwe6L2I0WLo9nqL0VViTdg">Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights</a>, which lobbies lawmakers for immigrant rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Driver’s licenses can be required to obtain items like credit cards and car insurance. Currently, 13 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico provide driver’s licenses for undocumented immigrants. VACIR believes providing driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants will make roads safer because drivers will be educated, trained and tested. The three states that adopted these measures the earliest experienced a 30% decrease in traffic fatalities, compared to a nationwide 20 percent drop, according to The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, which studies issues affecting low-income residents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The coalition said the bill will increase state revenue through vehicle registration, license plate fees and title fees. According to The Commonwealth Institute, allowing undocumented immigrants to drive would produce between $11 million and $18 million in revenue from car registration fees, title fees and license plate fees. The institute estimated that between 124,500 and 160,800 drivers would seek Virginia licenses within the first two years if immigration status was not a factor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Humberto Rodriguez, the owner of a painting company and an immigrant from Mexico, said he came to the U.S. for better opportunities for him and his family. He said his son is the only person in his household who can legally drive and he would like for this privilege to be extended to all immigrants. His son is a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipient. DACA allows undocumented children who entered the U.S. before they turned 16 to work, attend college or university and obtain a driver’s license.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I just want to make it clear that we came here to make a living for ourselves,” Rodriguez said. “Undocumented immigrants will go out and work no matter the weather conditions and we do our work with dignity.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The House bill has received more support this year than last year, but one representative worries it may misrepresent an immigrant’s legal status.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Del. Terry L. Austin, R-Botetourt, said he voted against the House bill because the driver’s license that would be issued to an undocumented immigrant is identical to a citizen’s driver’s license and could misrepresent the legal status of an immigrant.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think we need to be very careful with this,” Austin said. “This could misrepresent an individual’s identity and could compromise the safety in the United States.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Undocumented immigrants also have concerns. They worry the DMV could potentially release their information to the federal government and that they could get arrested or deported. However, both bills state that an individual’s name won’t be released unless ordered by a court. Additionally no photograph would be released to law enforcement or federal authorities unless a name or sufficient evidence was presented; the commissioner could still decline to release the photograph.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tran also sponsored <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201%2Bsum%2BHB1700&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581033369713000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGKClQSEdP30ncZGKITaHI51tcORw">HB 1700</a> which limits the release of information such as proof documents, photographs of an individual and signatures from the DMV to government agencies. Additionally, the bill would prohibit a federal immigration law enforcement agency from accessing information stored by the DMV without a court order or warrant. A subcommittee shelved that bill Tuesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The fate of <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201%2Bsum%2BHB1211&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1581033369713000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuvKX3iCpuX_xn6utgbxTxxQHSGA">HB 1211</a> hasn’t been determined. The bill has been shuffled among House panels, with two recommendations, and is currently in an Appropriations subcommittee that meets next week.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><u><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1103" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D201%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3DHB1103&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1580346041698000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG_8OkoWqnFPG4KImzQG-sWUzSMHg" target="_blank">House Bill 1103,</a></u> introduced by Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville, would open a pilot program for ranked-choice voting in local elections, such as city council or school board contests.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"> “Rank choice voting is a small change to ballots that makes a big difference for democracy,” Hudson said. “In a ranked-choice election, you don&#8217;t just vote for one candidate, you get to rank them from most to least favorite.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Hudson, <u><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wyPSa-O0bHnQtqyB8s9OzXY8_EuLILURc0Vcvc_3ZJM/edit?usp=sharing" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wyPSa-O0bHnQtqyB8s9OzXY8_EuLILURc0Vcvc_3ZJM/edit?usp%3Dsharing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1580346041698000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZTTMdTBmg_DGtn7uitDKrSOIWow" target="_blank">after the votes are ranked, they are counted in a process similar to a traditional election.</a></u> If one candidate wins more than half of the first choice votes, they win the election. If no candidate emerges as the majority winner in the first round, the lowest ranked candidate is eliminated and the losing candidate’s votes are transferred to the voters’ second choice. The elimination process continues until a candidate earns more than half of the votes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hudson said diverse groups of people want to run for office, but that can sometimes lead to overcrowding in elections and a winning candidate who does not have much support, but who was able to eke out a win. She thinks the bill is the answer to that problem.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It makes sure that we can have a leader who represents a broad swath of the community, no matter how many candidates run,” Hudson said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ranked-choice voting is not new, at least<u><a href="https://www.fairvote.org/rcv#where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fairvote.org/rcv%23where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1580346041698000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGPPZ1czYmsPbU0ceVKeae_HNZL_Q" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.fairvote.org/rcv#where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fairvote.org/rcv%23where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1580346041698000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGPPZ1czYmsPbU0ceVKeae_HNZL_Q" target="_blank">20 cities in the United States have adopted it</a></u>. In 2018, Maine began using it for federal elections. Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, is the chief co-patron for the bill.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We have found that in other places where this is practiced, it leads to more positive campaigns,” Hope said. “It means that candidates are working, so if they can&#8217;t be a voters’ first choice, they can be their second choice and not the negative campaigning that we&#8217;ve seen lately.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Localities opt to use the voting method, and according to Hope, it would be up to them to fund it as well.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;ve worked that out, the locality will bear the cost, not the state,” he said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While Hope does not believe ranked-choice voting will happen at a state level, he said Arlington residents are excited about this measure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"> “I know that there&#8217;s also a bill floating around to do this statewide,” Hope said. “I thought if the rest of the state is not ready for that, I know Arlington certainly is.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Glenn Davis, R-Virginia Beach, is a Republican co-patron for HB 1103. He said he supports the legislation because it gives localities more freedom to govern.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"> “I always believe that localities should have the option to run elections the way that they think are most efficient, and create the most involvement from the voters,” Davis said. “A lot of studies have shown that voters are more involved when there&#8217;s more opportunity for the candidates, when there&#8217;s a ranked election system.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“So if there are localities out there that would like to try it in Virginia, they should be allowed to give it a shot,” he added.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Davis said that legislation had worked well in other districts and he signed on to encourage voter participation and make the electoral process better.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I think any way that we can run elections that provide more information, more access to voters in manners that get them more engaged, the better off our our democratic process is,” he said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1103 reported out of <u><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+vot+H1802V0006+HB1103" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201%2Bvot%2BH1802V0006%2BHB1103&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1580346041698000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXOdjlBkZ5BeoPsX7o7FsGrx5Vtg" target="_blank">subcommittee</a></u>, 4-3.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the Virginia Department of Transportation and the Department of Motor Vehicles, 123 pedestrians died on the state’s roads in 2018 — the highest death toll in 10 years. 2019 also has been deadly: As of mid-December, 112 pedestrians have been killed in traffic accidents in the commonwealth.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Not only are more pedestrians being killed, but they also are making up a greater proportion of all traffic fatalities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, 10% of the people killed in roadway accidents in Virginia were pedestrians.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">That figure jumped to 16% the following year. Last year, it was 15%, according to VDOT and DMV data.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The vast, overwhelming majority of people who die on our streets are killed by drivers of cars,” noted Ross Catrow, executive director of RVA Rapid Transit, an advocacy group for regional public transportation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“And the further sad truth is that these deaths and serious injuries often go unnoticed, underreported, and, even worse, usually nothing is done to build better streets and make them safer for people,” Catrow wrote on <u><a href="https://streetscred.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://streetscred.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1576700785255000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEahvAHq_7ikqo6bqFdKCL_S8bWiA" target="_blank">Streets Cred</a></u>, his website about urban issues affecting mid-sized American cities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Catrow has pointed out that some people say pedestrians are at fault for the rising number of traffic accidents. He rejects that notion.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m so ultra-tired of engineers, elected officials and everyone else blaming ‘distracted pedestrians’ for the increase in injuries on our roads,” <u><a href="https://gmrva.com/podcast/2019/11/22/good-morning-rva-themed-public-schools-drones-and-slowing-streets-with-paint-amp-posts" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://gmrva.com/podcast/2019/11/22/good-morning-rva-themed-public-schools-drones-and-slowing-streets-with-paint-amp-posts&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1576700785255000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHjNrwI3nNOajmQZGnL8GHeNXw1LA" target="_blank">he said</a></u> on his “Good Morning, RVA” podcast.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Catrow advocates traffic-calming measures such as painted curb bulbs and posts that can narrow intersections, increase visibility and slow down drivers to prevent pedestrian accidents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some people blame elderly drivers for causing accidents. But 25% of the motorists involved in traffic accidents that have killed pedestrians since 2013 were in their 20s — and half of them were under 40. About 22% of the drivers involved in pedestrian fatalities were 60 and older.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ralph Aronberg, a traffic engineer consultant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said some people in their early 20s have poor driving habits.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Drivers in that age group are more likely to use social media such as Instagram on their cellphone, are more likely to have groups in vehicles leading to distractions and are less likely to realize the consequences of taking their eyes off the road,” he said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Aronberg, whose firm focuses on accident reconstructions, said people in their early 20s are also more likely to drive at night, drink and drive, or be under the influence of THC or other mind-altering substances while operating a car.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pedestrians killed in traffic accidents in Virginia since 2013 have ranged in age from infants to 96. About a third of the victims were under 30; slightly over a third in their 40s and 50s; and the rest 60 or older.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2013, Fairfax has had the most pedestrian deaths — more than 80, according to VDOT data. Then come Henrico County (43), Norfolk (40), Richmond (31) and Newport News (27).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The roads with the most pedestrian fatalities during that time period were:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Jefferson Avenue, Newport News — seven</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Route 11, Washington County — three</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">South Street, Front Royal — three</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Southbound Route 288, Goochland County — three</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Chamberlayne Avenue, Richmond — three</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Weather was not a factor in most pedestrian deaths.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Most vehicle-pedestrian accidents happen in good weather,” said Daniel Vomhof, a traffic safety expert in California and a member of the Accreditation Commission for Traffic Accident Reconstructionists.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">More than 85% of the pedestrian fatalities in Virginia happened in clear or cloudy weather conditions, the VDOT data showed. About 13% occurred in rain, mist or fog, and 1% in snowy weather.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To stay safe, Vomhof recommends that pedestrians wear white or reflective shoes at night and light-colored clothing that doesn’t blend in with the surroundings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Visibility increases when the object is in eye contrast to the background,” Vomhof said.</p>

<p>Martin Wegbreit has known for a long time that Richmond has a problem with evictions, but a 2018 New York Times article brought national attention to the issue. It said the city’s eviction rate was more than 11% — three to four times the national average.</p>
<p>“The only thing that really surprises me about evictions in Richmond is how surprised everybody else is,” said Wegbreit, the director of litigation at the Central Virginia Legal Aid Society.</p>
<p>Since the article came out, city and state officials started allocating more resources to the problem, and those strategies appear to be working: Through September of this year, the number of evictions has dropped about 19% in Richmond and 14% across Virginia, according to an analysis of court data.</p>
<p>From Jan. 1 through Sept. 30, about 10,600 eviction cases were filed in General District Court in Richmond. That compares with more than 13,000 cases during the corresponding period of 2018.</p>
<h2><strong>Eviction by the numbers</strong></h2>
<p>Statewide, about 155,000 evictions were filed in 2018. About 125,000 of those cases were filed during the first nine months of the year. During the first nine months of 2019, about 108,000 evictions were filed statewide.</p>
<p>Richmond’s evictions accounted for about 10% of the statewide total — more than any other city or county. Through September, Newport News had about 9,500 evictions; Norfolk, approximately 8,800; and Virginia Beach, more than 8,400.</p>
<figure id="attachment_13690" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:280px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evictions_BAR_GRAPH.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-13690 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evictions_BAR_GRAPH-280x300.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evictions_BAR_GRAPH-280x300.jpg 280w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evictions_BAR_GRAPH-768x822.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evictions_BAR_GRAPH-696x745.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evictions_BAR_GRAPH-392x420.jpg 392w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/evictions_BAR_GRAPH.jpg 953w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (Graphics by Patricia Cason and Jaclyn Barton of VCU Capital News Service )</p></figure>
<p>Much of the concern about evictions in Richmond has focused on the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority, which provides public housing for low-income families including housing complexes like Creighton, Fairfield, Gilpin, Hillside, Mosby and Whitcomb courts.</p>
<p>During 2018, the RRHA accounted for almost 2,200 evictions. Through September of this year, the RRHA had filed about 1,500 evictions — 15% fewer than the agency took to court during the same period of 2018.</p>
<p>In November, RRHA implemented an agency-wide freeze on lease enforcement for nonpayment of rent. As a result, “no public housing family will be removed from their home for debt owed to RRHA.”</p>
<h2><strong>The eviction process</strong></h2>
<p>Tough eviction laws in Virginia contribute to the state’s high eviction rate, according to tenant advocates. For example, if tenants miss a rent payment in Virginia, they can be told to provide the money within five days. In other states, notices can be up to 30 days.</p>
<p>Wegbreit said Virginia’s eviction laws are too harsh. “To be honest, I think they are less favorable [and] less friendly to tenants,” he said.</p>
<p>Wegbreit says part of the problem is the archaic legal terminology surrounding evictions. Many tenants receive eviction notices they struggle to understand. For example, “unlawful detainer” is the official legal term for eviction in the state.</p>
<p>“When you have an unlawful detainer, that is when the court finds you guilty of not paying your rent, and that&#8217;s when the official eviction ends up on the record,” said Amelie Rives, a graduate student who works with the RVA Eviction Lab at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>
<p>Rives said tenants are given a five-day notice to “pay or quit” after the payment grace period.</p>
<p>“Most people actually pay within the five to 10 days once they get the ‘pay or quit,’” Rives said. “And the reason why it&#8217;s so hard to track the numbers for eviction is a lot of this happens outside of the court system.”</p>
<p>After the five-day notice, the landlord can file a formal eviction against the tenant. A court date is set, and the tenant must attend even if the rent owed has been paid.</p>
<p>At the court date, a writ of possession is issued if the tenant is found guilty of “unlawful detainer,” or not paying rent. This writ is what allows the sheriff to evict a tenant. The tenants have 10 to 15 days to leave, or the sheriff will come remove them.</p>
<p>Sheriff evictions account for 30% of involuntary moves. Rives said this is the only number that can easily be tracked, despite the fact that it’s less than a third of total evictions.</p>
<p>Since evictions stay on a tenant’s record for about seven years, tenants are left with fewer housing options after an eviction.</p>
<p>“It really ties people to their location in a way that can and cannot be helpful depending on what life circumstances they’re in,” Rives said.</p>
<h2><strong>Challenges in finding resources</strong></h2>
<p>Rives says it’s difficult for people going through eviction to find assistance.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s a mix of not having enough bandwidth and that scarcity of ability to think about anything else. If you&#8217;re going through eviction, there is probably a lot more going on, but you&#8217;ve got to focus on that one thing,” Rives said.</p>
<p>Moreover, she said, “There&#8217;s not necessarily a streamlined place that someone could go and qualify for assistance, especially if that person is not extremely low-income or they don&#8217;t have children.”</p>
<p>Poverty is a cause of eviction in Richmond. The city’s poverty rate is 22%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2018 American Community Survey.</p>
<p>Arlington and Fairfax counties have programs called “coordinated or centralized access” to assist tenants facing evictions. These programs provide one-stop shopping for helpful resources. Both counties’ poverty rates are lower than Richmond’s.</p>
<p>Although Richmond does have resources such as the <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2019/03/14/virginia-create-pilot-program-reduce-eviction-rates/" target="_blank">Evictions Diversion Pilot Program</a>, most tenants aren’t aware of where they can go for help, tenant advocates say. As a result, and because they may feel helpless during the eviction process, many tenants do not show up for their court dates, Rives said.</p>
<h2><strong>A task force to address the issue</strong></h2>
<p>Wegbreit is a co-facilitator of the Evictions Task Force, which Richmond created to address the eviction crisis.</p>
<p>The idea came after two law students from Yale and Stanford University conducted research about evictions in Richmond for seven months. They wrote a report of recommendations on how to address the problem.</p>
<figure id="attachment_604" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EvictionandPoverty2crop-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-604" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EvictionandPoverty2crop-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1255" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EvictionandPoverty2crop-1.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EvictionandPoverty2crop-1-300x196.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EvictionandPoverty2crop-1-768x502.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EvictionandPoverty2crop-1-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EvictionandPoverty2crop-1-696x455.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EvictionandPoverty2crop-1-1068x698.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/EvictionandPoverty2crop-1-643x420.jpg 643w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map of Richmond created by Benjamin Teresa shows overlap between areas with high eviction rates (marked with lines) and areas with high concentrations of poverty (marked in red and pink). (Virginia Mercury file)</p></figure>
<p>The Evictions Task Force is a group of stakeholders that includes public housing residents, tenant advocates, nonprofit executives, civil rights lawyers, homelessness specialists and academics.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m one of those people who believes you can&#8217;t really see results unless you have a nice mix of diversity and opinion,” Rives said of the task force. “So when you have that nice diversity of opinion in such a public way, I think that you can see results.”</p>
<p>The task force will focus on six primary areas: prevention, landlord and tenant education, individuals who are at or below 30% of area median income, tenant support, centralized supportive services and affordable housing.</p>
<p>“I think the goal for this task force is to prioritize what are the things that we can do sooner rather than later,” Mayor Levar Stoney said at the Evictions Task Force meeting on Dec. 2. “Let us, let the politicians, worry about the cost. You guys find the solutions, and then if you guys find great solutions, the politicians will find the will to find the dollars.”</p>
<p><em><strong>About the data in this report: </strong>For this story, multimedia journalists Patricia Cason and Jaclyn Barton analyzed data on evictions cases filed in General District Court throughout Virginia. The data had been scraped from the state’s court system by Ben Schoenfeld, a software engineer in Hampton Roads, and posted on an open website. Evictions cases, officially called “unlawful detainers,” are civil filings. So the reporters downloaded records on all civil cases filed in General District Court statewide in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (through September). From the 2.8 million records, the reporters extracted the eviction cases — more than 620,000. They used Microsoft Access and Excel to look at the number of evictions by year and by locality. The reporters also examined the number of cases filed by the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority.</em></p>

(On Monday,<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/buttigieg-is-first-democratic-presidential-candidate-to-file-for-virginia/article_377229ba-3241-55e1-9738-0abeedb0dfa8.html" target="_blank"> Buttigieg became the first presidential candidate</a> to file for the Democratic primary in Virginia, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“He is doing generally — at the broad level — a very good job of raising money, you know. That may pay better dividends in states like Iowa,” Coleman said. He said he expects Biden to prevail in “most of the state, especially in the urban areas.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In September, a statewide poll by the University of Mary Washington <u><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/2019/09/27/biden-leads-democratic-nomination-in-virginia-umw-survey-finds/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.umw.edu/news/2019/09/27/biden-leads-democratic-nomination-in-virginia-umw-survey-finds/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1574204598239000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF9MfL_4KGrfm9NEUVnDF_Z1OH1QQ" target="_blank">found</a></u> that 23% of Virginia’s registered voters favored Biden. Warren and Sanders each had the support of 9% of voters. Then came U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris of California at 5% and Buttigieg at 4%.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>High-Profile Donors</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Buttigieg’s campaign gained the support of several high-profile Virginia Democrats. Albert Gore, an executive at Tesla and son of former Vice President Al Gore, gave $5,800 to Buttigieg. Albert Gore’s wife, Brittany, a researcher at Georgetown University, contributed $5,600. U.S. Rep. Don Beyer of Arlington also donated $5,600.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last spring, Megan Beyer, a consultant and journalist who is married to the congressman, gave $2,800 to Biden and $1,000 to U.S. Sen. Kristen Gillibrand of New York, who has since dropped out of the presidential race. But in September, Megan Beyer donated $5,600 to Buttigieg as well.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Biden also has attracted noteworthy donations. Internet pioneer Vint Cerf, a vice president of Google, has given $4,700 to Biden and $5,500 to Gillibrand. Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and former first lady Dorothy McAuliffe each gave $3,800 to Biden and $500 to Amy Klobuchar, a U.S. senator from Minnesota.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Former FBI Director James Comey of McLean, Virginia, gave Klobuchar $2,700. His wife, Patrice Failor Comey, gave $2,810 to Klobuchar, $2,700 to Harris and $1,100 to Warren.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Other notable donors include Dick Patrick, president of the Washington Capitals professional hockey team. He gave $1,000 to John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman who is considered a longshot for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Boyd Tinsley, a founding member of the Dave Matthews Band, contributed $2,800 to former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who ended his presidential bid earlier this month. Stefan Lessard, the band’s bassist, gave Harris $1,050.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sanders has received the most individual donations from Virginia — more than 8,400. Buttigieg and Warren each have drawn more than 5,000 contributions, and Biden, about 3,100.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump, the presumed Republican nominee for re-election, has received more individual contributions than any of the Democrats since 2018: more than 20,000 donations totaling over $1.1 million.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Reluctant to Discuss Politics</strong></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Politics and money remain taboo subjects for many people. Asked what guided their decision to donate to a candidate, several contributors declined to comment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gerald Saunders, an instructor in the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Business, has given Trump 25 donations totaling $1,107. “I’m not wanting to be ‘political’ other than supporting our president and don’t want to be interviewed about it,” he said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Clifford Mumm, a former executive with the Bechtel engineering and construction firm who oversaw infrastructure repairs in Iraq after 9/11, has given to the most presidential candidates: $2,700 to Klobuchar, $2,700 to Biden, $2,800 to O’Rourke, $2,800 to Buttigieg and $4,300 to Marianne Williamson, an author and activist. His wife, Christine, also gave $500 to Williamson and $2,800 to Buttigieg.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“To be honest, I am not very interested in being interviewed. The contributions made by my wife and I were a financial stretch but intended to help get opposition candidates moving,” Clifford Mumm said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We chose candidates we thought could possibly succeed. Things have deteriorated further, and at this point, any candidate, right or left, who offers some semblance of stability and decency would be better than the current president.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>With contributions from other data journalism students at Virginia Commonwealth University.</em></p>
<p><strong>CORRECTION:</strong> <em>This article has been updated to correct an error. Former Vice President Al Gore&#8217;s son Albert Gore donated to Pete Buttigieg’s campaign. The spelling of Gerald Saunders&#8217; name has also been corrected.</em></p>

</p><p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>By Eric Everington/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia recycled almost half of its trash last year, setting a record despite China’s ban on importing plastic and other solid waste.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The statewide recycling rate in 2018 was 46% — up 3 percentage points from the previous year, according to data released this week by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. The data showed that:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The Central Virginia Waste Management Authority, which includes Richmond and surrounding localities, had the highest recycling rate in the commonwealth — 59%.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Peninsulas Public Service Authority, which includes Hampton, Poquoson and Williamsburg and nearby counties, had the lowest rate — 29%.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Newport News had the biggest improvement in recycling in recent years. Its rate jumped from 38% in 2016 to 57% last year.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers represent the percentage of municipal solid waste that is sent for recycling. Local governments also get credit for activities such as programs to reduce the amount of trash generated.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Several factors affect an area’s recycling rate. They include population, population density, location of recycling facilities and funding.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By April 30 each year, the local governments and regional planning units that oversee recycling collect their data and submit a report to the Department of Environmental Quality. DEQ reviews the information and then calculates an overall recycling rate for the state.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“DEQ works with businesses and localities and environmental groups to promote environmental awareness through recycling,” said Leslie Beckwith, the agency’s director of financial responsibility and waste management programs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The statewide recycling rate was 44% in 2015. It dropped to 43% in 2016 and 2017 before jumping to 46% last year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The increase came despite an unstable market for various types of trash to be recycled — especially China’s decision to stop accepting solid waste.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“China’s revisions in recycling material acceptance is having a big impact on the recycling market,” Beckwith said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, DEQ has asked localities and planning units to identify any changes or challenges regarding their recycling efforts when they submit their 2019 reports.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One change is that many localities have dropped recycling glass because it is hard to find a market for that product. That is why DEQ is asking Virginians to minimize their use of glass.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Citizens should try to generate less waste, like purchasing products with the least amount of packaging and those that are readily recyclable, such as aluminum cans vs. glass bottles,” said Anissa Rafeh, the department’s communications coordinator.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Glass can be problematic to recycle for several reasons, said Joe Romuno, director of national accounts for an environmental consulting firm called Great Forest Sustainability Solutions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Broken glass can contaminate other recyclables like paper and cardboard, lowering their value,” Romuno said. Moreover, broken glass can be a safety hazard to workers and can damage machines at recycling facilities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Also, glass must be sorted by color in order to reprocess for recycling. “Glass is difficult to sort when broken, and if broken down too finely, it may become too difficult to reprocess,” Romuno said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Four localities in Northern Virginia have teamed up to tackle the challenge of glass recycling.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Alexandria and the counties of Fairfax, Arlington Prince William have joined forces to collect source-separated glass in purple bins for better recovery. The glass is then crushed at Fairfax County’s Glass Processing Center to produce sand and gravel that can be used in construction and landscaping projects.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ is also keeping an eye on new technologies to improve Virginia’s recycling efforts. For example, the agency was on hand when the Central Virginia Waste Management Authority announced it was deploying 2,000 recycling bins from an Israeli company called UBQ.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The bins are made with a thermoplastic created from household waste that would normally end up in a landfill, including banana peels, chicken bones, plastics and old pizza boxes.</p>

Joe Morrissey appears to have won election to the Virginia Senate Tuesday. (NBC12)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Jimmy O’Keefe/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">“Fighting Joe” is back.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Joe Morrissey, a controversial figure in Virginia politics, appears poised to return to the legislature after defeating independent candidate Waylin Ross in Senate District 16 with nearly two-thirds of the vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Having been there before, having seen the way things work, I really, truly am going in with a slightly different approach this time,” Morrissey said in an interview Monday, anticipating his win. He noted that his constituents will be his primary concern. As of Tuesday night, <a href="https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2019%20November%20General/Site/GeneralAssembly.html" target="_blank">Morrissey had more than 65% of the vote</a>, with almost all precincts reporting.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Morrissey won his party’s nomination in June, defeating incumbent Sen. Rosalyn Dance in a primary election with 56% of the votes. Dance had held the seat — which includes Petersburg and Hopewell, part of Richmond and parts of Chesterfield, Prince George, and Dinwiddie counties — since 2014.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Morrissey has previously served in the General Assembly, representing House District 74 between 2008 and 2015. During that time, he was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor for having a relationship with a 17-year-old receptionist, now his wife. Morrissey has been disbarred twice and earned the moniker “Fighting Joe” after punching a defense lawyer in 1991 while serving as Richmond’s commonwealth attorney.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Morrissey said he has legislative plans for his return to Capitol Square.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m introducing three pieces of legislation right away,” Morrissey said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The legislation includes a bill to re-establish parole in Virginia (parole for felons convicted and given a life sentence was abolished in 1995), a bill to double the number of Virginia’s drug courts and a bill to establish a mental health court in the state.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The interests that I represent are Virginians’, and the residents of the 16th Senate District come first. Party comes second.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">During the primary between Morrissey and Dance, many Democrats, including Gov. Ralph Northam, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, endorsed Dance. Morrissey’s win over Dance prompted concerns within the Democratic party that Morrissey would not be a reliable vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These concerns seem to have evaporated as Morrissey touts an agenda largely in-step with the Democratic party line. His relationships with major state Democratic figures have improved too — last month, McAuliffe and Senate Minority Leader Dick Saslaw hosted a fundraiser for Morrissey at his Richmond home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the same day, Northam’s The Way Ahead PAC donated $5,000 to Morrissey’s campaign.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Morrissey’s campaign focused primarily on visiting and speaking to civic associations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We are staying pretty busy during the weekends, visiting churches and bigger festivals that are going on,” Morrissey said Monday. “There’s been no letting up off the gas pedal.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Morrissey said he looks forward to returning to the General Assembly despite the controversies that caused him to leave it in the first place.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Since I was 13, I learned that you never give up, you never quit. There’s always going to be trials and tribulations, but you get up and you move forward. That’s what I do all the time.”</p>

</p><p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>By Hannah Eason/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">You might call it the Facebook Election.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many voters are “cutting the cord” from cable TV, and candidates and political organizations are turning to Facebook to attract Virginia voters in Tuesday’s legislative and local elections.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Between July 1 and Oct. 25, Facebook users in Virginia were bombarded with about $6 million in political advertising, according to the social media company.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization that seeks to restrict access to firearms and curb gun violence, has spent the most — about $215,000 — on Facebook ads. The group, largely financed by New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg, announced Friday that it has spent $2.5 million in the Virginia election, including $770,000 in digital advertising.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">People’s Power Grab, which advocates for voter registration and mobilization, bought about $208,000 in advertising on Facebook. The Dogwood, a Virginia digital media outlet, was third at more than $170,000.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is no surprise why advocacy groups and politicians are turning to Facebook. It’s the most popular social media platform and can deliver ads targeted to users based on gender, age and other demographics — at a cost much less than television.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Washington State University professor Travis Ridout says Facebook’s ability to reach a majority of Americans makes it attractive to political campaigns.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Facebook also allows [a] campaign many different ways to target voters, making it an efficient way to reach desired audiences,” said Ridout, who teaches government and public policy.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Judi Crenshaw, public relations instructor at Virginia Commonwealth University, says Facebook’s low cost and micro-targeting makes it appealing to campaigns with a limited staff and budget.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very, very efficient because you actually don’t have to waste time and money on people who will already vote for your candidate. You don’t have to waste time or money on people who will never vote for your candidate,” Crenshaw said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“You can zero right in on the people who can be swayed either way. In terms of convincing them, there’s a whole path you can go down in terms of deciding if keeping people at home, or turning people out who will benefit your candidate.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook has posted data about advertising purchases in its <u><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1573002699725000&amp;usg=AFQjCNExiXhN3WNDMMWTcPmi4eQs56rlhQ" target="_blank">Ad Library</a></u>. The data show that over a recent 90-day period, about 1,860 candidates and groups spent $5.5 million on Facebook ads in Virginia. An additional 11,000 ad buys targeting Virginians were for $100 or less; for those small purchases, Facebook does not disclose the exact amount.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Less was spent on Facebook ads in Virginia’s bordering states. For example, Maryland had about $2.1 million in Facebook ad purchases.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The state with the most money spent on political advertising was California with $17,243,441.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">President Donald Trump’s Facebook spending was compiled from two committees: The Trump Make America Great Again Committee spent about $104,000 targeting Virginians on Facebook, and Donald J. Trump for President Inc. spent $23,771.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Other top spenders include Democratic presidential candidates Tom Steyer at around $134,000 in Facebook ads, Pete Buttigieg at $93,000 and Elizabeth Warren at $45,000.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Candidates for the Virginia House and Senate have also had their share of Facebook advertising.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Del. Nick Freitas spent the most since July 1 — more than $43,000. Freitas currently represents House District 30, which includes Madison and Orange counties and part of Culpeper County. He is running as a write-in candidate after he filed incomplete paperwork to appear on the ballot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, a Democrat, is running in Senate District 8 in Hampton Roads. Cotter Smasal spent around $38,000 on Facebook ads. The incumbent, Republican Sen. Bill DeSteph, bought less than $2,000 in Facebook ads.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Tim Hugo was also high in Facebook spending at more than $36,000. The incumbent has served in House District 40 — which covers parts of Fairfax and Prince William counties — since 2003. Since Oct. 25, Hugo bought about $18,000 more in Facebook ads, and his Democratic challenger, Dan Helmer, spent about $28,000 on Facebook.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Del. Cheryl Turpin is running for the Senate District 7, which covers most of Virginia Beach and part of Norfolk. She spent around $34,000 on Facebook ads between July 1 and Oct. 25.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In Senate District 12 in the Richmond area, Republican Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant spent about $31,000 on Facebook ads during that time frame and another $10,000 since then. Her opponent, Democratic Del. Debra Rodman, has bought about $18,000 in Facebook ads since July 1.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">October brought more donations to candidates and more knocks on constituent doors from both sides of the gun lobby.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic coffers &#8212; which have reached historic levels of reported fundraising — swelled with October donations from Everytown for Gun Safety, a lobby group focused on reducing gun violence. Everytown contributed $938,238 to the Democratic party in 2019 according to <a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/229503-everytown-for-gun-safety/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/donors/229503-everytown-for-gun-safety/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1572555524539000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBIbysg6-9maLV6P-ZOU7w_TKbYA" target="_blank">The Virginia Public Access Project</a>. Over $600,000 of that total was given in September.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Everytown outspent the National Rifle Association this year, which donated $273,000 to Republican candidates. In September, based on campaign finance reports, the NRA donated a little over $54,000.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The politics of guns in Virginia has changed dramatically over the last few years,” said Stephen Farnsworth, professor of political science and director of the University of Mary Washington&#8217;s Center for Leadership and Media Studies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Everytown received a <a href="https://everytown.org/documents/2019/08/2019-va-general-assembly-polling.pdf/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://everytown.org/documents/2019/08/2019-va-general-assembly-polling.pdf/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1572555524539000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGB8poIy-ml5iJXE2xvUmD284dgAQ" target="_blank">study</a> in late August about voter concerns that was conducted and published by Schoen Consulting. The firm interviewed 1,247 voters in swing districts across three regions of the state. Candidates’ positions on gun control was important for voters, according to the study. In Northern Virginia, 82% of voters prioritized a candidate’s stance on gun issues as important. In Richmond suburbs, 87% of voters found it important, and in the Hampton Roads area 83% of voters found it important. The study also concluded that Republican opposition to red flag laws — laws to remove guns from some people considered a risk to themselves or others — was the most convincing reason across all three regions to vote against Republicans in the November General Assembly elections, when respondents were given choices that included health care, education, the environment, guns and taxes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Everytown, according to communication associate Mariah McGough, pledged to spend $2.5 million in this year’s state elections. The lobby group also endorsed <a href="https://everytown.org/press/everytown-for-gun-safety-action-fund-endorses-25-candidates-in-virginias-2019-elections-donates-438000-to-endorsed-candidates-and-political-committees-working-to-elect-gun-sense-majority/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://everytown.org/press/everytown-for-gun-safety-action-fund-endorses-25-candidates-in-virginias-2019-elections-donates-438000-to-endorsed-candidates-and-political-committees-working-to-elect-gun-sense-majority/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1572555524539000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE728i0lLObX1yJNfnq7CFuAxISyg" target="_blank">25 candidates</a> and contributed to media and digital ad campaigns. A <a href="https://everytown.org/press/everytown-for-gun-safety-action-fund-launches-550000-digital-ad-offensive-in-15-republican-held-virginia-house-and-senate-districts/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://everytown.org/press/everytown-for-gun-safety-action-fund-launches-550000-digital-ad-offensive-in-15-republican-held-virginia-house-and-senate-districts/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1572555524539000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqCfVByZutCXpRzrAtggqwpfKstQ" target="_blank">$550,000 digital ad offensive</a> launched in 15 Republican-held House and Senate districts.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Everytown, according to VPAP, has given the most to Missy Cotter Smasal ($160,675) who is vying for the Senate District 8 seat held by incumbent Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach. Sheila Bynum-Coleman, running against incumbent Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, for House District 66 seat, received $126,000.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Democrats are much more willing to emphasize gun control in their campaign, and gun control money has become increasingly visible in Virginia politics,” Farnsworth said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Everytown has injected cash support for Democrats, but Moms Demand Action, a grassroots organization working to end gun violence, has been drumming up constituent support in neighborhoods. Heather Foglio, Moms Demand Action volunteer, said her group has been knocking on doors since July. She said the biggest concern is “lax gun laws in Virginia.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not anti-Second Amendment, we’re not anti-gun, we support the Second Amendment and believe it can go hand-in-hand with public safety and strong gun laws,” Foglio said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"> The NRA also has been busy. The bulk of its donations ($201,500) went to the political action committee of House Majority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah. The next largest contributions by the NRA were $25,000 each to Senate District 4 incumbent Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, and Senate District 26 incumbent Mark Obenshain, R-Rockingham.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In early August, top NRA leadership <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/three-nra-board-members-resign-in-latest-sign-of-upheaval-at-gun-rights-group/2019/08/01/aad49bc0-b49d-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/three-nra-board-members-resign-in-latest-sign-of-upheaval-at-gun-rights-group/2019/08/01/aad49bc0-b49d-11e9-8f6c-7828e68cb15f_story.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1572555524539000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtECaHnMb1dNXsaObEqBL1C-BH9w" target="_blank">resigned</a> after board members raised a concern about reports of reckless spending and mismanagement by the group’s leadership.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Perhaps part of the reason why we haven’t heard or seen more from the NRA in Virginia this election cycle has to do with the challenges the organization itself is facing at the moment,” Farnsworth said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The NRA has also been busy encouraging voter turnout this election. <a href="https://www.nraila.org/grassroots/second-amendment-activist-centers/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nraila.org/grassroots/second-amendment-activist-centers/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1572555524539000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFwLfFIraVhNySK8gaSu5HgnKQHdg" target="_blank">NRA grassroots</a> activists knocked on 100,000 doors of targeted voters in recent months, according to Catherine Mortensen, NRA media liaison. Also, the NRA rallied members at the State Capitol during the July special session that adjourned quickly with no action taken.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Linda Eastman, a volunteer for the NRA, said the organization is “not trying to force guns into people’s hands, we’re trying to protect their Second Amendment rights,” — a misconception she thinks people have about the NRA.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re all about gun safety not just gun violence and ‘everyone needs to have a gun,’ that’s not what the NRA is about,” Eastman said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Glen Caroline, head of the NRA’s Grassroots Programs and Campaign Field Operations Division, said he believes that engaged citizens can swing elections.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"> “I’ve been at this for nearly 30 years and I’ve seen time and again our voters swing key elections,” Caroline said. “I am aware of all the money our opponents are spending, but I’m not intimidated.</p>

</p><p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>By Eric Everington/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After a spike in deaths during the first half of the year, Virginia officials are projecting a record number of drug overdose fatalities in 2019.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><u><a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/medical-examiner/forensic-epidemiology/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/medical-examiner/forensic-epidemiology/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1572397158222000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUVqWXSotK2RuS552iSc4-dpsgeQ" target="_blank">Data</a></u> released Friday by Virginia’s chief medical examiner shows a big increase in deaths between January and June from overdoses of methamphetamine, heroin and fentanyl, a synthetic prescription painkiller.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner expects total drug fatalities in 2019 to approach <u><a href="http://bit.ly/overdose-deaths-charts" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/overdose-deaths-charts&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1572397158222000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGmXFxd64IDOiWMykX_-ck5eg9FlA" target="_blank">1,550</a></u> — a 4% jump from the previous year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Fentanyl, which is more lethal than heroin and cocaine, is often combined with street drugs. “By late 2013 and early 2014, some heroin being sold on the street was actually completely fentanyl unbeknownst to the user,” the office said in its latest quarterly report. “Fentanyl caused or contributed to death in nearly 55% of all fatal overdoses in 2018.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the first half of 2019, Fairfax County and the city of Richmond had the most drug deaths in the state — 49. Most of Richmond’s overdoses involved heroin and fentanyl, which is often produced overseas and trafficked into the U.S.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw drug overdoses and drug-related deaths really rise when we started to notice more and more fentanyl in toxicology reports in 2015,” said Capt. Emmett Williams of the Richmond Police Department. “The thing that is causing these overdoses is fentanyl being mixed with drugs like cocaine and heroin.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Just a pinch of fentanyl can be deadly, Williams said. “About 35% of seized drugs in Richmond have trace amounts of fentanyl mixed in with it,” he said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities say one of the main ways fentanyl enters the U.S. is by street dealers ordering the drug on the internet’s “dark web” and having it delivered through the mail.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re developing technology in package screening to detect fentanyl coming through the post office to combat the issue,” William said. “Fentanyl is also being shipped to Mexico and being trafficked across the border into the U.S. from there.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, only 50 drug overdose deaths in Virginia involved fentanyl. That number jumped to 624 in 2016, 770 in 2017 and 813 last year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Between Jan. 1 and June 30 of this year, the medical examiner said, 441 people died in Virginia from fentanyl overdoses. That compared with 371 such deaths during the first half of 2018.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The medical examiner projects that fentanyl will contribute to 883 deaths in the state in 2019.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Deaths involving heroin are expected to rise from 556 last year to 585 this year. And the medical examiner projects that fatalities involving methamphetamine will increase from 127 in 2018 to 152 this year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the number of drug overdose fatalities in the commonwealth has gone from 799 in 2012 to a record high of 1,536 in 2017. The death toll dropped slightly to 1,485 last year. With the recent upswing in drug overdose deaths, the medical examiner’s office projects Virginia will hit a new record of 1,547 in 2019.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kathrin Hobron, a forensic epidemiologist with the Virginia Department of Health, said a multifaceted approach is needed to address the problem.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Besides putting an emphasis on law enforcement, she said, there should be an emphasis on drug treatment. “Other than focusing on opioids or one drug, we should be focusing on the addiction of drugs and helping drug addicts get off drugs,” Hobron said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ballots must be returned by 7 p.m. on Election Day, or Nov. 5, in order to count. The only exception, according to Andrea Gaines, VDE director of community relations and compliance support, is if voters are overseas or in the military.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The return date is listed on the absentee ballot application, but not the ballot itself, according to Gaines.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There is no return date on the ballot itself,” she said. “When a voter receives an absentee ballot, they also receive instructions on how to properly cast that ballot in a manner in which it will be counted.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When asked how VDE worked with registrars to determine patterns preventing the timely return of ballots, per the 2018 report, Gaines said: &#8220;Our mission is to provide voters with the information and resources necessary to successfully cast their votes.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Zareen Farhad, a 19-year-old student at Virginia Commonwealth University, said she is voting absentee this upcoming election because she can’t make it back to Northern Virginia. Farhad said she has voted absentee three times and that the instructions on the ballot are sufficient, but that the VDE website could clarify when the ballot is due.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think that the Virginia elections website could be a bit more clear about exactly how to vote absentee and when early in-person voting is,” Farhad said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grant Fox, press secretary for the Democratic Party of Virginia, said the organization recently hired a full-time voter protection director to make sure every vote counts and voters are aware of their rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republican and Democratic candidates have highlighted the option to vote absentee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">John Findlay, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia said “we’re encouraged by the absentee numbers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of Monday, the unofficial return count for absentee ballots is 73,903, out of 123,459 absentee ballot applications, <a href="https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2019%20November%20General/Site/Statistics/Absentee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2019%2520November%2520General/Site/Statistics/Absentee.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1572397155709000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGY4zKZRL6_YFU5Yl_1yC8Hec6Y0Q">according to VDE. </a></p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Using absentee voting is a good indicator of potential turnout, and if you look at previous elections and compare it to today there has been an increase in this election and overall,&#8221; said VDE commissioner Christopher Piper, in a previous CNS interview.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stakes are high with all 140 legislative seats up for grabs for this first time since 2015, but also since Donald Trump was elected president. Several Senate districts held by Republicans have leaned blue in recent elections since then, and voters pushed Democrats into the House en masse in 2017. Republicans currently hold a slim majority in both chambers of the legislature.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to an analysis posted by the Virginia Public Access Project, 54 House districts have already surpassed the number of absentee ballots returned in 2015. Of those, 22 are also key House races determined by a CNS analysis of competitive races, redistricting changes and recent voting trends on Virginia Public Access Project. The top five House districts that have seen over twice the number of return absentee ballots compared to 2015 are:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">HD 76 – Del. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, facing Democratic challenger Clinton Jenkins.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">HD 78 – Del. Jay Leftwich, R-Chesapeake, running unopposed.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">HD 77 – Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, running unopposed.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">HD 9 – Democrat Martha Mulger and Republican Colleen Holcomb are running for an open seat in a Republican-held district where Hillary Clinton won in 2016.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">HD 66 – Del. Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights faces challengers Democrat Sheila Bynum-Coleman and Independent Linnard Harris Sr.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Twenty-one Senate districts have also had a higher return in absentee ballots than in 2015. Three of the key senate races identified by CNS have had higher returns this year than 2015.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Residents who wish to vote absentee must apply for a mailed absentee ballot by 5 p.m. Tuesday through the VDE <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/citizen-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/citizen-portal/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1572397155709000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGjy_4tjGCq9bhYoJcH2uz6baOq6A">online citizens portal</a> or their local voter registration office. The deadline to return absentee ballots to registration officers is Election Day at 7 p.m.</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:12px;"></p><p><strong>By McKenzie Lambert/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p>With less than two weeks until the election, campaign finance reports show that not only are Democrats bringing in the most money, but Democratic women are leading the pack with donations received.</p>
<p>“Their strong fundraising is indicative of the incredible support they have, particularly from grassroots donors,” said Kathryn Gilley, communications director for Virginia House Democrats.</p>
<p>Gilley said more Democratic women in the House would provide a greater voice and support for female-friendly policies, including providing equal pay for women and increasing access to affordable child care and reproductive choices.</p>
<p>The most recent data from the Virginia Public Access Project, which records contributions from donors to candidates, shows that the top three candidates who raised the most cash and in-kind contributions in the House and Senate in September are female Democratic candidates. In-kind contributions are donated goods and services given to candidates in place of cash donations. These donations can include mailers and postage, hosting campaign events or providing food, lodging, office space and administrative assistance.</p>
<p>The top September fundraisers in the House were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Del. Wendy Gooditis, D-Clarke, raised $580,336. Republican opponent Randy Minchew collected $287,059.</li>
<li>Sheila Bynum-Coleman, running for a seat in House District 66, collected $568,401. Opponent Kirk Cox, R-Colonial Heights, brought in $302,756.</li>
<li>Del. Hala Ayala, D-Prince William, collected $532,974. Opponent Rich Anderson raised $43,299.</li>
</ul>
<p>The top September fundraisers in the Senate were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Del. Debra Rodman, D-Henrico, raised more than $1 million in cash and in-kind contributions as she vies for a seat in the state Senate. Opponent Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, R-Henrico, raised $421,362.</li>
<li>Del. Cheryl Turpin, D-Virginia Beach, collected $676,973 in donations. Republican opponent Jen Kiggans raised $330,128.</li>
<li>Ghazala Hashmi, Democratic candidate running for District 10, collected $645,444. Her opponent, Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Richmond, raised $289,075.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall in September, Democrats running for Senate seats outraised Republicans, $4.9 million to $2 million. In the House, Democrats outraised Republicans, $7.1 million to a little over $4 million.</p>
<p>A majority of the candidates received donations from EMILY&#8217;s List, a political action committee that aims to elect pro-choice Democratic women to office. Earlier this month, the organization said it plans to invest $2.1 million in an effort to flip Virginia’s General Assembly from red to blue. EMILY’s List has endorsed 39 women candidates in Virginia.</p>
<p>“We are hopeful that other individuals and organizations will follow our lead in directing their energy and support to these incredibly important state legislative races that too often remain under-resourced and underfunded,” Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY’s List, said in a recent press release.</p>
<p>In September, EMILY’s List gave Ayala and Gooditis $150,000 each, their top gift that month. Bynum-Coleman was given $125,000, while Hashmi and Turpin received $25,000 and $10,000, respectively. Planned Parenthood, another pro-choice organization, gave Rodman her No. 1 donation in September &#8212; $167,918. Turpin and Hashmi received the most money from the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus that month, $162,500 each.</p>
<p>Bynum-Coleman received the largest donation last month from Everytown For Gun Safety, a PAC that advocates for gun control. The PAC has given $126,000 to Bynum-Coleman, whose daughter survived a gunshot wound while attending a house party. Everytown has spent nearly $5 million during the last three election cycles to elect gun safety champions in the state.</p>
<p>“Virginia lawmakers failed to vote for stronger gun laws and now, in November, voters will have their say in the matter by voting them out of office,” Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a PAC that is part of Everytown, said in a press release earlier this year.</p>
<p>When the September fundraising totals are sorted for cash only, and don’t include in-kind donations, the top three fundraisers shift a little. In the Senate, Rodman remains on top with $507,678 cash raised. Missy Cotter Smasal raised $488,356 cash donations last filing period in her bid against Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, for Senate District 8.</p>
<p>Del. John Bell, D-Loudoun, against Republican Geary Higgins for the Senate District 13 seat, raised $488,027 cash in September.</p>
<p>In the House, based on strictly cash donations, Bynum-Coleman is the top fundraiser ($470,456) followed by Ayala ($460,061) and Gooditis ($419,733). Republican Mary Margaret Kastelberg, running for House District 73, was in fourth place for most cash-only donations, at $308, 751.The cash may be flowing in for Democratic women, but that won’t necessarily translate to votes on Nov. 5.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to know who will actually show up on Election Day, and political scientists are often surprised,” said Tracy Roof, political science professor at the University of Richmond. “If there is a lot of intensity among Democratic voters this year and lack of enthusiasm among Republicans, the typical dynamic could shift in favor of the Democrats.”</p>

However, some of those tribes refused to become subservient or pay tribute to her. She is depicted in her statue holding a bronze signed treaty.

<p dir="ltr">The nation’s first monument created to showcase remarkable women of Virginia now stands on Capitol Square.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hundreds watched the unveiling Monday of the Virginia Women’s Monument, which features seven statues honoring women from different parts of the commonwealth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mary Margaret Whipple, vice chair of the Women’s Monument Commission, said the monument embodies the goals of the commission to honor real women in a way that is not mythic or symbolic. The Virginia General Assembly established the commission to determine and recommend an appropriate women’s monument for Capitol Square in 2010.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These women rose to the occasion and made significant achievements,” Whipple said. “They were from all walks of life. From different times and places. They were famous and obscure. Real women. Even imperfect women. Who have shaped the history of this commonwealth.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Clerk of the Senate Susan Clarke Schaar spoke about the decade-long process for the design and realization of the monument. She worked with professors and historians to design the structure.</p>
<figure id="attachment_12058" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:683px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-12058 size-large" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Womens_monument-683x1024.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="1024" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Womens_monument-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Womens_monument-200x300.jpg 200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Womens_monument-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Womens_monument-696x1044.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Womens_monument-1068x1602.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Womens_monument-280x420.jpg 280w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Womens_monument-1920x2880.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Womens_monument.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia Randolph was a Richmond-born educator who attended Richmond Colored Normal School (now Armstrong High) and taught in Goochland, Hanover and Henrico counties.

Her statue, part of the Virginia Women&#8217;s Monument unveiled Monday, holds a book and looks out across the Capitol lawn. (VCU Capital News Service)</p></figure>
<p dir="ltr">“No pedestals, no weapons, no horses,” Schaar said. “They wanted it to be approachable. They wanted it to be warm and welcoming. And they wanted to convey a sense of consensus building. And they wanted young women and young men to know that they could do anything they wanted to do with their lives.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gov. Ralph Northam said the monument is long overdue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For far too long we have overlooked the transformative contributions of women and other underrepresented groups,” said Northam. “Until recently that has been the case on Capitol Square as well.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Capitol Square is also home to the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial, opened in 2008, and “Mantle,” a monument dedicated to Virginia’s Indian tribes in 2018.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Artist Kehinde Wiley<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/arts/design/kehinde-wiley-times-square-statue.html" target="_blank"> last month in Times Square</a> unveiled “Rumors of War,” a statue of a young African-American man on a horse in a pose modeled after Confederate monuments. The statue will be permanently moved to the entrance of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts on Arthur Ashe Boulevard in December.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This year is the 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage in America. It also marks the 400th anniversary of the first slaves arriving in Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Ryan McDougle, a Republican running for reelection in the 4th District, brought his daughter Reagan on stage with him. He said the monument was about inspiring the accomplishments of women yet to come.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It’s about Reagan, and all the girls here today, and all the girls that will come; whether they have those role models in their families or not, they will be able to see that women that have come before them have achieved tremendous things,” McDougle said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When the monument is completed it will feature a dozen bronze statues on a granite plaza and an etched glass Wall of Honor <a href="http://womensmonumentcom.virginia.gov/wallofhonornames.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://womensmonumentcom.virginia.gov/wallofhonornames.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1571237477809000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtSBVqlpwl3mtKT6BjCXtPglkC3g">inscribed with 230 names</a> of notable Virginian women and room for more. For a future honoree to qualify for the wall, she must be a native Virginian or have lived mostly in Virginia and must be deceased for at least 10 years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The granite wall features a quote excerpted from a 1912 address that Mary Johnston, a 20th century Virginian author, made to an all-male Richmond conference of state governors:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It did not come up in a night, the woman movement, and it is in no danger of perishing from view. It is here to stay and grow … It is indestructible, it is moving on with an ever- increasing depth and velocity, and it is going to revolutionize the world.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The seven completed statues are Anne Burras Laydon, a Jamestown colonist; Cockacoeske, Pamunkey chieftain; Mary Draper Ingles, a frontierswoman; Elizabeth Keckly, seamstress and confidante to Mary Todd Lincoln; Laura Copenhaver, an entrepreneur in the textile industry; Virginia Randolph, an educator; and Adèle Clark, suffragist and artist.</p>

She was also instrumental in establishing Virginia’s Art Commission.<br />Her statue holds a “Votes for Women” banner. (VCU Capital News Service)</p></figure>
<p dir="ltr">Five more statues will be added as they are funded and completed — Martha Dandridge Custis Washington, America’s inaugural first lady; Clementina Bird Rind, the first female printer in Virginia; Sally Louisa Tompkins, a hospital administrator; Maggie L.

<p dir="ltr">The statues, which each required a $200,000 investment, were sculpted by New York-based Ivan Schwartz, who also crafted the <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/new-jefferson-statue-goes-on-display-at-state-capitol/article_33728330-510a-50d5-8a62-bd71d1443f7e.html" target="_blank">Capitol’s Thomas Jefferson statue.</a></p>

<p dir="ltr">“Women have been excised from the marble pedestal of history,” Schwartz said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Schwartz has recently worked on other sculptures of notable women around the country. He mentioned projects highlighting Susan B. Anthony, Anne Frank and Harriet Tubman.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I still make sculptures of Abraham Lincoln and George Washington,” Schwartz said. “I don’t turn my back on these good gentlemen. But their gentlemen’s club, which has occupied our national living room, our nation’s public spaces, has at last started to admit women, African Americans and Native Americans.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Girl Scouts unveiled the structures, pulling back a blue cloth as the name of each statue was announced by Susan Allen, chair of the Virginia Capitol Foundation and former first lady of Virginia. The Girl Scouts represented councils from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Virginia Skyline and the Colonial Coast.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Allen gave closing remarks, calling the occasion “a monumental day.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Let us recognize our diverse past, and those on whose shoulders we stand so proudly today and be inspired to work on for a better future for our daughters and the young leaders of tomorrow like these lovely young women here today,” Allen said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In addition to hitting the books this fall, more Virginia college students may hit the polls next month.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Department of Elections data show that 10,923 students in Virginia have applied for absentee ballots this year. That’s more than double the number of absentee ballot applications (4,878) received in 2015, the last year all 140 seats were up for reelection in the General Assembly, according to Christopher Piper, commissioner of the department.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Residents (including students) have requested 66,219 applications for absentee voting, <a href="https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2019%20November%20General/Site/Statistics/Absentee.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2019%2520November%2520General/Site/Statistics/Absentee.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1571168280509000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHXwjpGt_FSNkkkPGfl8IuobgZMmg">according to state election data</a>. Records show that 62,605 absentee ballots were filed four years ago. As of Monday, the state has filed 24,766 absentee ballots; it remains to be seen how many more are returned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Piper said absentee ballots have increased in popularity. Last year, voters submitted 287,763 <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registrationturnout-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registrationturnout-statistics/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1571168280509000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIZatUtr-danTm0dzpeJP7CK_QMw">absentee ballots</a>, the highest number of votes in the state during a non-presidential election based on data available since 1976. The 2008 presidential election had the highest rate of absentee voting recorded in Virginia, with <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registrationturnout-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registrationturnout-statistics/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1571168280510000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkJS77XnrBkgCNsFLa5C-nGdGNag">506,672 absentee</a> votes submitted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Using absentee voting is a good indicator of potential turnout, and if you look at previous elections and compare it to today there has been an increase in this election and overall,” Piper said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Traditionally, voter turnout is highest during presidential elections and drops during state elections. For instance, <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registrationturnout-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registrationturnout-statistics/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1571168280510000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkJS77XnrBkgCNsFLa5C-nGdGNag">72% of registered voters participated</a> in the 2016 presidential election, but turnout for the 2017 gubernatorial election fell to <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registrationturnout-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registrationturnout-statistics/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1571168280510000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHkJS77XnrBkgCNsFLa5C-nGdGNag">48%</a>. That same year, the second highest number of absentee votes, 496,452, were filed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We could potentially have a higher turnout due to the opposition within the 93rd and 94th House districts,” said Vicki Lewis, with the Newport News registrar’s office.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Perhaps this election is predicted to spur higher voter turnout in part because it includes over 30 competitive races. Further, redistricting maps gave an advantage to some House Democrats, who hope to wrest back the slim majority Republicans hold &#8212; in both chambers. As of Sept. 30, Virginia had 5,612,769 registered voters. In the 2015 election, nearly 5.2 million residents registered to vote and a little over 1.5 million, or 29%, actually voted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Erin Burke Brown, the voter registration and turnout chair for VCU Votes, which promotes voter engagement at Virginia Commonwealth University, said it remains to be seen whether young voters will show up to the polls.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It depends on whether young people are fired up to want things to change and have their voices heard,” Brown said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The last day to register to vote is today. Applications for absentee ballots can be found <a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/absentee-voting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/absentee-voting/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1571168280510000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyDkNkc_8vAqnDO8dgvdcGDsbMwQ">online</a> or by visiting the local registrar’s office. The deadline to request an absentee ballot by mail is Oct. 29. The deadline to vote in-person absentee is Nov. 2.</p>

(NBC12)</p><p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>By Jaclyn Barton/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia had the fourth lowest violent crime rate and 13th lowest property crime rate in the United States last year, according to new <u><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2018-crime-statistics" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-releases-2018-crime-statistics&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1570830000418000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFY_j6nab-sLS2xKiXLsgsNKLJM1g" target="_blank">data from the FBI</a></u>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The commonwealth had 200 violent crimes per 100,000 residents in 2018, the data showed. Only Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire had a lower violent crime rate. Nationally, there were 369 violent offenses per 100,000 population.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia had about 1,666 property crimes per 100,000 inhabitants. A dozen states — topped by New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Vermont — had lower property crime rates. Nationwide, the rate was 2,200 property crimes per 100,000 population.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">From 2017 to 2018, the violent crime rate decreased 3% and the property crime rate fell 7% nationwide and in Virginia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">All of Virginia’s metropolitan areas had violent crime rates below the nationwide level, and most were below the national rate for property crimes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Winchester and Harrisonburg metro areas had the least violent crime — fewer than 140 offenses per 100,000 population.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The metro areas with the most violent crime were Roanoke (235 offenses per 100,000 residents), Richmond (239), Washington-Arlington-Alexandria (265) and Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News (307).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia metro areas with the least property crime were Harrisonburg (1,137 offenses per 100,000 population) and Lynchburg (1,350). The metro areas with the most property crime were Richmond (2,156 offenses per 100,000 residents), Roanoke (2,378) and Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News (2,405).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Under the FBI’s definition, violent crimes include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Property crimes include burglary, larceny-theft and motor vehicle theft.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although Virginia’s overall statewide and metro-area crimes rates generally were low, the data revealed some trouble spots — especially regarding homicides.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, there were 5 murders for every 100,000 people last year. Virginia’s murder rate was 4.6 per 100,000 population.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Most Virginia metro areas had murder rates below the national average. For example, the Winchester area didn’t report any homicides last year; the Blacksburg-Christiansburg area had just one; and the Charlottesville area had three (for a rate of 1.4 per 100,000 population).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But the murder rates in the Washington-Arlington-Alexandria and Lynchburg metro areas were at the national average of 5 killings per 100,000 residents. The murder rates exceeded the national level in Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News and the Roanoke metro areas (about 7 murders per 100,000 residents) and the Richmond area (almost 8 murders per 100,000 population).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Murder rates were well above the national average in several Virginia cities, the FBI data showed. The murder rate last year was 44 killings per 100,000 population in Petersburg, 27 in Danville, 23 in Richmond, 21 in Portsmouth and 15 in Norfolk.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 490 U.S. cities with a population between 25,000 and 35,000, only three had a higher murder rate than Petersburg. (One of the three was Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in 2018.)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 31 U.S. cities with a population between 200,000 and 250,000, only two (Birmingham, Alabama, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana) had a murder rate higher than Richmond last year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Among cities in Virginia, Portsmouth, Newport News, Richmond, Norfolk and Roanoke all had violent crime rates and property crime rates above the national average.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Roanoke Police Department is active in community outreach programs created to reduce crime. They include neighborhood watch groups, a summer youth basketball league and programs to help students read and do their homework. Police officials attend as many as 30 community events each month.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“There is no way to determine causation factors for a potential decrease in crime. It could be a number of different reasons, and we cannot determine that any of our community outreach or crime prevention has impacted the crime rates,” said Caitlyn Cline, who does community outreach, public information and crime prevention for the Roanoke Police Department.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, Richmond reported 52 murders — more than any other city or county in Virginia. Still, that was a far cry from two decades ago.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think Richmond or Virginia has a particularly high murder rate relative to places like Maryland and Baltimore,” said Patrick Lowery, assistant professor of criminal justice at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He said that in 1994, the number of murders in Richmond “peaked at 160. In 2014, we were down to 43, so that’s about four times less homicides relative to 10 or 15 years ago.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, violent crime in every major American city has decreased since the early 1990s. Lowery attributes that to many factors, such as community outreach programs and changing sentencing laws.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <u><a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1570830000418000&amp;usg=AFQjCNESAzOL6ll8N3fDDCj9OozInR0UgA" target="_blank">FBI data release</a></u>, from an annual report called Crime in the United States, represents statistics reported by about 16,700 law-enforcement agencies last year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In June, the Virginia State Police issued a state-level report called <u><a href="https://www.vsp.virginia.gov/downloads/Crime_in_Virginia/Crime_in_Virginia_2018.pdf" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vsp.virginia.gov/downloads/Crime_in_Virginia/Crime_in_Virginia_2018.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1570830000418000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFl_T6ao7aoKWNmSzZfhvn4NCeN9w" target="_blank">Crime in Virginia</a></u>. The State Police report covered additional crimes such as kidnapping and abduction.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A total of 1,696 kidnapping and abduction offenses were reported in 2018. That number was up 6% from 2017. Prince William County had the most kidnappings last year — 111.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not as if random people are getting snatched off the street,” said Sgt. Jonathan Perock, supervisor for the Prince William County Police Department. “The majority of the time, it’s a domestic incident in which both parties are known to one another.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">When Eva Solano returned home after spending 28 days in immigration detention, she knew she wasn’t going to go back to her normal life and pretend nothing had happened.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I told my lawyer, ‘I need to do something,’” Solano said. “It’s not about me. I’m the lucky one.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Solano joined the board of the Cville Immigrant Bond Fund, which launched in May, a few months after leaving the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly known as ICE, detention facility in Caroline County. Her boss had put forward $6,000 to bail her out, and coworkers raised an additional $4,000 in support.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At that point, there wasn’t a bond or legal defense fund that could help Solano in Virginia. And while that’s changed with the launch of the Cville Fund and Santos en Virginia — which started in July and eventually hopes to serve the entire state — advocates say many people still are unable to afford bail or legal expenses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We haven’t begun to meet the need,” said Priscilla Mendenhall, executive director of the Cville Fund, which serves people in Charlottesville and Albemarle and Nelson counties. “But a lot of it is need that doesn’t even emerge because people are too afraid to come forward, too afraid to even fight their cases.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a Syracuse University <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/detention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/detention/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1570582503232000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEDa4ju1OG7k7LrQuaVh6VPZ6J40w">database</a>, 982 people were in ICE detention in Virginia as of December, the most recent month with available data. About a third of those people — the largest individual category — had never been convicted of a crime. Each month that data was collected, the number of detainees increased. In September 2016, the first month when data was collected, there were 672 people in detention, and about 14% had no criminal convictions. About the same proportion were convicted of a DUI.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The same database reports that as of August, the median bond granted in a hearing in Virginia was $7,000. Unlike other bonds, ICE bonds have to be paid all at once, Mendenhall said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If they can’t get bonded out, they’re stuck in detention,” Mendenhall said. “If they’re stuck in detention, it’s much harder for them to actually work with an attorney.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mendenhall said Cville’s fundraising has gone well, but there’s an ongoing need to raise more money.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Leonina Arismendi, the co-founder of Santos en Virginia, said 10 people make up the $100,000 in requests that the organization has received thus far.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So whatever scale of fundraising we thought we were going to be doing,” said Lana Heath de Martínez, the other co-founder, as Arismendi continued, “it just blew our minds, how much was needed so soon.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The group has gone back to the drawing board to figure out a new fundraising plan, Arismendi said. They’re looking into creative ways to raise money, such as launching music and art events and reaching out to restaurants owners about hosting a fundraising event.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re just looking at the most creative ways to find the money we need, and not to find it once, but to find it constantly,” Arismendi said, “because these requests keep coming.”</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidate Del. Debra Rodman is running against Republican incumbent Siobhan Dunnavant, both from Henrico.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A total of $1,240,125 has been spent on media buys for District 12, according to an analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project. That includes ad space purchased through Nov. 4.  Advertisements that are pro-Rodman or anti-Dunnavant have totaled $659,920, while ads that are pro-Dunnavant or anti-Rodman have totaled $580,205.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Rodman’s media buys for two political commercials will account for 997 on-air plays while Dunnavant will have 626 <a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/state-senate-12/media-buys/committee-rodman-for-senate-debra/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vpap.org/offices/state-senate-12/media-buys/committee-rodman-for-senate-debra/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1570581193233000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFlM_43WkYposEe-qxmlXVjhsgkiQ" target="_blank">media plays</a>, according to VPAP, which compiled Federal Communications Commission public disclosure files. Dunnavant has raised $1,104,094 to Rodman’s $812,329, as of Aug. 31 campaign reports. The next reports will be released in mid-October.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Media buys in the District 10 race between incumbent Glen Sturtevant, R-Richmond, and Democratic challenger Ghazala Hashmi tally at $581,235, according to VPAP. That’s $658,890 less than the total media buys for the District 12 race.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“All indications are that things are still quite close in a lot of these districts and that means that there’s going to be more and more money poured into these races this last month before the election,” said Stephen Farnsworth, professor of political science and director of the University of Mary Washington&#8217;s Center for Leadership and Media Studies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">District 12 will be a tight race leading up to the election on Nov. 5. Rodman hopes to flip the district blue. Constituents voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and Gov. Ralph Northam in the 2017 gubernatorial election — both Democrats — but Republicans have held this legislative district since 1999.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whichever party controls the General Assembly after the upcoming election will have an impact on redistricting after the 2020 census.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The people who are elected in November may end up drawing the lines after the 2020 census,” Farnsworth said. “And so having partisan control this cycle matters a great deal.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is also considering a constitutional amendment that will take the line-drawing authority away from legislatures. The <a href="https://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2019/hj615/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.richmondsunlight.com/bill/2019/hj615/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1570581193233000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFiCrl1pj8VLeUhLJzo_3Qd72FfwA" target="_blank">proposed amendment </a>cleared the General Assembly in the 2019 session but will again have to pass both chambers next session and then be approved by voters in November 2020 before it takes effect.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The other top media buys go to Senate races in the 7th, 8th and 17th Districts.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">One person has died in Virginia from a lung injury associated with vaping, as the number of illnesses linked to e-cigarette use increases in the state and across the country, the Virginia Department of Health announced Tuesday.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The death was reported by Cone Health in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Thursday, and the Department of Health said the patient was an adult from Southwest Virginia. Citing patient privacy, the department did not release additional details.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I am deeply saddened to announce the first death of a Virginia resident related to this outbreak,” said State Health Commissioner M. Norman Oliver. “Our thoughts are with the family during this difficult time.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As of Monday, there have been 31 lung injury cases, including the patient who died, in Virginia. The cases <u><a href="http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/vdhlivewell/vaping/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.vdh.virginia.gov/vdhlivewell/vaping/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1570049904975000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGbabz-KkJ4fGQ8_llPAzx0KbBVtA" target="_blank">include</a></u> 15 in Northern Virginia, seven in Eastern Virginia, five in Northwest Virginia, three in Southwest Virginia and one in Central Virginia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The number of cases has grown since Sept. 20, when the Department of Health had confirmed 16 cases of lung illnesses linked to vaping and seven suspected cases.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <u><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1570049904975000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGDm-MYHVEwZYueX44xUSXUeZqoJw" target="_blank">reported</a></u> last week that there have been 805 cases across 46 states and one U.S. territory. The CDC said there had been 12 deaths; that number did not include the one in Virginia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While the cause of the outbreak is still unknown, officials have flagged the vitamin E found in many tested samples containing THC, marijuana’s main psychoactive compound. The Virginia Department of Health advises people not to use e-cigarettes, and those who do should not buy products off the street or modify them in a way not intended by the manufacturer.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">About 1.3 million students across Virginia went back to school after summer vacation. But for Alison Hatter’s three children, that didn’t require getting on a bus or even going outside. Instead, their classroom is the kitchen of the family’s home in Floyd County.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We usually wake between 6-7 a.m., and we aim to start at 9 a.m. at our kitchen table, where we read our Bible, pray, then begin our table work,” said Hatter, an artist who grew up and still lives in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Southwest Virginia. She home-schools her three children, ages 8, 11 and 14.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Hatter children are among more than 43,500 students statewide who study at home instead of attending a public or private school. It’s an increasingly popular option for families: The number of home-schoolers in Virginia has grown more than 20% over the past five years.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If home-schoolers were a school division unto themselves, they would represent the seventh-largest district in the state.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Statewide, home-schoolers make up about 3% of the total student enrollment. In some communities, the proportion is a lot higher.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, for example, 315 students in Floyd County were home-schooled. About 1,975 students attended Floyd County Public Schools — so home-schoolers constituted about 14% of the county’s total enrollment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The first and strongest reason is my husband and I are Christians,” said Hatter, who graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University in 1998 with a bachelor of fine arts degree. “And before we had children, we made it our goal to home-school or provide a private Christian education.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Floyd County was among seven school divisions in Virginia where at least 1 out of every 10 students was home-schooled last year, according to a Capital News Service analysis of <u><a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/statistics_reports/enrollment/index.shtml" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.doe.virginia.gov/statistics_reports/enrollment/index.shtml&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1569981908122000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFVlJHCwUzQEI5yYz2lKbWxRb7VXQ" target="_blank">data from the Virginia Department of Education</a></u>. Other districts were:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Surry County, at 14%</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Warren County, at 11%</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Bedford, Madison, King and Queen, and Clarke counties, at 10%</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">About 25 school districts have seen their numbers of home-schoolers surge by more than 50% between the 2013-14 and 2018-19 academic years.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in Chesapeake City Public Schools, the number of home-schoolers increased by 72% — to 2,100 students. In Charlottesville, Scott County and Petersburg, the number of home-schoolers doubled.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Several groups have sprung up to help parents home-school their children by providing teaching materials, organizing field trips and events, and offering legal assistance and other support. The groups include:</p>

</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hatter is a member of the Home Educators Association and the Legal Defense Association.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve used my membership for teachers discounts, legal counsel, state requirements for school and diplomas, blogs, podcasts, education tips and providers and curriculum previews,” she said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Education also has <u><a href="http://www.doe.virginia.gov/families/private_home/index.shtml" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.doe.virginia.gov/families/private_home/index.shtml&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1569981908122000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtz9egtLEDsGWETsizubS_5UwD_g" target="_blank">resources for home-schooling families</a></u>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Under state law, parents who want to home-school their children must notify their local school division by Aug. 15. By the following Aug. 1, the parent must provide “evidence of the child’s academic progress,” such as scores on a &#8220;nationally normed standardized achievement test&#8221; like the California Achievement Test or the Stanford Achievement Test, a report card from a distance learning program or correspondence school, or an evaluation by a licensed teacher.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has relaxed its laws on home schooling over the past 15-20 years, according to Charles Pyle, the director of media relations at the Virginia Department of Education. For instance, a parent is no longer required to have a four-year college degree to home-school a child.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There can be disadvantages to home schooling. For one thing, home-schoolers cannot join the sports teams of their local public high school. The Virginia High School League, which oversees interscholastic competitions, forbids home-schooled students from participating.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For years, home-schooling advocates have pushed for a state law to let school districts decide whether local home-schooled students can play school sports.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“<u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2102" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191%2Bsum%2BHB2102&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1569981908122000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFoBTQo8562bUUXJcA39WCgJBhAcQ" target="_blank">Legislation in the 2019 General Assembly</a></u> to remove barriers to participation was defeated in the House Education Committee,” Pyle said. “At present, the level of participation of home-schooled students is determined by the local school board and Virginia High School League rules.”</p>

(Capital News Service)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Morgan Edwards / Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">NEW YORK &#8212; Artist Kehinde Wiley unveiled his monumental statue “Rumors of War” in Times Square on Friday &#8212; his response to the Confederate sculptures scattered throughout the South, especially in Richmond, which eventually will serve as its permanent home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The statue is closely modeled after the statue of Confederate general J.E.B. Stuart found in the center of Stuart Circle along Monument Avenue in Richmond. It depicts a triumphant and confident young African American man wearing street clothes atop a rearing horse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is his first attempt at a monumental sculpture, and I’d have to say he pretty much hit it out of the park,” Virginia Museum of Fine Arts Director Alex Nyerges said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Sean Kelly Gallery founder Sean Kelly, “Rumors of War” is 27 feet tall, and 1 foot taller than the statue of Stuart. The New York-based art gallery represents Wiley and other established artists. It co-sponsored the unveiling along with the <span class="il">VMFA</span> and the Times Square Alliance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wiley has become known for paintings depicting African American men and women shown in classical poses. His paintings are inspired by masters from the Renaissance and Rococo eras of art but with a contemporary and political twist. In 2018 he unveiled the official portrait of President Barack Obama in the Smithsonian National Gallery, garnering worldwide attention.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He came up with the idea to create the statue during the 2016 showing of a retrospective of his work at the <span class="il">VMFA</span>. Nyerges said Wiley approached the museum about collaborating on the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“When they approached us the question was, ‘Would you be interested in working with us on a project like this,’ and of course the answer was an instant ‘yes,’” Nyerges said. “Then when Kehinde and Sean came back to us with some visuals and a conceptual of what it looked like, we were blown away.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The statue has been under construction for almost three years. Kelly said he feels overjoyed to have Wiley’s newest work completed and released.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The beginning of the journey is absolutely terrifying if you think about what you’re getting yourself into,” Kelly said. “Unveiling it today is like giving birth; it’s super exciting and amazing. There’s nothing but euphoria and joy at this point.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stoney addressed how “Rumors of War” will fit into the ongoing conversation about the monuments on Monument Avenue. Five other statues honoring Confederates, and one statue in tribute to tennis legend Arthur Ashe, are erected along a 1.5-mile stretch of the city street. In recent years there has been considerable debate about whether to remove the monuments. The mayor established a commission to study and make recommendations on the removal or relocation of the monuments. The panel’s final report called for removal of the Jefferson Davis statue, and the addition of context to the others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Our friends who worked on the Monument Avenue Commission stated that addition has to be part of the recipe for us balancing the scales in Richmond in terms of the monuments we currently have to the Lost Cause [the narrative that the Confederacy was justified in its rebellion, minimizing the role slavery played in causing the Civil War] and balancing that with heroes and sheroes from African American culture,” Stoney said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The statue will be on temporary public display until Dec. 1 and then moved to its permanent home at the <span class="il">VMFA</span> in Richmond. The public can see the statue unveiled for a second time Dec. 10 on the museum’s front lawn along Arthur Ashe Boulevard.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>By Patricia Cason / Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Same-sex couples have made up 1 of every 26 marriages in Virginia since such unions were legalized in the commonwealth in 2014. In a half-dozen localities — ranging from cities such as Richmond and Norfolk to rural communities like Buena Vista — same-sex couples represent approximately 1 of every 15 marriages.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk, for example, recorded about 12,400 marriages from 2014 through 2018, according to the Virginia Department of Health. About 850 of those weddings were same-sex marriages, the agency’s data showed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">That means same-sex couples constituted almost 7 percent — or about 1 of every 15 marriages — in Norfolk.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">George Schaefer, the Norfolk Circuit Court clerk, offered several possibilities why his locality is so popular with same-sex couples. At the top of his list was convenience.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We are centrally located within the Hampton Roads region,” Schaefer said. “You can get a marriage license at any courthouse in Virginia. We may be the most convenient location. Furthermore, we have a marriage commissioner on site whose office is literally 15 feet from the counter.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Schaefer also cited pent-up demand for same-sex weddings in Southeastern Virginia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Gay couples in heavily populated Northern Virginia who wanted to be married may have already gone across the border (to Maryland and Washington, D.C.) to legally wed by the time the (U.S. Supreme) Court authorized it in Virginia in October 2014,” Schaefer said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><iframe loading="lazy" style="border: none;" title="Percentage of same-sex marriages&amp;nbsp;" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Yybvf/1/" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="USA virginia counties choropleth map"></iframe></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Same-sex marriage was legalized in Virginia on Oct. 6, 2014, when the Supreme Court let stand a lower court ruling that declared the state’s ban on such marriages unconstitutional. The ban had been challenged by two men who wanted to get married in Norfolk.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down all state bans on same-sex marriage.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Like Norfolk, Charlottesville and Roanoke also had relatively high proportions of same-sex marriage — about 1 in 15 weddings, according to a Capital News Service analysis of the Health Department’s data. Then came Richmond, where 1 in 16 marriages was same-sex.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Of the approximately 8,960 marriages recorded in Richmond from 2014 to 2018, nearly 565 were same-sex.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Edward Jewett, the Richmond Circuit Court clerk, says same-sex couples apparently see the capital city as inviting.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“As the clerk’s office in an urban locality, we may have been perceived as a welcoming place to get them [marriage licenses] at first,” Jewett said. “But as things have become routine, things have now spread out. The Charlottesville clerk and I still have a friendly disagreement as to which of us issued the first license.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although each locality has a different set of forms to obtain a marriage license, most require the applicants to <u><a href="https://ccr.fairfaxcounty.gov/mlweb/default.aspx" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ccr.fairfaxcounty.gov/mlweb/default.aspx&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1569633802003000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGZbVs1-QrkFY8eGrydRTp5xcHaRw" target="_blank">circle bride, groom, spouse 1 or spouse 2</a></u>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2014 and 2018, same-sex couples made up about 11,360 of the 300,865 marriages recorded in Virginia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach has recorded more same-sex marriages — 1,155 — than any other locality. They represent about 1 in 21 marriages performed there.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tina Sinnen, the Virginia Beach Circuit court clerk, couldn’t cite a specific reason why the coastal city consistently has the highest number of marriages, both same-sex and overall (almost 25,000 over the four years).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia [Beach] is a beautiful place to get married considering we are a resort city,” Sinnen said. “Possibly my staff is very welcoming and inclusive.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Of the more than 130 localities in Virginia, only Bland and Highland counties and the city of Manassas Park did not have a single same-sex marriage.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The locality with the highest proportion of same-sex marriages was Buena Vista, a city of 6,240 people nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Of the 201 marriages recorded in Buena Vista from 2014 to 2018, 14 were same-sex. That is 1 in 14, or 7 percent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Coleman, the Buena Vista Circuit Court clerk, declined to comment on his locality’s proportion of same-sex marriages.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now that same-sex couples represent a growing proportion of marriages in Virginia, will they also constitute a sizable proportion of divorces? Bill Harrison, the president and director of the Richmond-based LBGTQ rights organization Diversity Richmond doesn’t think so.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Many gay and lesbian people who are now officially married have already been coupled for many years,” Harrison said. “Chances are they will not divorce. Hopefully that will help the 50 percent divorce rate set by our heterosexual friends.”</p>

(Central Appalachia Climbers Coalition via CNS)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Jeff Raines</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">In light of dwindling coal resources and shrinking populations, eco-tourism is becoming an alternative source of revenue in the coalfield counties of Southwest Virginia as residents seek to diversify their economies.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span lang="EN">The Southwestern Virginia coalfields — comprised of Buchanan, Dickenson, Lee, Russell, Scott, Tazewell and Wise counties, alongside the city of Norton — lost 73% of their coal production from 1990 to 2017, according to the </span><span lang="EN"><a href="https://www.dmme.virginia.gov/dgmr/coal.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dmme.virginia.gov/dgmr/coal.shtml&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1569550748145000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGwVgSFHUjWVY-WlO5XrH2FMrR8ZA">Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy</a></span><span lang="EN">. This has resulted in a major loss in jobs for residents of the coalfields who are packing up and moving out of the region.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Population projections show that the coalfields region will shrink in population by about 13% between 2020 and 2040, according to an analysis of data from the <a href="https://demographics.coopercenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://demographics.coopercenter.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1569535306868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHoGNa6nVXeMSRixKea1vctygi_Ww">University of Virginia&#8217;s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service</a>. According to the Coalfield Economic Development Authority, this is partly due to an economy reliant on a few industries.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, residents of the area are turning to the local mountains, crags and cliffs to provide a new source of income. Their efforts were recognized this month when professional rock climber Sasha DiGiulian of Alexandria and over 60 other professional climbers and leaders in outdoor recreation, met with Congressional representatives and policymakers to discuss opportunities, many of which could affect Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Development of Outdoor Recreation and Ecotourism</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia has world-class climbing that could bring adventurous tourists to the region, according to Bradly Mathisen, co-founder and area representative for the <a href="https://www.climbcentralappalachia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.climbcentralappalachia.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1569535306868000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtksgXutVZ5O3w51AUk7ofv9qa2g">Central Appalachia Climbers Coalition</a>. “Traditionally a lot of this region&#8217;s been tied to coal and tied to a specific image,” Mathisen said. “And it seems like a lot of towns around here are trying to shift that image to tourism and natural beauty and outdoor recreation.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mathisen said that CACC hopes to build on rock climbing in the region as a way of getting residents more involved in the communities they are in and highlighting the natural beauty around them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CACC has been working to build up the climbing areas with the support of other local climbing organizations and the Access Fund, a nonprofit that promotes responsible climbing, outdoor recreation and conservation efforts in the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Small towns and cities throughout the region are also starting to take part in developing spaces for outdoor recreation and could soon become a national destination for tourism, according to Zachary Lesch-Huie, southeast regional director of the Access Fund. “Outdoor recreation and adventure tourism is being actively promoted by local and state initiatives,” Lesch-Huie said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Access Fund, CACC and several other local climbing organizations are developing and maintaining climbing areas in Grayson Highlands State Park in Grayson County, Hidden Valley Wildlife Management Area in Washington County, and Guest River Gorge in Scott and Wise counties. The city of Norton and town of Appalachia also have opened climbing areas.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Earlier this year DiGiulian, the professional rock climber, worked alongside CACC to help promote a new climbing area in the Breaks Interstate Park, located on the Virginia-Kentucky border in Dickenson County. DiGiulian has spent time developing climbing routes in the park, which she said allows her to give back and have the local economy and businesses participate in eco-tourism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Climbing brings a lot of really, otherwise rural areas this immense amount of development and revitalized infrastructure,” DiGiulian said in a panel discussion following meetings with Congressional representatives.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DiGiulian said “The Breaks” is an example of state-encouraged development within the eco-tourism discussion.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Legislation Pushed at Climb the Hill</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">DiGiulian joined dozens of professional climbers — including Alex Honnold of California, Tommy Caldwell of Colorado, California native Shelma Jun and Taimur Ahmad, who grew up in New York City  — on Thursday in Washington D.C to talk with Congressional representatives and policymakers at Climb the Hill, an annual event sponsored by the Access Fund and American Alpine Club. The Climb the Hill team pushed on a number of bills, raised awareness, and asked for support from Congressional representatives, according to Lesch-Huie.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Climb the Hill advocated for legislation relating to public land management, outdoor recreation, climate change, and conservation and drew attention to the following bills to Congressional representatives:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">These bills will directly affect Virginia’s public lands and outdoor recreation resources, according to Lesch-Huie. For example, they will help streamline the permitting process for outdoor recreation activities in public lands, making the process easier and more accessible to the public, as well as address funding for the maintenance and development of public lands for recreational activities. Issues of conservation and use of public land and water are also addressed in the proposed bills, in keeping with the ultimate goal of preserving them.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lesch-Huie said the Access Fund and Climb the Hill don’t have official endorsements from any state or national representatives. However, DiGiulian finds that Virginia Democratic legislators Rep. Don Beyer and Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner “do a fabulous job of partaking in this discussion.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Virginia is a great steward of its climbing areas,” DiGiulian said. “I see potential for the state to embrace the development of new climbing areas and to continue to support our outdoor spaces.”</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Online, local officials offer resources and encouragement for people to relocate to Highland County, the most sparsely populated in Virginia. A brochure urges readers to consider Highland’s “elevated lifestyle.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But Highland County faces an uphill battle in attracting new residents. Demographers at the University of Virginia predict that the county’s population, now about 2,260, will drop 17% over the next two decades.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Of the state’s 133 cities and counties, U.Va.’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service <u><a href="https://demographics.coopercenter.org/virginia-population-projections/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://demographics.coopercenter.org/virginia-population-projections/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1568956980470000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEzw0xXEMg4_UUItT8wCarlmlmqfQ" target="_blank">projects</a></u> that 53 will lose population by 2040. Most of those shrinking localities are in south, southwest and western Virginia.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“These areas are losing population every time the population is counted,” said Augie Wallmeyer, author of the book “Extremes of Virginia.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“With a few minor exceptions, they just don’t have what it takes to retain people or attract new people.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" style="border: none;" title="Population boom and bust" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/tEJEi/1/" width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="USA virginia counties choropleth map"></iframe></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the localities projected to lose population offer tranquility, clean air and beautiful views, but they lack job opportunities. Some also lack high-speed internet access that businesses need.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Wallmeyer said rural areas may lack sufficient health care and educational opportunities as well.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The state has implemented programs such as <u><a href="https://govirginia.org/about/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://govirginia.org/about/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1568956980470000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEu9EBGObTQN9ntyfIk4rSudKxucA" target="_blank">GO Virginia</a></u> to encourage the growth of high-paying jobs throughout the commonwealth. Community colleges also are offering more job training programs. But Wallmeyer said there has been a lack of coordination among efforts to address problems in rural counties.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Without coordination, you may find, for example, that GO Virginia might find a way to attract jobs to a county. But if the educational opportunities are very limited or if there is no good health care nearby or a terrible drug abuse problem or no amenities like Starbucks and that sort of thing, the effort fails,” Wallmeyer said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The available workforce in rural counties becomes even smaller after factoring in age.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><u><a href="http://statchatva.org/2019/07/01/population-projections-show-that-virginia-is-aging-and-growing-more-slowly/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://statchatva.org/2019/07/01/population-projections-show-that-virginia-is-aging-and-growing-more-slowly/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1568956980471000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmg-0FsSzSFvZkKaxE5MkjrFVUNg" target="_blank">In an analysis of the data,</a></u> Shonel Sen, a research and policy analyst for the Weldon Cooper Center’s Demographics Research Group, said that by next year, more than 30% of the residents in rural counties like Highland are expected to be over 65. That is double the statewide proportion of people over 65.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By 2040, people over 65 would make up more than 35% of the population of Highland and Lancaster counties, according to the center’s projections.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Having so many residents at retirement age subtracts from the available workforce. An aging population also creates a greater demand for health care, which many rural areas are struggling to provide.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The population trends affect not just the economy but also politics, Wallmeyer said. As rural counties shrink, so does their legislative representation. This makes it difficult to make their issues a priority at the state level.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It bodes ill for people in those areas who think the political system can fix their problems,” Wallmeyer said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Demographics Research Group predicts that while parts of Virginia face drastic population losses, other parts will grapple with dramatic population gains. Overall, the state population will grow 14%, to almost 10 million, by 2040, the projections show.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sen <u><a href="http://statchatva.org/2019/07/01/population-projections-show-that-virginia-is-aging-and-growing-more-slowly/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://statchatva.org/2019/07/01/population-projections-show-that-virginia-is-aging-and-growing-more-slowly/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1568956980471000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFmg-0FsSzSFvZkKaxE5MkjrFVUNg" target="_blank">pointed out</a></u> the “significant rural-urban divide” in Virginia. She noted that currently, 70% of the state’s residents live in the three largest metropolitan areas (Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads and the Richmond area) and only 12% live in non-metro areas.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By 2040, the demographers predict, Loudoun County would grow 55%, to almost 670,000 residents — adding the equivalent of the current population of Richmond. Loudoun would rise from being the state’s fourth most populous locality to the second, behind only Fairfax County.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The data also project high growth in other localities in Northern Virginia (such as Prince William and Stafford counties) and between Richmond and Williamsburg (New Kent and James City counties).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the number of residents likely will decrease in rural areas. For instance, the center predicts that Buchanan County will lose almost a third of its population, going from more than 21,000 residents to about 14,500. The group’s data suggest that the populations of Danville and Martinsville, as well as Accomack and Grayson counties, will decline by more than one-fifth.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><strong>By Kelly Booth</strong></p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">Over the past four years, voter registration has grown more in Virginia localities that tend to vote Democratic than in localities that usually go Republican. That could spell trouble for the GOP heading into November’s elections.</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">Between August 2015 and August 2019, voter registration increased 9% in the state’s Democratic strongholds but only 6% in Republican strongholds, according to an analysis of data from the Virginia Department of Elections.</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">Democratic Party officials say they are pleased about the trend in a year when Virginians are electing state legislators but not a governor or U.S. senator.</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">“We always say slower turnout with Virginia’s off-year election and fully recognize that this is an off-off year election with no statewide race,” said Kathryn Gilley, communications director for the House Democratic Caucus. “That being said, the fact that there is so much new voter registration &#8230; Virginians are really aware of the importance of this year.”</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">But Jeff Ryer, press secretary for the Virginia Senate Republican Caucus, said an increase in registered voters in Democratic areas doesn’t necessarily mean Democrats will win at the polls. He said something similar happened in Florida in 2016 and 2018, with news stories and opinion surveys predicting victories for Democrats.</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">“Not only did they (Democrats) not prevail, but they lost both,” Ryer said. “One of the things I really like to point out to people is Republicans do much better at the polls than in the polls.”</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">Gilley said Democrats are still energized from the 2016 presidential election, in which Hillary Clinton carried Virginia but lost in the Electoral College to Donald Trump. “Trump’s election has really highlighted the importance of state legislatures.”</p>
<h3 class="c0169 c0163"><strong>Pro-Trump vs. Pro-Clinton localities</strong></h3>
<p class="c0169 c0163">Statewide in 2016, 50% of Virginia voters cast their ballots for Clinton and 44% for Trump. (The remaining votes went to the Libertarian and other minor-party candidates.)</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">Trump carried 93 cities and counties in Virginia, mostly in the less populated southern and western parts of the state where population has been flat or declining. Clinton carried 40 localities, largely in Northern Virginia, the Richmond area and Hampton Roads — areas that are more densely populated and generally are growing in population.</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">Last week, the Virginia Department of Elections posted data on how many people were registered to vote in each locality as of August. Capital News Service compared those numbers with the corresponding data for August 2015, when Virginia was preparing for a similar election in which only legislative and local offices were up for grabs.</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">During the four-year period, voter registration increased 6.4%, to 2.68 million, in the 93 localities that voted for Trump. But the number of voters jumped 8.6%, to 2.91 million, in the 40 localities that backed Clinton.</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">The difference was even bigger in the communities that went heavily for one candidate or another:</p>
<ul>
<li class="c0169 c0163">Seventy-six localities cast at least 55% of their votes for Trump. In those cities and counties combined, voter registration went up 5.8% over the past four years.</li>
<li class="c0169 c0163">Thirty localities cast at least 55% of their votes for Clinton. Taken as a whole, those areas have seen an 8.7% jump in registered voters since 2015.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="c0169 c0163"><strong>Will redrawn districts help Democrats?</strong></h3>
<p class="c0169 c0163">Stephen Farnsworth, director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington, noted that voter registration increased after 11 Virginia House districts were redrawn this year. That happened after the courts found that the districts had been racially gerrymandered. The redrawn districts generally are more favorable to Democrats.</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">“When lines are drawn more favorably for one party or the other, that increases the quality of the candidates who are willing to run, increases the amount of money that donors are willing to spend, and those two things can increase voter interest,” said Farnsworth, a political science professor. “Expect higher turnout in some of those newly drawn districts because they’re more competitive than they used to be.”</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">All seats in the General Assembly are up for election on Nov. 5. Currently, Republicans hold a 21-19 majority in the Virginia Senate and a 51-49 edge in the House of Delegates.</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">Ryer noted that the Senate has had the same districts drawn by the Democrats since 2011.</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">“The Senate is operating under a Democratic gerrymander,” Ryer said. “Yet, despite the fact that the Democrats drew the lines, Republicans have been in the majority since those lines went into effect.”</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">Democrats are hoping to flip both chambers so that they control not only state government’s executive branch, with Ralph Northam’s election as governor in 2017, but also the legislative branch.</p>
<p class="c0169 c0163">With control of the General Assembly at stake, Virginia’s legislative elections have attracted national attention. “People really look to Virginia as an indicator for how the rest of the nation will vote,” Gilley said.</p>

Gov. Justin Fairfax was surrounded by reporters inside the Capitol during the General Assembly session in February after sexual assault allegations against him surfaced. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>By Jeff Raines/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Lt. Gov Justin Fairfax has filed a $400 million defamation lawsuit against CBS for their reporting on sexual assault claims made against him. While defamation cases are common in the courtroom; winning one is not.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fairfax must prove CBS either knowingly reported false claims or intentionally did not investigate them, with specific intent to damage his reputation and political career.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Public figures &#8212; politicians, high-ranking government officials and celebrities, for instance &#8212; are required to prove actual malice to recover damages from defamatory statements.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Actual malice is a mindset that you mean to do something maliciously; it’s willful,” said Carl Tobias, a constitutional law expert and law professor at the University of Richmond.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> “It&#8217;s much worse than negligence. You blatantly fail to do something that causes somebody else a lot of harm,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fairfax, a lawyer, claims CBS aired false statements from Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson, two women who allege they were sexually assaulted by Fairfax 15 and 19 years ago, respectively.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lawsuit claims the network acted intentionally and &#8220;recklessly disregarded&#8221; attempts to verify the women&#8217;s claims by not running an independent investigation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tobias said “the case relies on allegations of what CBS failed to do.” Proving CBS acted negligently and did not thoroughly investigate the sexual assault claims is not enough to prove actual malice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lawsuit might contain plausible arguments, Tobias said, but that doesn’t mean it will hold up in the courtroom or be resolved anytime soon. CBS is probably going to fight the case, even if it ultimately settles later, Tobias said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fairfax has claimed his innocence since the beginning and said he had consensual encounters with both women. After the CBS interviews aired, Fairfax released the results of polygraph examinations that he said exonerate him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fairfax said the allegations made against him were a “political hit job” and that the timing was a “deliberate and calculated” effort to harm his career as he was poised to possibly ascend to the governorship. Gov. Ralph Northam was engulfed in a blackface scandal that erupted days before the Fairfax allegations, when a picture from Northam’s page in his medical school yearbook was released that showed a person in KKK garb and a person in blackface.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fairfax accused CBS of acting with actual malice by &#8220;hyping&#8221; the allegations and airing the interviews “to maximize ratings for CBS in light of the ongoing scandal” with the governor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fairfax also claims the network aired the interviews in an attempt to align with #MeToo victims after internal scandals rippled all the way up to CBS CEO Les Moonves, who was fired over sexual misconduct allegations. &#8220;CBS This Morning&#8221; co-anchor Charlie Rose was fired after eight women made sexual harassment allegations. &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; executive producer Jeff Fager left the network also in the face of sexual misconduct allegations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fairfax&#8217;s legal team concluded that &#8220;the network sought to visibly align itself on the side of perceived victims to improve its public image.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Watson and Tyson stand by their claims of sexual assault and offered in the spring to testify at the General Assembly, but legislators said criminal investigations should be held in states where the alleged assaults occurred. No criminal charges have been filed against Fairfax.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lawsuit also asks for an injunction that would stop the network from &#8220;disseminating, distributing, or publishing any footage or statements that are judicially determined to be defamatory.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">CBS said in a statement: &#8220;We stand by our reporting and we will vigorously defend this lawsuit.&#8221;</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>By Sravan Gannavarapu/ Capital News Service</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s poverty rate has fallen by a full percentage point, to about 10%, according to data released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The proportion of Virginians living in poverty dropped from 11.1% in 2015-16 to 10.1% in 2017-18, the <u><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.html" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1568241513279000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQzfdDM190D0uPGk_HbA81wSntSQ" target="_blank">data showed</a></u>. The state’s poverty rate remained well below the national rate, which averaged 12% for the most recent two-year period.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <u><a href="https://www.thecommonwealthinstitute.org/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.thecommonwealthinstitute.org&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1568241513279000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF11YhHT2YS9OgcVuc1lD6w3NcrfQ" target="_blank">Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis</a></u>, a nonprofit think tank, is pushing for public policies it hopes will ensure that poverty in Virginia continues to decline. For example, the group is urging the state government to reform how it funds public schools, said Laura Goren, the institute’s research director.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, we are working to make sure that children in poverty have proper education by making sure that the state funding formula is better,” Goren said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017-18, Virginia tied with Rhode Island for having the 14th lowest poverty rate among the 50 states and the District of Columbia, the Census Bureau reported.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">New Hampshire registered the lowest rate (6.6%) followed by Maryland and Utah at 7.8%. Louisiana, Mississippi and New Mexico had the nation’s highest poverty rates — almost 20%.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Poverty rates fells in Virginia and 40 other states as well as in Washington, D.C. In Tennessee, Delaware, Arizona and South Dakota, the rate fell by more than 3 percentage points.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Poverty rose in nine states. It went up the most (1.5 percentage points or more) in Nevada and Alaska, according to the Census Bureau.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Poverty status is based on <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1568241513279000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEs3GIRQCT0ZeYM69jMUkhg61N1tA" target="_blank">income level and family size</a>. In 2018, a person under 65 with an income less than $13,064 was considered poor. For a family of four including two children, the poverty cutoff was $25,465.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The poverty rates are estimates. They are based on surveys that have a margin of error.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Also Tuesday, the Census Bureau released data on the percentage of Americans who do not have health insurance. Nationwide, that percentage increased from 7.9% in 2017 to 8.5% in 2018.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats blamed Republicans for the increase, saying the Trump administration and GOP have dissuaded Americans from purchasing insurance under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks to the Trump Administration’s efforts to undermine the Affordable Care Act and eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions, the nation’s uninsured rate grew significantly for the first time this decade,” U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, <u><a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorDurbin/status/1171447206080962560" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/SenatorDurbin/status/1171447206080962560&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1568241513279000&amp;usg=AFQjCNETs1iscdifqEZfVsccmZiPOTBv0w" target="_blank">tweeted</a></u>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the percentage of residents without health insurance stayed the same at 8%. That number does not account for the expansion of Virginia’s Medicaid program, which began in January 2019.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Horses soon will race again at Colonial Downs, and Virginians will be able to bet on them and play slots-style machines in a casino-like setting at four other locations across the commonwealth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Colonial Downs Group will resume horse racing at its track in New Kent County and offer off-track betting at the other sites under the brand Rosie’s Gaming Emporium.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The New Kent County racetrack, between Richmond and Williamsburg, closed in 2014. Colonial Downs plans to resume horse racing there in August.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But before then, Virginians will have a chance to gamble — on historical horse racing gaming machines at the Rosie’s Gaming Emporium locations. The slots-style machines allow players to bet on horses from past races and also bet against other opponents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Colonial Downs Group is set to open a Rosie’s at the New Kent County track on April 23. The company will also open gaming parlors in Richmond, Hampton, Chesapeake and the Roanoke County town of Vinton by the end of 2019.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rosie’s will generate $25 million in state taxes annually and create 800 jobs statewide, according to Colonial Downs spokesman Mark Hubbard. The Richmond location will employ about 150 people and open in June.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mayor Levar Stoney has endorsed the venture, which will be in south-central Richmond.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve had tremendous support from Mayor Stoney and city leaders,” Hubbard said. “The community in the 9th District is excited about us opening soon, and we’re very excited about bringing a new form of entertainment and fun to Richmond.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The five Rosie’s facilities will include a total of 3,000 historical horse racing gaming machines. The bets feed into a collective pool that players can win, with various purses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The revenues that we generate through the machines will help fund purses at the race track and a portion of the revenues will go to the horse racing industry,” Hubbard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The collective purse falls under a type of gambling known as pari-mutuel betting. This type of gaming machine was created in Kentucky to revitalize the horse industry and generate revenue year-round, Hubbard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Using the machines, players select three horses (the winners of historical horse races), place a bet and then watch an animated re-enactment of the horses competing. The company calls the machines a “competitive substitute for traditional casino style games.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The launch of <a href="https://rosiesgaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://rosiesgaming.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1555097754217000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFcNzJM6qIybyMRlMHMFkCuRKxRrw">Rosie’s Gaming Emporium</a> coincides with a push in the General Assembly to allow casinos in the commonwealth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On March 21, Gov. Ralph Northam signed into law a bill that may eventually loosen the reins on casino gambling. <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191%2Bsum%2BSB1126&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1555097754217000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHd3sxLx7uYA33SLBFWQAOY0w54ZA">SB 1126</a>, sponsored by Sen. L. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, calls for a study of casino gaming in the state, which must be completed by Dec. 1.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Going forward, localities would be required to pass a referendum to allow casino gaming. The <a href="https://www.valottery.com/aboutus/leadership" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.valottery.com/aboutus/leadership&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1555097754218000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEP46IuDhsHdtKhzlzzMEX4lXtn6Q">Virginia Lottery Board</a> would regulate the casinos. The board cannot issue any gaming licenses before July 1, 2020.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new law also gives the <a href="http://www.vrc.virginia.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.vrc.virginia.gov/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1555097754218000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEW8QifamzbqQygVHJkYi-nacy5GA">Virginia Racing Commission</a> control of racing with pari-mutuel wagering.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Colonial Downs Group will participate in the study, Hubbard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some organizations are worried about a negative impact on communities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Virginia Council on Problem Gambling believes that more people will develop gambling-related problems when given more opportunities to gamble.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As our legislators seek to expand gambling in Virginia, they need to do so responsibly by first assessing the risks and rewards, which hopefully the gambling study the governor is calling for will in part provide, and also setting up safeguards to protect the public from harm,” said the council’s president, Carolyn Hawley.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Family Foundation, a nonprofit Christian organization, has similar reservations and also believes that crime increases near casinos. The Colonial Downs Group believes its gaming centers will improve quality of life and possibly decrease crime.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Rosie’s in Richmond will replace a vacant Kmart lot off Midlothian Turnpike near Chippenham Parkway. Police regularly patrol the area because of crime, Hubbard said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re going to add a lot of lighting, surveillance and people coming and going, which will deter criminals,” Hubbard said. “When you bring a fun, lively, very well-lit and secure entertainment facility, that disperses crime.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Descendants of those involved in the milestone Supreme Court decision preventing African Americans from becoming citizens will come together and share their story of reconciliation and repentance, 162 years after the decision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lynne Jackson and Charles Taney will speak at the Claude G. Perkins Living and Learning Center at Virginia Union University on Wednesday from 7 to 10 p.m.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jackson is the great-great-granddaughter of Dred Scott, who was denied citizenship by the Supreme Court. Taney is a descendant of Chief Justice Roger Taney, who denied Scott and all other African Americans citizenship <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/06/supreme-court-decides-dred-scott-case-march-6-1857-435658" target="_blank">with the 1857 decision</a>. The discussion will focus on the bond Jackson and Taney built and their hope to better the future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“While this is a personal reconciliation story, it is our hope that this event will also contribute to discussions on how to achieve greater action and racial equity systemically in the commonwealth,” Virginians for Reconciliation said in a press release.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginians for Reconciliation seeks to heal racial wounds through similar events.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to Virginians for Reconciliation, the Dred Scott Heritage Foundation, founded by Jackson, its current president, is organizing Wednesday’s event.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The foundation has set out to educate people about the impact of the Dred Scott decision and the struggles for freedom by Scott, and his wife, Harriet. In doing so, the foundation hopes people won’t “forget the struggle for freedom, citizenship and equality, with an eye towards helping to heal the wounds of the past,” according to its website.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The organizations are working alongside VUU and Virginia Commonwealth University to bring this free event to the public.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Discussion on Truth and Reconciliation will be moderated by Ted Ritter, an assistant professor at VUU. The doors will open at 6:30 p.m. for a three-hour discussion on Jackson and Taney’s transformative journey.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Drivers in Virginia would face penalties for using a phone behind the wheel under legislation that Gov. Ralph Northam has amended and sent to the General Assembly for approval.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The time has come for the commonwealth to implement an effective and fair law to combat distracted driving,” Northam said. “Too many families have lost loved ones as a result of a driver paying more attention to their phone than to their surroundings. This bill, as amended, will be a significant step forward in promoting traffic safety across the commonwealth.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The governor amended <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+cab+HC10208SB1768+BREFC" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191%2Bcab%2BHC10208SB1768%2BBREFC&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553733638466000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGIs9My99_s4sZH7tgM79EuowbvVA" target="_blank">SB 1768</a></u>, sponsored by Sen. Montgomery “Monty” Mason, D-Williamsburg.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As approved by the House and Senate last month, Mason’s bill would prevent drivers from holding a handheld personal communications device in highway work zones. Violators would face a mandatory $250 fine.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Northam announced Tuesday that he has revised the bill to extend beyond work zones and prohibit distracted driving on all Virginia roads.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly will consider the governor’s recommendation when lawmakers reconvene April 3.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Current Virginia law prohibits drivers from texting or emailing on the road; however, it is legal to hold a cellphone to check social media and make phone calls. Northam said curbing Virginia’s distracted driving death rates is a priority for his administration.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s traffic fatalities have risen every year since 2014,” Mason said. “Distracted driving caused by cellphone use — whether it’s dialing, texting or checking email — is clearly the reason. I’m proud to be a part of a safety measure that will undoubtedly save the lives of many Virginians.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The fight against distracted driving in Virginia is not a new battle for legislators.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During this past legislative session, two bills — <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1811" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191%2Bsum%2BHB1811&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553733638466000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_JpHdkiPgEoIBWRoqkBWuVkASBg" target="_blank">HB 1811</a></u>, sponsored by Del. Chris Collins, R-Frederick, and <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1341" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191%2Bsum%2BSB1341&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553733638466000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFW3sQRJe6_iZBAiPBQ_fGMFZHm1w" target="_blank">SB 1341,</a></u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+SB1341" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191%2Bsum%2BSB1341&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553733638466000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFW3sQRJe6_iZBAiPBQ_fGMFZHm1w" target="_blank"> introduced by </a>Sen. Richard Stuart, R-Stafford, — sought to make it illegal to drive while holding a cellphone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Both bills died <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/25/the-three-words-that-killed-hands-free-driving-legislation-in-virginia/" target="_blank">when a conference committee</a> could not agree on legislative language during the session’s final days.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In amending Mason’s legislation, Northam recommended that organizations such as DRIVE SMART Virginia and the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police develop resources for law enforcement agencies and the general public about the law against using a phone while driving.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The governor also wants to require annual reports on distracted driving violations and the demographics of motorists cited for such offenses.</p>
<p> “The governor’s amendments address concerns about disparate enforcement against drivers of color and will help ensure this measure is being enforced appropriately across the state,&#8221; said Del. Jeff Bourne, D-Richmond.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">April will be Virginia’s 13th year of recognizing Distracted Driving Awareness Month. According to the American Automobile Association, 131 people died in 2018 from distracted driving in Virginia. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that nine people die daily in the U.S. from roadway accidents involving a distracted driver.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Collins and Stuart both issued statements supporting Northam’s amendment to SB 1768.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We see too many traffic crashes and tragedies caused by distracted driving,” Collins said. “This is affecting everyone, from road workers to law enforcement officials and first responders trying to keep us safe, to highway workers who are maintaining and improving our roadways. It’s time for us to take action to protect those using our roads in order to save lives in the commonwealth.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stuart added, “It has come to the point where people are so totally engrossed in their phones that they are almost oblivious to the world around them. And that’s just a dangerous recipe on the highway.”</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">In response in part to the child sex abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, Virginia will have a new law on July 1 requiring priests, ministers, rabbis and other clergy members to report suspected cases of child abuse or neglect.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam has signed into law two bills — <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1659" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb1659&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553821017808000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEheswMAZz65D-L6tRgE7hla8gSvQ" target="_blank">HB 1659</a></u>, sponsored by Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, and <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1257" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dsb1257&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553821017808000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGUZi5FDerhn5ab-_DlAlH2hayeKQ" target="_blank">SB 1257</a></u>, introduced by Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel, R-Fauquier. The measures mandate that religious officials must report any suspected abuse to local law enforcement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The bills passed unanimously in the House and Senate last month.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Existing state law lists 18 categories of people who must report information to local authorities if they “have reason to suspect that a child is an abused or neglected child.” They include health-care providers, police officers, athletic coaches and teachers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new law will add a 19th category to the list of so-called mandatory reporters: “Any minister, priest, rabbi, imam, or duly accredited practitioner of any religious organization or denomination usually referred to as a church.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, the law will exempt clergy members from the reporting requirement when confidentiality is required by the religious organization, such as anything a priest hears during confession.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A minister who hears about possible child abuse while counseling a parishioner, for example, would not have to tell authorities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Delaney said she filed her bill after a church in her Northern Virginia district failed to act on a case of child abuse. She said 27 other states have laws making clergy mandatory reporters.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Members of the clergy are in a role of trust and authority and they should not be held to a different standard than every other professional whose duty it is to protect children,” <u><a href="http://www.karriedelaney.com/press/delegate-karrie-delaney-takes-silence-child-abuse-places-worship" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.karriedelaney.com/press/delegate-karrie-delaney-takes-silence-child-abuse-places-worship&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553821017808000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3RF-UBk4_ueU9OHD0rMmKqbtGfg" target="_blank">Delaney said</a></u>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Child abuse by clergy has been a national concern in recent years with disclosures that some Catholic priests had sexually abused children and their superiors had covered up the incidents.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Diocese of Richmond released the names of <u><a href="https://richmonddiocese.org/list/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmonddiocese.org/list/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553821017808000&amp;usg=AFQjCNETfxGlyDdwUeMdwK9B4WIJy4WyRQ" target="_blank">43 clergy members</a></u> who “have a credible and substantiated allegation of sexual abuse involving a minor.” The Diocese of Arlington released the names of <u><a href="https://www.arlingtondiocese.org/clergyabuselist/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.arlingtondiocese.org/clergyabuselist/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553821017808000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLentjCRG5u29XAWl5HHFhPx0u1g" target="_blank">16 such individuals</a></u>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Catholic Conference, which represents the two dioceses on matters of public policy, supported the legislation introduced by Delaney and Vogel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Grier Weeks, senior executive of the National Association to Protect Children, sees Virginia’s new law as a step toward change but also a reflection of how much work is left to do.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Any action is great, but you shouldn’t need laws for people to do the right thing — especially when protecting children,” Weeks said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Weeks warned parents that predators are usually those they trust most around their children, not strangers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Predators often seem friendly,” Weeks said. “It is important to stay vigilant.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Northam signed the legislation just days before the start of National Child Abuse Prevention Month on April 1.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To receive reports of sexual abuse of a minor by clergy, the Virginia State Police have a website, <u><a href="http://www.virginiaclergyhotline.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.virginiaclergyhotline.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553821017808000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG-Q8cbsy1Uqxu5VbA5xQQg4dfdnQ" target="_blank">www.virginiaclergyhotline.com</a></u>, and a toll-free hotline, 833-454-9064.

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental and consumer groups applauded Gov. Ralph Northam after he signed legislation this week that aims to protect water quality by cleaning up more than 27 million cubic yards of coal ash from unlined ponds in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Northam signed into law <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1355" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dsb1355&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553289919702000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEhpjmnhmR0UqLvRFr4ZAb1-JT8QQ" target="_blank">SB 1355</a></u>, sponsored by Sen. Frank Wagner, R-Virginia Beach, and <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2786" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb2786&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553289919702000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG9apUT3bL2drh0MeX_DuL4o4VAKw" target="_blank">HB 2786</a></u>, sponsored by Del. Riley Ingram, R-Hopewell. The legislation seeks to clean up coal ash sites in the city of Chesapeake and in Prince William, Chesterfield and Fluvanna counties.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The ash is the byproduct of coal-fired power plants operated by Dominion Energy. The law will require Dominion to move the coal ash to lined landfills or recycle it in a safe manner.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The potential risks to public health and water quality posed by unlined coal ash ponds in the commonwealth are far too great for us to continue with business as usual,” Northam said. “This historic, bipartisan effort sets a standard for what we can achieve when we work together, across party lines, in the best interest of all Virginians. I am proud to sign this legislation into law.”</p>
<p>The passage of the legislation represents years of pushing back at Dominion&#8217;s plans to cap the ponds in place from a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Sens. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I think this represents the first time Virginia has adopted environmental regulations that are more protective of the environment than federal law,” Surovell said. “This represents an important step forward for environmental protections in Virginia.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"> Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, said she was proud that “bipartisan hard work” produced the legislation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“At town halls and meetings with my constituents, I promised that I would fight for legislation to recycle coal ash into concrete and other materials and to excavate and remove the remainder of coal ash to lined landfills because it was the most effective way to protect public health and the environment,” Carroll Foy said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The cleanup is expected to cost several billion dollars. Under the new law, Dominion will be able to pass on the cost to its customers. As a result, state officials have estimated, the average monthly electric bill will increase by about $5.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Potomac Riverkeeper Network thanked Northam and state legislators for working across party lines to pass the legislation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“This legislation, which is a result of four years of persistent work by Potomac Riverkeeper Dean Naujoks and our Virginia partners, is an historic step to solve the serious and lingering pollution problem of legacy coal ash,” said Nancy Stoner, the network’s president.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She said that four years ago, Naujoks began testing water wells near some of Dominion’s coal ash ponds and discovered that lead and arsenic had contaminated nearby groundwater.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The dangers of coal ash, leaking into groundwater, drinking wells, our rivers and streams and ultimately the Chesapeake Bay, have long been documented, and we’re proud of our role in fixing the problem,” Naujoks said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kendyl Crawford, director of Virginia Interfaith Power &amp; Light, said the new law was a step in the right direction. But she said the state should have required Dominion to bear the cost of the cleanup.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It is long overdue that decades-old toxic coal ash is finally being addressed after having poisoned Virginia’s waterways. Removing millions of cubic yards of toxic material along waterways to safe, lined landfills is a step towards a healthier and more just state. Now, we have a moral responsibility to ensure that all coal ash, including that outside of the Chesapeake Bay watershed is safely recycled and disposed,” Crawford said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“While we applaud the signing of this legislation that cleans up coal ash, once again Dominion, one of our electric utility monopolies, has shown their influence by pushing the fiscal burden to fall on electricity consumers.”</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">If Civil War history is to be displayed across the American South, it must be portrayed fairly and accurately with an open dialogue about racial disparities in the region, the former mayor of New Orleans told Richmond’s mayor Tuesday.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu and Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney discussed the symbolism of monuments honoring Confederate figures at a forum attended by several dozen people at the Virginia Museum of History and Culture.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney, who is African-American, and Landrieu, who is white, said it’s important for local leaders to tackle social issues such as racism and to chart a path toward dismantling inequities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t want to put [New Orleans] back the way it was, because it wasn’t great the night before Katrina hit it,” Landrieu said. “I don’t want to create something new that nobody recognizes, because our history is important, but what I want to do is put it back like it was if we had gotten it right the first time.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When he became mayor of New Orleans in 2010, Landrieu inherited a city that had been struck by Hurricane Katrina five years earlier and was dealing with the BP oil spill, which started the previous month. Amid the city’s restoration process, he was faced with the unseemly racial past of the South, and the question of what part of history to preserve and what to lay to rest.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The vestiges of slavery remain to this day,” said Landrieu, who served as mayor until 2018. “We talk about slavery, but we don’t do it well.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2017, Landrieu delivered a speech on the removal of four Confederate monuments in New Orleans.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“These statues are not just stone and metal, they’re not just innocent remembrances of a benign history,” Landrieu said. “These monuments celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy: ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, ignoring the terror that it actually stood for.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In his speech two years ago and at Tuesday’s forum, Landrieu agreed with Stoney that the Confederate monuments send the wrong message and ignore the other side of the history of the South.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It immediately begs the question — why are there no slave ship monuments, no prominent markers on public land to remember the lynchings or the slave blocks; nothing to remember this long chapter of our lives of the pain, of sacrifice, of shame — all of it happening on the soil of New Orleans,” Landrieu said in 2017.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a part of his E Pluribus Unum<em> </em>initiative, Landrieu visited Richmond in hopes of “bringing people together across the American South around issues of race, equity and economic opportunity,” according to <u><a href="https://richmondvacitynews.blogspot.com/2019/03/mayor-stoney-former-new-orleans-mayor.html" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://richmondvacitynews.blogspot.com/2019/03/mayor-stoney-former-new-orleans-mayor.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1553120466340000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGpHgXB6VDwq6ap3o0r1NIYU7CZvA" target="_blank">Richmond city officials</a></u>. The Latin phrase “e pluribus unum” means “out of many, one&#8221; and appears on the Great Seal of the United States.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, Richmond residents and officials have had an ongoing, polarized debate about whether to remove Confederate monuments in the city that was once the Confederate capital.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney, who<a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/city-of-richmond/mayor-stoney-richmond-s-confederate-monuments-should-stay-with-context/article_b8cbb743-410f-520f-9197-2a58450d128a.html" target="_blank"> previously favored leaving the monuments in place</a> with additional context, said keeping reminders of the Confederacy only increases the economic and racial inequities that exist in Richmond.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“You see some people living paycheck to paycheck, and others are living like they’re on TV,” Stoney said. “There’s a Richmond. Then there’s an RVA.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney said a wide wealth disparity exists in the city. Booming areas like Carytown and the Fan District are generally more affluent, while families in neighborhoods like Jackson Ward struggle to make rent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We all have a different idea of what quality of life is, but we don’t see it across the border,” Stoney said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Landrieu called the wealth and racial gap in Richmond “a block away, but a world apart.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As Richmond’s shameful racial history seems to bleed into the present, Stoney said Confederate monuments do not help in bringing an already-divided Richmond together.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“These monuments say, ‘Look who’s still in charge, we are this high and you’re this low,’” Stoney said. “That’s not the Richmond that we are.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney and Landrieu said they both agree that the way to advance is to create an open and honest dialogue and to represent the South’s history accurately and inclusively.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re going to curate our history, curate all of it, and curate it honestly,” Landrieu said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney said political participation is a crucial part of paving the road to dismantling racial and social inequities.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we have more of an opportunity to participate than just voting. That’s a passive way,” Stoney said. “Democracy, to me, is you put good in, you get good out. If you put bad in, you get bad out.”</p>

<p>Animal welfare advocates cheered legislation passed during the 2019 General Assembly session which increased penalties for animal cruelty and mandated that pets receive more room to roam if tethered outside.</p>
<p>“Overall, this year’s General Assembly brought significant victories for Virginia’s dogs and cats,” said Matthew Gray of the Virginia Humane Society.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One of the standout bills was <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1604" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dsb1604&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552711555016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsEKK261q0M_UGY_AvuF2PcwQ_IQ" target="_blank">SB 1604</a></u>, also known as “Tommie’s Bill,” which increases the penalty for animal abuse from a misdemeanor to a Class 6 felony.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, gained local and national attention and support after a pit bull was intentionally set on fire in February at a Richmond park. The dog, Tommie, eventually died from his injuries.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">DeSteph’s bill and a companion measure in the House — <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB1874" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191%2Bsum%2BHB1874&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552711555016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFissiyD1l5rHPEhr3UuGarVjcWtw" target="_blank">HB 1874</a></u>, introduced by Del. Margaret Ransone, R-Westmoreland — easily passed both the House and Senate and now await the governor’s signature.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Robert Orrock, R-Caroline, successfully sponsored two animal-related bills:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1625+" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3DHB1625%2B&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552711555016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGJ6OumZGhyv6LWZRnVuUcroqlJxg" target="_blank">HB 1625</a></u> clarifies the definition of adequate shelter to protect an animal from heat or cold. The new definition says the shelter must be “properly shaded” during hot weather and have a windbreak during cold weather.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1626" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb1626&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552711555016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH6JyTkgM7TiSiDuWp_SIyoOG1J_w" target="_blank">HB 1626</a></u> gives animal control officers permission to confiscate any tethered cocks that are being used or suspected of being used for animal fighting.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Orrock also introduced <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1827" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhb1827&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552711555016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXj3lOuhNi91VO83wkfVwn8P_anw" target="_blank">HB 1827</a></u>, which said that animals tethered outside must have a tether four times the animal’s length or 15 feet long, whichever is greater. That bill cleared the House but was killed by a Senate committee.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Humane Society, Virginia remains in the top tier as it relates to state animal protection laws, but several animal rights activists say Virginia can do more. For example, state officials should address the issue of tethering, said Tabitha Treloar of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Lionell Spruill, D-Chesapeake, introduced a bill similar to Orrock’s tethering proposal in the Senate. <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1025" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dsb1025&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552711555016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZC-onzEwn4Qov-5IDOnYJSeDmFQ" target="_blank">SB 1025</a></u> passed after revisions and is on Gov. Ralph Northam’s desk.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It would require tether lengths to be at least three times the size of the animal or 10 feet long, whichever is greater. The bill would also prohibit adding weights to the end of the tether. Farm animals would be exempt from the tethering provisions.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Although the bill is not the big win animal activists hoped for, Treloar said it is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We think this is going to provide additional clarity to the animal control officers who are responsible for enforcing code around the state, and we are glad we could come to a compromise,” Treloar said.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Also during the legislative session that ended Feb. 24, the General Assembly passed <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1675" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dsb1675&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552711555016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvcR_amG97y2eIRRcrpwRw-xMxfA" target="_blank">SB 1675</a></u>, sponsored by Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Fredericksburg. It would mandate a minimum six-month imprisonment sentence for anyone who maliciously kills or injures any law enforcement animal. The punishment would be separate from and run consecutively with any other sentence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Animal testing was another issue brought up this session. Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, proposed <u><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1642" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dsb1642&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552711555016000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE0-C7gSzILrMpEZXl7Q_dYhmFCFw" target="_blank">SB 1642</a></u>, which sought to prohibit cosmetic manufacturers and suppliers from producing and selling any animal-tested cosmetics. This bill also would have authorized civil actions against violators, with penalties of up to $5,000.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Animal testing for cosmetics is cruel and unnecessary and is deeply unpopular with the public,” Boysko said. “My bill aimed to ensure that animals are not harmed for cosmetics sold in Virginia, thus meeting consumer demand, saving animals and helping the U.S. match global progress on this issue.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko’s bill passed the Senate, 22-18, but was killed in the House Committee on Agriculture, Chesapeake and Natural Resources.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Working in the trenches, side by side with people,” as Zann Nelson said, highlighted the beliefs her father instilled in her youth. Growing up in Culpeper County, Nelson said she learned of a deeper truth to American history, and her father reminded her that people should be seen through the lens of equality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Those experiences motivated her pursuit to make Virginia the first state to acknowledge the horrific crimes of the Jim Crow era.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nelson, a researcher and a columnist for the Culpeper Times, initiated a resolution that passed the General Assembly acknowledging with “profound regrets” the lynching of over 80 African-American men. Nelson is the former director of the History of Culpeper Museum, where her research began.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The culminating thing for me was when I took the position at the local museum and I could see first-hand histories were not being told,” Nelson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2005, a reporter contacted Nelson about the lynching decades earlier of an 18-year-old black man, Charles Allie Thompson of Culpeper. At that time, she said the only thing she had come across were two news articles published two days after Thompson’s murder.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I wanted to know more,” Nelson said. She spent the next 13 years investigating the 1918 lynching of Thompson, hoping to bring some reconciliation to his family.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Thirteen and a half years of perseverance is what got this resolution to pass,” Nelson said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nelson then worked with Culpeper Star-Exponent reporter Allison Brophy Champion on a series about the homicide and the various families affected. But she realized she needed to expand her scope.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I discussed with a friend &#8212; she brought it to my attention that I was just going after one person and encouraged me to look further into some kind of request,” said Nelson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nelson began emailing and visiting legislators. Nelson first reached out to Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, and Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Mount Solon. The legislators asked Nelson if she would be willing to draft a resolution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The resolution is more than a piece of paper and consists of directives that will encourage ongoing research and recognition: particularly in the form of the database and the collaboration with the (Virginia Department of Historic Resources) on a marker program,” Nelson said. “This is not the end, but rather the beginning of a long and overdue journey to truth and the hope of reconciliation.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nelson took her resolution draft to the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Commission, which helped her advance her resolution, by forming a work study group called the<a href="http://mlkcommission.dls.virginia.gov/lynchinginvirginia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://mlkcommission.dls.virginia.gov/lynchinginvirginia.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552030944980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFYVKCEn7PP18Y79sjZWZytqx2tQg"> History of Lynching in Virginia</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The resulting measures, <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hj655" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dhj655&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552030944980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFNOHKMRg0l9KL1P6NUM5cp8819ww">HJ 655</a> and <a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sj297" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses%3D191%26typ%3Dbil%26val%3Dsj297&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552030944980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH1XeoCCe8lWn3raZwlnqLg-L-RXw">SJ 297</a>, passed the General Assembly unanimously. The legislation calls “for reconciliation among all Virginians” regarding the racial terror, state-sanctioned segregation and discrimination faced by African-Americans during the Jim Crow years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the identical resolutions, the state will document the lynchings online and with historic markers. The goal is to bring awareness of Virginia’s lynching history, for “healing and reconciliation in Virginia’s still-wounded communities and for families and descendants affected by lynchings.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The resolutions note that more than 4,000 lynchings took place throughout the South between 1877 and 1950. At least 80 lynchings — some scholars say more than 100 — occurred in Virginia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After the legislation was passed, Nelson wrote an open letter to Thompson, who went by Allie, published in the Culpeper Times on Feb. 21. In her <a href="http://www.insidenova.com/culpeper/columnists/zann-s-place-a-letter-to-allie/article_bc59f5a6-35e1-11e9-bd45-5fe240b60950.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=user-share&amp;fbclid=IwAR2vWliC6R-UPowDfzqovYOAGzVy8sUHk2QK235rj6aoRX86SpMIgPXQQiI" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.insidenova.com/culpeper/columnists/zann-s-place-a-letter-to-allie/article_bc59f5a6-35e1-11e9-bd45-5fe240b60950.html?utm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_campaign%3Duser-share%26fbclid%3DIwAR2vWliC6R-UPowDfzqovYOAGzVy8sUHk2QK235rj6aoRX86SpMIgPXQQiI&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1552030944980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG6BHvxBp0Dln5h9GN1M10RIhAUHA">letter,</a> Nelson details the process for getting the resolutions passed and the importance of Thompson’s legacy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Allie, I assure you it is not just lip-service to the shameful past,” Nelson wrote in her letter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In closing please allow me to thank you. You may think that your loss of life was for nothing, but you would be wrong. Allie, it is because of you that this historic piece of legislation has come to pass: the first for any state in the United States.”</p>
