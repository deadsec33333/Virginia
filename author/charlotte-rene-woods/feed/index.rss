<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clarissa McGhee, a janitor at the Marshall Plaza municipal building, says she intermittently uses a cane due to arthritis but has never let it interfere with her work — until she allegedly stopped receiving shifts. According to McGhee, Nu-Tech manager Russell Dandridge told her, “don’t come with a cane.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My heart just dropped,” McGhee said in a phone interview with The Mercury. “I’m like, what does my cane have to do with me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGhee described her cane as a necessary aid she occasionally relies on but insisted that it doesn’t hinder her ability to perform her job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a part of me,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By early November,Nu-Tech instructed McGhee to clock out of a shift and return with a doctor’s note. After obtaining the note, McGhee brought it to the company the following week but was still sent home and allegedly told that her cane was “a liability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGhee has since filed a </span><a href="https://www.seiu32bj.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/12-17-2024-McGhee-EEOC-Complaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complaint </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, citing violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. She also joined her colleague, Sharonda Smith, in a separate complaint filed with the National Labor Relations Board alleging retaliation for union activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith said that the two women had posted a flier to generate interest in forming a union. Shortly after, she was informed in November that her position had been terminated in November — a move she believes was linked to her union involvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Service Employees International Union’s regional chapter filed the </span><a href="https://www.seiu32bj.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/12-18-2024-Nu-Tech-ULP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">labor complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on their behalf and </span><a href="https://x.com/32BJSEIU/status/1869828304141988121" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the action during a rally outside Richmond City Hall on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the rally, Smith shared her struggles since losing her job. A diabetic, she expressed concern about affording medical supplies not fully covered by Medicare and about keeping a roof over her family’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I expect to get eviction notices from the hotel where my family and I live because we can’t afford anything else,” Smith said. “I have to go to charities and food banks, but I shouldn’t have to do this because I enjoyed my job and I want work!”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin presents his proposed amendments to the state's biennial budget before a joint meeting of the Virginia General Assembly's money committees in Richmond on Wednesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the third consecutive year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposed budget includes language seeking to eliminate state-funded abortions for severe fetal anomalies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title32.1/chapter3/section32.1-92.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> currently allows state insurance to cover abortions if a physician certifies that a fetus would be born with a “gross and totally incapacitating physical deformity or with a gross and totally incapacitating mental deficiency.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diagnoses like anencephaly, where a fetus’ skull and brain fail to fully develop, fall under this category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposed </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2025/1/HB1600/Introduced/4/4-5.04/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strike language permitting state coverage for such procedures. The bill reads that “no expenditures from general or non-general fund sources may be made out of any appropriation by the General Assembly for providing abortion services, except otherwise as required by federal law or state statute,” with the state-funded exception removed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendment has failed in past budget negotiations as the legislature was split between Democratic and Republican control. With Democrats now holding a majority in both chambers, the proposal faces even steeper opposition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, Youngkin has continued to reintroduce the measure, aiming to reduce public funding spent on these abortions. Over the past four years, 121 state-funded abortions for severe fetal anomalies have been performed, according to the </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/38/2024/10/SFA_summary_GA25_SFY2020_2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2020, two procedures cost the state about $5,000, while in 2024, 36 procedures cost approximately $61,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia Director Jamie Lockhart called Youngkin’s budget language “discriminatory” and “cruel.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People facing complex and heartbreaking situations, such as a severe fetal diagnosis, deserve compassion, support, and access to necessary abortion care — not stigma and funding barriers that put this care out of reach,” Lockhart said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lockhart emphasized that the proposal would disproportionately affect low-income Virginians who rely on state coverage to navigate and and afford their pregnancies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many fetal anomalies not diagnosed until around or after </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she added that the policy would target families already grieving over the devastating realities of a wanted pregnancy gone awry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Youngkin’s administration defended the proposal as part of his broader budget focus on maternal health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin announced significant new maternal health initiatives this week that will continue to promote a culture of life in the commonwealth, including not forcing Virginia taxpayers to subsidize abortions except where it is required by federal law,” spokesperson Christian Martinez said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-unveils-plan-to-improve-maternal-health-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over $4 million in investments for pilot programs and efforts to expand the maternal healthcare workforces. Similarly, Democratic lawmakers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  a “momnibus” package of legislative and budget proposals aimed at improving maternal  health outcomes and providing support for parents-to-be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite potential agreement on maternal health initiatives, Youngkin’s abortion proposal faces stiff resistance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democrats are also advancing a proposed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enshrine abortion rights in Virginia’s Constitution. The amendment would need to pass in 2025 and 2026 legislative sessions before being placed on a statewide ballot for voter approval. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin presents his proposed amendments to the state's biennial budget before a joint meeting of the Virginia General Assembly's money committees in Richmond on Wednesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the cusp of his last full year in office, Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping budget proposal that he hopes will define his legacy as Virginia’s 74th governor. Focused on tax cuts, infrastructure, education, and public health, the plan sets the stage for what could be a high-stakes 2025 legislative session as lawmakers weigh his ambitious priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We reopened Virginia’s economy after a global pandemic all while delivering surplus after surplus,” Youngkin said during a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees in Richmond. “Virginia is growing, Virginia is leading, and Virginia is winning. And this morning I ask you to join me in continuing that work together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized the state’s strong economic performance, pointing to job growth, corporate investment, and robust revenue increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The stock market is strong, and the Federal Reserve appears poised to reduce interest rates over the next year,” he said. “This backdrop further supports Virginia’s ongoing strong performance, with year-to-date revenues up 7.3% over 2024.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlighting more than $5 billion in tax cuts already delivered to Virginians over the last three years, Youngkin proposed additional measures to lower the cost of living. “Together, the commonwealth can make a clear statement that reducing tax burdens so Virginians can keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets is not a Republican idea, it’s not a Democrat idea, it’s just common sense,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cornerstone in Youngkin’s proposed revisions to the two-year budget is a renewed push to eliminate the locally imposed personal car tax, an issue that he first came to embrace earlier this year after two Democrats campaigning for legislative seats in Southwest Virginia </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/10/13/two-virginia-democrats-embrace-a-former-republican-governors-signature-policy-eliminate-the-car-tax/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of their platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car tax has been a Republican rallying point since 1997, when GOP gubernatorial nominee Jim Gilmore successfully campaigned on repealing the unpopular levy. However, without a clear plan during the 2024 legislative session, the proposal quickly fizzled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, Youngkin once again urged the General Assembly to abolish what he called Virginia’s “most hated tax since the tax on tea” that he said cost the average Virginia family of four about $290 annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Standing here today, I will renew my call for us to work to fully eliminate the car tax, but recognizing that this might not be possible in this short session, there is an incremental step that we should take together to provide additional car tax relief,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new proposal, the state would deposit $1.1 billion into a car tax credit fund to provide income tax rebates to nearly 1.9 million taxpayers earning up to $50,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals or $100,000 for couples filing jointly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible taxpayers would receive up to $150 for individual returns or $300 for joint returns annually for the next three years. After the fund is exhausted, the state would see a permanent reduction of $360 million in tax revenues each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also is asking the legislature to extend the standard deductions for state income tax returns — currently set at  $8,500 for individuals and $17,000 for joint filers — that are set to expire at the end of next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to make the standard deduction permanent before Jan. 1, 2026, would result in tax increases of $57 million in fiscal year 2026 and $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2027, the governor said. “My friends, there is no reason to raise taxes on Virginians. We are running surplus after surplus after surplus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers responded cautiously to Youngkin’s budget plan Wednesday, emphasizing the need to review the details before committing to any initiatives. With the legislative session set to begin in January, both the House and Senate are preparing to roll out their own budget amendment proposals, signaling potential negotiations ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our focus will remain on targeted investments that benefit all Virginians,” said House Appropriations Chair Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William. “We will explore how we can work across the aisle to ensure K-12 schools are fully funded, higher education is accessible, and affordable housing becomes a reality for more families. These are areas where we can and should find common ground.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, in a statement thanked Youngkin for presenting his budget and for “initiating this important conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, our responsibility is to evaluate these proposals thoughtfully and collaboratively to ensure they reflect the priorities of all Virginians. We can craft a budget that strengthens our schools, supports our communities, and provides real solutions for working families,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate’s president pro tempore, said that while her chamber will consider his proposal, the Democrats’ amendments will look different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Senate budget will provide relief to working families and individuals and invest in their education and well-being, while maintaining the commonwealth&#8217;s long-term fiscal health,” Lucas said. “Here in the Senate, we look beyond elections and talk-show appearances and budget for the long-haul.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other key initiatives in Youngkin’s proposed budget amendments:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘No tax on tips’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration is also proposing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/16/youngkin-pitches-tax-relief-for-tipped-workers-in-budget-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to eliminate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state taxes on tips for service industry workers, a policy similar to one championed by President-elect Donald Trump. If approved, the measure would allow tipped workers to claim a deduction on their state tax returns, with compliance monitored through IRS data and employer-reported W-2 forms. The proposal could benefit an estimated 250,000 Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has an incredible hospitality, restaurant and service industry, and hardworking Virginians should keep every penny of the tips they earn through their exceptional service. My proposal is very simple — no more taxes on tips,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the move is being framed as a win for workers, its broader implications remain unclear. Economists warn that some employers might exploit the policy by shifting more of a worker’s compensation to tips rather than wages, a concern </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-and-harris-say-theyll-kill-taxes-on-tips-how-would-that-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also raised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around similar federal legislation. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is proposing nearly $1 billion in new education funding, including a $50-million Virginia Opportunity Scholarship Program to provide $5,000 annual grants for private school expenses like tuition and transportation. About 10,000 K-12 students from families earning up to twice the federal poverty limit to qualify for free school meals would qualify, with funding coming from revenue growth, not existing education budgets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan includes $25 million for lab school partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities and nearly $500 for higher education capital projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is no new funding for college operating expenses, and Youngkin is pushing for a 2.5% cap on tuition increases. “It’s time for our colleges to cut administrative bloat and handle costs without asking taxpayers for more,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional proposals include $290 million for school construction, $550 million in direct aid, $6.8 million for school resource officers, and $50 million to support underperforming schools. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">VMSDEP</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/jlarc-review-of-vmsdep-no-evidence-of-peak-or-decline-in-participation-levels/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(VMSDEP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides tuition waivers to spouses and children of military members killed or permanently disabled in service, would receive $60 million from a surplus in the state’s 529 college savings program to address a funding shortfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers scrutinized the program last year after it was initially excluded from budget negotiations. Concerns over its sustainability arose as participation surged by nearly 350%, growing from about 1,400 participants in 2019 to about 6,400 in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allocation would come without any new policy proposals.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Withholding funds to quash ‘sanctuary cities’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin further echored national Republican rhetoric by declaring that “every state has become a border state” as he unveiled plans to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-wants-to-restrict-funding-for-localities-that-dont-comply-with-immigration-enforcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to localities that limit or refuse compliance with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal aligns with a broader GOP push against “sanctuary city” policies, which vary but often involve local governments choosing not to inquire about immigration status or declining full cooperation with ICE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Virginia’s legislature under Democratic control, this proposal is expected to face significant opposition during the upcoming budget negotiations.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boosting maternal health outcomes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Democratic lawmakers are prioritizing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their legislative and budget </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/17/in-bipartisan-push-virginia-lawmakers-target-rural-healthcare-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increasing the chances that some measures will make it through budget negotiations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s plan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-unveils-plan-to-improve-maternal-health-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes $2.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for perinatal health hubs, expanded funding for OB-GYN residencies, and a $500,000 education campaign to help parents recognize life threatening conditions like heart attacks or eclampsia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also proposes $1 million to support workforce development for midwives and doulas, both crucial professions in addressing care gaps and advocating for patients, particularly those of color impacted by racial health disparities. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mental health support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia enters its third year of its Right Help, Right Now initiative, Youngkin’s latest budget request includes </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/meet-people-where-they-are-special-teams-aid-va-s-efforts-to-expand-mental-health-care-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$35 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve crisis response involving law enforcement. The funding would support hiring </span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/licensure-and-regulatory-affairs/special-conservators-peace" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special conservators of the peace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or “s-cops,” as Youngkin calls them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These intermediaries would assist with individuals awaiting hospital admissions after mental health crises, aiming to de-escalate situations where people in crisis might unintentionally harm  officers and face jail time. Youngkin envisions the “s-cops” fostering better outcomes for those in crisis while allowing law enforcement officers to focus on their regular duties.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disaster relief</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration proposes allocating $127 million toward a permanent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disaster relief fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to aid victims of natural disasters beyond what the federal assistance, insurance and private donations cover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southwest Virginia has faced repeated flooding in recent years, most recently from Hurricane Helene in September, which claimed three lives and caused $4.4 billion in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/va-dept-of-transportation-estimates-hurricane-helene-debris-cleanup-will-take-3-to-6-months/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Youngkin said $25 million could come from the general fund, with $102 million sourced from the latest round of revenues of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had previously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/20/judge-deems-youngkins-actions-to-withdraw-virginia-from-rggi-unlawful/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sought to withdraw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia from RGGI, despite praise from environmental groups for its funding for flood resilience and energy efficiency programs. “I fully expect that the General Assembly will work constructively together in this next short session to appropriate funds specifically for Hurricane Helene relief,” he said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, questioned the governor’s proposal, pointing to his approach of using RGGI revenues. “Why not just put us back in RGGI?” she asked, while noting uncertainty about the fund’s legislative support.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t know yet,” she said in an interview. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jasmine Storrs took the stage Tuesday, she didn’t hold back: She nearly died after childbirth because she ignored her body’s warning signs. Now, she wants other women to listen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storrs, who suffered a heart attack after days of chest tightness, shared her harrowing experience before Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced a slate of investments aimed at improving maternal health outcomes in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time is muscle,” she recalled her doctor saying before nine hours of open-heart surgery — words that saved her life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message was echoed by Sen. Emily Jordan, R-Suffolk, who ignored eclampsia signs after the birth of her third child in September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a lot of women feel guilty going through the birthing process or pregnancy process because they have other responsibilities,” Jordan said. “We have to be empowered to ask the right questions at the right time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both women joined Youngkin who wants to invest $2.5 million in perinatal health hub pilot programs, $1 million to expand support for doulas and community health workers in local health districts, $500,000 for a public awareness campaign on life-threatening pregnancy complications, and additional funding for OB-GYN and psychiatric medical residencies in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals are part of Youngkin’s broader budget request, which he will present to the state legislature’s finance committees on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visibly emotional during the announcement, Youngkin reflected on his mother’s career as an OB-GYN nurse practitioner, calling the moment a “chance to speak for her.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also issued an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/ED-11---Maternal-Health-FINAL-12.17.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state health department to include pregnancy-related data on its Maternal and Child Health Data dashboard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s latest efforts  build on previous work to strengthen  maternal health, including his support for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health hubs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Petersburg and signing a bill earlier this year  requiring health insurance </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coverage for doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s announcement comes as Democrats prepare their own push to address maternal disparities through a comprehensive “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">momnibus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” package of bills and budget proposals — a riff on the term omnibus.  The effort follows an October summit in Richmond that brought together lawmakers and medical experts to tackle maternal health challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan rural healthcare committee has also highlighted maternal health gaps in its legislative recommendations following a statewide tour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2025 legislative session set to convene on Jan. 8, improving maternal healthcare is emerging as a shared priority, offering a rare opportunity for bipartisan action in Richmond.  </span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="768" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240916_155028-1024x768.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240916_155028-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240916_155028-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240916_155028-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240916_155028-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240916_155028-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Blacksburg-area pharmacist Jeremy Counts, pictured on the projector screen, called in to the Sept. 16 meeting of the state's rural health care committee to talk about challenges independent pharmacies face. He highlighted that these pharmacists will serve the areas of the state that national chains sometimes won’t. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers criss-crossing rural Virginia this year heard a common refrain: Rural communities are struggling with healthcare workforce shortages and transportation challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After months of meetings and site visits, the bipartisan  House Select Committee on Advancing Rural and Small Town Health Care on Tuesday released its report with a slate of legislative and budgetary recommendations aimed at tackling those challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the proposals are state-funded grants to help rural healthcare providers recruit professionals and increased investments in nursing education programs to build a stronger workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve transportation access, the report proposes  a new program to provide rides to free clinics and federally qualified health centers. Lawmakers point to Virginia’s existing non-emergency transportation program for Medicaid patients, run by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, as a potential model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got something that’s at least serving some people,” Committee Chair Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, said during a September meeting on the Eastern Shore. “Can we leverage that? Is there a way to expand that for non-Medicaid folks who have certain income levels or live in certain areas? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also recommends requiring insurers to cover audio-only telehealth services. Willett previously told The Mercury that it would be a lifeline for people with limited broadband access, as well as older patients or those without computers who rely on phones for remote medical care.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Support for rural parents-to-be</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key section of the report focuses on maternal healthcare, aligning with a recently announced “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">momnibus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” package of bills and budget proposals from Democratic lawmakers. Gov. Glenn Youngkin has also outlined his own plans to address maternal health, setting the stage for a bipartisan push in the 2025 legislative session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With about 30% of Virginians living in areas with limited or no maternity care services, rural patients are often forced to travel long distances  for care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midwives have become essential in filling these maternal care gaps providing perinatal care in homes, birth centers and rural hospitals. To bolster this workforce, the report recommends increased Medicaid reimbursement rates for midwives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midwives are often rooted in the communities they serve and more likely to stay, compared to some OB-GYN medical residents that may work in rural areas for a time before leaving for work elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Youngkin has committed to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuing funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for OB-GYN and family practice medical residencies — which are critical as rural hospitals close obstetrics units — the report calls for broader investment in medical residencies statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Youngkin on Tuesday announced his support for legislation to streamline out-of-state midwives seeking to practice in Virginia, further strengthening the maternal health workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report further recommends boosting funding for community college doula training programs, recognizing the critical role doulas play in supporting parents-to-be and improving health outcomes. This support is especially impactful for patients of color, who face disproportionate risks during pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black women are significantly </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to die </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from pregnancy complications when compared to white women. Studies point to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a contributing factor to poorer health outcomes for women of color, where doulas have been key advocates for patients’ needs and care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Youngkin signed a bill supporting health insurance </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coverage for doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, acknowledging their role in maternal health. But he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a separate measure that would have required unconscious bias training for nursing license renewals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bias training remains a key recommendation from the rural health committee, though it has faced resistance from some Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee member Del. Otto Wachsmann, R-Sussex, clarified the hesitation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem isn’t that Republicans are against cultural awareness training — I think everybody is really for that —  but it’s putting another burden on the providers,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the day, when Youngkin outlined maternal health policies that he supports, The Mercury asked what changes might make him reconsider the unconscious bias bill if reintroduced, he acknowledged the disparities in health outcomes for patients of color compared to white patients, but didn&#8217;t specify if he would support the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the right way to address it is to use the data that we gather and analyze to put forth really specific initiatives,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin was referring to an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/ED-11---Maternal-Health-FINAL-12.17.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s health department to include pregnancy-related data on its Maternal and Child Health Data dashboard.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Looking forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lawmakers discussed the recommendations from their report, many reflected on the bipartisan companionship built during their work on the committee — a spirit of collaboration they hope to carry into the 2025 session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These were overnight trips,” Wachsmann said. “We found a lot of camaraderie together just breaking bread at the table and spending time together.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representing a rural district, Wachsmann has firsthand experience with the challenges highlighted in the report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve watched as our areas have lost pharmacies,” Wachsmann said. “I’ve seen our grocery stores leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that it was “refreshing” to see lawmakers  from both rural and urban districts come together to focus on the unique struggles facing  rural communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willett, the committee chair, emphasized that while the proposals aren’t a complete solution, they represent important steps toward improving healthcare access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if all of the committee’s roughly 30 proposals are eventually adopted, Willett said  that rural healthcare issues won’t “go away” overnight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can speak for all of us here in saying that we’re committed to staying on the case and making that progress,” he said. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s top investigatory body is turning its attention to Red Onion State Prison following alarming reports of self-harm and poor conditions at the supermax facility in Wise County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Sapone, the state’s new corrections ombudsman, announced Monday that her office will prioritize an investigation into living conditions and the health and safety of incarcerated individuals at the prison, which has faced scrutiny after a hunger strike in 2023 and six cases of people burning themselves this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Office of the State Inspector General takes all allegations of abuse seriously,” she told the House of Delegates’ Public Safety Committee. “A Red Onion investigation will be prioritized as soon as we have full staff to do it properly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An offer has been extended for one position, and a pool of candidates is under consideration to fill four more roles, an OSIG spokesperson confirmed to The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calls for oversight at Red Onion have grown louder from prison reform advocates, lawmakers and families of incarcerated individuals. Allegations against the facility include poor living conditions, mistreatment and the extended  use of solitary confinement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a presentation to the committee on Monday, Department of Corrections director Chad Dotson suggested the recent incidents of self-harm were attempts by inmates to secure transfers to other prisons closer to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no evidence whatsoever that there was any kind of a plot or a protest,” Dotson said. “All the inmates involved said they did it because they wanted to get away from Red Onion. Two of these have a history of self-harm.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Taj Mahon-Haft, founder of the Humanization Project, pushed back, emphasizing that the underlying issue is the level of desperation that drives people to harm themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft, who was formerly incarcerated, said he understands firsthand the challenges of imprisonment, particularly how prolonged isolation can lead to harmful thoughts or actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">April Wright shared a harrowing account during the meeting, revealing that her incarcerated son had apparently attempted to hang himself. Wright said she only learned of the incident when another inmate reached out to inform her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of solitary confinement, or what Virginia calls “restorative housing,”  was another major focus of the discussion. Under a state law enacted last year, incarcerated individuals in restorative housing are now granted four hours a day outside their cells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson described the practice as a temporary measure, explaining that it is reserved for individuals with serious behavioral infractions who may pose a threat to themselves or others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in a </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/press-releases/hundreds-virginians-held-prolonged-solitary-confinement-join-aclu-virginia-class#:~:text=%E2%80%93%20A%20federal%20judge%20in%20the,Department%20of%20Corrections%20(VADOC)." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) allege they were placed in confined housing for extended periods, with at least one person claiming the experience left them feeling suicidal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s clear that this is a systemic problem,” ACLU attorney Geri Greenspan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the General Assembly passed a </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB719" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">aimed at further reforming confinement practices in Virginia prisons, but it was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. While it remains unclear if a similar bill will be introduced in the upcoming legislative session, members of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus have hinted at the possibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, is looking forward to a formal investigation into Red Onion State Prison. 	<div class="halfwidth">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the most important thing we heard was the commitment from the ombudsman to make this investigation into Red Onion her top priority,” Simon said. “I think that&#8217;s a win.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers are gearing up for a renewed push to tackle maternal health disparities in the 2025 session, with a slate of bills and budget amendments focused on improving outcomes for parents across the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key proposal is a bipartisan effort to mandate </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-black-maternal-health-carroll-foy-youngkin/article_4608fd84-d1ae-11ee-8379-138efdfc34c7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unconscious bias training</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for nursing license renewals, which previously passed the legislature but </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers say that targeted training is critical in addressing preventable deaths and complications during childbirth, marking it as a vital step in the broader push for maternal health reform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals a stark disparity in maternal health: Black women are significantly </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to die</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from pregnancy-related complications than white women. Research also highlights that women of color often face worse  health outcomes, partly due to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in healthcare settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, emphasized the urgency of addressing these inequities, stating that the proposed legislation aims to tackle the “broken systems and lack of resources” contributing to poor maternal health outcomes, particularly for Black parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “momnibus” package — a play on the term omnibus — also includes proposals to enhance healthcare monitoring and expanded Medicaid coverage to improve maternal health outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key initiative by Del. Amy Laufer, D-Charlottesville, seeks to pilot remote monitoring for conditions like hypertension and diabetes. This approach is designed to assist expectant parents, particularly those in rural areas with limited access to hospitals or healthcare providers, by ensuring their conditions are closely monitored during pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 30% of Virginia counties lack a birthing center within a 30-minute drive, according to the March of Dimes, a non-profit that works to enhance the health of mothers and babies. In Southwest and Southside Virginia, recent years have seen the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closure of several obstetrics units</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, the latest state budget includes funding to support OB-GYN residencies in hospitals, aiming to bolster care in underserved areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The momnibus package also includes proposals to expand Medicaid coverage to include diapers and limited baby supplies, as well as legislation to establish a women’s health commission focused on developing targeted maternal health policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and maternal health experts first previewed the momnibus package during a Black Maternal Health </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/18/momnibus-bill-plans-announced-at-virginias-black-maternal-health-summit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Richmond in October, where public health professionals and legislators from around the country gathered to collaborate on solutions to improve maternal health outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, on Monday expressed optimism about bipartisan support for the upcoming maternal health proposals, noting that Republicans have previously supported and even co-sponsored some Democrat-led maternal health initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re hoping that when these bills get before them, they will continue that support,” Mundon King said.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin serves coffee to patrons at McLean's Restaurant in Richmond after announcing a "no-tax-on-tips" budget proposal on Dec. 16, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin served more than pancakes and coffee at McLean’s Restaurant in Richmond Monday morning. He also unveiled another key part of his budget proposal: eliminating state taxes on tipped employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describing the measure as a “foundational piece” of his budget, which he is expected to present before a joint meeting of the legislature’s money committees on Wednesday, Youngkin emphasized the need to ease financial pressures, stating “It is time for us to reduce tax burdens on hard working Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 250,000 people working in food service and hospitality could see tax relief under the plan, according to the Virginia Department of Taxation and the Virginia Employment Commission. Tipped workers would be able to claim a deduction on their state tax returns, with compliance ensured through IRS data and employer-reported W-2 information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal must still get approval from the General Assembly as lawmakers and the governor work toward an amended biennial state budget during the upcoming legislative session, which begins in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is running for governor in 2025 and joined Youngkin at the announcement, expressed optimism about the policy, suggesting that Virginia could be the first state to implement such a measure if approved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think this should be bipartisan,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the leading Democrat in the state Senate who chairs the finance committee, did not have a comment at the time of this publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s push to eliminate state taxes on tips mirrors discussions at the federal level, where the idea gained traction during the fall campaign season. Both President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris floated similar proposals, and </span><a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/08/13/horsford-announces-bill-to-make-sure-high-end-earners-cant-exploit-an-end-to-tax-on-tips/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">related bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been introduced </span><a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/legislative-documents/proposed-legislation/s-4621-no-tax-tips-act/7kgn8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Congress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While eliminating taxes on tips might seem like a clear win for workers, the policy’s broader impact remains uncertain. Economists have raised concerns that some employers could exploit the measure by shifting more of a worker’s compensation to tips rather than wages, a possibility also </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-and-harris-say-theyll-kill-taxes-on-tips-how-would-that-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as similar  national legislation has been filed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about this concern, Youngkin acknowledged variations across the food service industry. “It depends, of course, on the establishment,” he said. “But, we see a substantial portion of our waiters and waitresses earnings in the form of tips, and this is a great way for us to say that ‘You keep that money.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the preview of his upcoming budget presentation on Wednesday, Youngkin also announced </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-wants-to-restrict-funding-for-localities-that-dont-comply-with-immigration-enforcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cut funding to localities that limit or refuse compliance with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal aligns with a broader GOP-led national movement to counter “sanctuary city” policies. These policies vary but often involve local governments opting not to ask about an individual&#8217;s immigration status or refusing to fully cooperate with ICE. However, with Virginia’s legislature under Democratic control, the proposal is likely to face significant resistance during the upcoming budget negotiations. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hired in late September by the Office of the State Inspector General, Sapone said her office has already begun tracking letters and emails from those seeking assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It takes a village to raise and identify concerns and find solutions,” Sapone told members of Virginia’s Corrections Oversight Committee Friday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Office of the State Inspector General (OSIG) plans to improve transparency and accessibility for its corrections ombudsman unit by updating its website to include the unit’s mailing address and an online complaint form,Sapone said. She added that she is working on protocol to ensure that inmates and family members who reach out can be informed about the status of investigated claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sapone also called for a formal memorandum of understanding between OSIG and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Department of Corrections to establish coordination procedures for investigations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Alexandria, a member of the Corrections Oversight Committee, said that he and other lawmakers are frequently  contacted by incarcerated people and their families seeking assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasized that while it may be tempting for lawmakers to intervene directly in complaints it is crucial to forward the information to the ombudsman to ensure a proper investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know, you hear compelling stories that may or may not be true and we need to regulate ourselves to make sure that our role is to oversee the ombudsman’s office and not get engaged in individual cases,” Marsden said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">People in Red Onion State Prison relay poor conditions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An investigation into living conditions and treatment of inmates at Red Onion State Prison is what some lawmakers, prison reform advocates and loved ones of people incarcerated there have been calling for in recent weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of Thanksgiving, Department of Corrections Director Chad Dotson confirmed that six incarcerated individuals had intentionally </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-department-of-corrections-confirm-inmates-burned-themselves-lawmakers-want-investigation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">burned themselves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He said that they received medical treatment and were referred to mental health services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The confirmation came after the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus (VLBC) urged Dotson and Gov. Glenn Youngkin to investigate. The caucus, which had been contacted by families of those incarcerated, suggested the self-harm incidents were acts of protests against prison conditions or efforts to prompt transfers to other facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Red Onion has also seen hunger strikes, with inmates citing  poor living conditions and food, mistreatment,racism by some correctional officers and the excessive use of solitary confinement, according to the caucus </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, the caucus said the hunger strike and the self-harm “reflect the psychological and physical toll that gruesome prison conditions can have on incarcerated individuals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Dotson confirmed that at least six people at the prison had harmed themselves, he said they did so by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“tampering with electrical outlets.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson dismissed reports from the prison as “bad-faith efforts to try to score cheap political points by advocacy groups.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also accused these groups of pushing for “prison abolition and policies that would make Virginians less safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ekong Eshiet, who is incarcerated at Red Onion, has recently expressed concerns about his safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allegedly among those who engaged in self-harm, Eshiet was contacted by The Mercury through JPay, a service that allows incarcerated people to communicate with those who are outside the prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suggested reaching out to his sister, who did not respond to calls or messages before this article’s publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prison Radio, an organization that amplifies the voices of incarcerated individuals, has released an </span><a href="https://www.prisonradio.org/commentary/hunger-strike-and-self-immolation-update/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">audio recording of Eshiet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the recording he recounts facing discrimination due to his name and Muslim faith and described the challenges he encountered during his personal hunger strike. He also spoke openly about setting himself on fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eshiet described his situation as being “in fear for my life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expressing his hope for a transfer to another facility to serve the remainder of his  sentence, Eshiet said, “I’m trying to get up off this. I’m doing my best, like I’m going about this the right way. I guess, like with the hunger strike way. But if I have to, I don’t mind setting myself on fire again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, the situation seems like “a cry for help.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean something has to be going on, right?” she said in an interview with The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the VLBC, Favola has been working to uncover more information about potential issues within the prison. Earlier in November, she and Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, sent a letter to Dotson, requesting a detailed report after families of inmates shared troubling anecdotes about conditions at Red Onion and another facility, Wallens Ridge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t say that I have any evidence to point specific fingers at,” Favola said. However, she expressed hope that the newly established ombudsman position will facilitate  a thorough investigation into the matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, the VLBC chair, told The Mercury that he and his colleagues are still “gathering intel”on the conditions at Red Onion. As the caucus prepares to unveil its legislative priorities ahead of the upcoming General Assembly session, Bagby suggested that continued prison reform efforts may be among the initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB719" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to regulate the duration a person can spend in solitary confinement. Although Virginia law refers to the practice as “restorative housing,” concerns about its excessive use have been raised by lawmakers and reform advocates. The measure passed the Democratic-controlled legislature earlier this year but was ultimately </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+SB719AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would have mandated  mental health evaluations every two days for individuals in solitary confinement and built on a related reform </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB887" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed into law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Youngkin last year. That earlier legislation requires that people in solitary confinement receive a designated number of hours outside their cells each day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his veto message for the 2024 bill, Youngkin described the measure as “unnecessary bureaucracy” that would burden facility administrators and hinder the department’s focus on “safety and inmate rehabilitation.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Renewed hope’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, prison reform advocates, incarcerated individuals and their families continue to speak out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the recent Corrections Oversight Committee meeting, several people used the public comment period to share concerns about the conditions their loved ones have reported. They urged lawmakers to visit the prisons firsthand and called for thorough investigations into the issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimberly Dyke-Harsley El shared that a family member, currently incarcerated at Greensville Correctional Center, went several days without access to his blood pressure medication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Gigi Badawi recounted spending over a year navigating back-and-forth communications with the Department of Corrections to ensure necessary medication for her son at Indian Creek Correctional Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And activist Phil Wilayto called on  lawmakers to investigate  the allegations emerging from  Red Onion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s time for those of us who have advocated for our incarcerated loved ones to be taken seriously instead of immediately dismissed,” Badawi said. “I have renewed hope that the new ombudsman and her team will look into allegations.”</span></p>

When her son experienced a trauma this past summer, a local mobile crisis unit was able to provide immediate counseling and connect the family to follow-up mental health resources. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><i>Editor’s note: The Mercury is not identifying the name of Asheley Tuck&#8217;s son to protect the child&#8217;s identity. Tuck&#8217;s statements were substantiated through interviews with mental health professionals with knowledge of her family&#8217;s situation. </i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With books, toys and artwork strewn about, Asheley Tuck’s son’s room is the typical sort one might expect from an 11-year-old boy. What is less typical: a piece of notebook paper taped to his door labeled “safety plan.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper outlines how sudden mood shifts, loss of interests, isolation or a racing heart could be warning signs of anxiety, so that he can better recognize when an attack might be coming on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuck’s son also has notes that outline techniques — like listing types of Pokemon in alphabetical order — which can help him cope with swelling negative emotions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notes are relics from crisis response and follow-up counseling he received this past summer after he and some friends encountered an online predator during a sleepover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuck said that she and her wife didn’t know how to best comfort their son when he called to be picked up from the sleepover and confided in them what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The person) scared them and asked them to do some things that were not appropriate for anyone, much less, you know, an 11-year-old,” Tuck said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her son expressed feeling like “his life was ruined” and he was worried he would be “plastered on the internet and what the repercussions would be,” Tuck recalled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was devastated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having known people who were social workers, Tuck realized she could call Richmond’s Crisis Response and Stabilization Team (CReST). Within less than an hour, a clinician arrived at their house to provide immediate counseling to the family. After the initial visit, CReST arranged follow-up visits for a few weeks and referred the family to additional counseling services if needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fact that he got services that quickly was a game changer for how he&#8217;ll be able to navigate his life going forward,” Tuck said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the clinician who responded to Tuck’s son was part of CReST through the Richmond Behavioral Health Authority, there are similar programs around Virginia, colloquially referred to as mobile crisis units. These professionals and teams are part of Virginia’s ever-expanding landscape of mental health resources and have played a role in keeping patients in their homes rather than hospitals or, in escalated cases, jails.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Clinicians on the scene</h4>

<figure id="attachment_41484" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_3724/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-41484 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3724-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Asheley Tuck holds notes that her son kept following some emergency counseling services he utilized after experiencing a trauma. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin DeLizzio, a program manager at CReST, explained that while some staff are located in the downtown Richmond office, others have take-home cars to be dispatched from around the region, from Hanover to Farmville to Emporia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that her area, Region 4, was able to provide services to over 1,500 people in the 2024 fiscal year. Most of those people were diverted from hospitals and jails and were able to get help at their homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve got to be able to meet people where they are,” said Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a longtime champion for bolstering mental health resources in Virginia who supported the 2021 legislation that paved the way for mobile crisis units and other services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CReST’s responses to calls for help can range from de-escalating situations over the phone to dispatching clinicians to meet with people directly. Sometimes patients need immediate counseling and connections to follow-up resources like therapists or psychiatrists. Sometimes they might need to be admitted to crisis receiving centers — which operate like emergency rooms in hospitals, but focus on mental health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinicians can be dispatched when people call the regional mobile crisis line directly or when routed through emergency calls to 911 or 988, a national mental health crisis hotline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the national mental health emergency hotline transitioned to the easier-to-remember 988 system, Virginia </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0248" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021 funded expanded call centers and listed the deployment of mobile crisis units as part of 988’s responsibilities. The service has been </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/09/25/virginia-988-hotline-mental-health-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin has said he sees as a success because it means people are connected to resources before a crisis can escalate further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s three-year </span><a href="https://www.hhr.virginia.gov/12-14-2022-Two-Page-BH-Plan-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Help, Right Now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plan entails budget proposals from the governor and legislative actions by state lawmakers focused on mental health care. Youngkin recently celebrated the two year anniversary of the initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right Help, Right Now is working,” he declared excitedly at a press conference on the two year anniversary of the initiative, Dec. 11. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative’s bipartisan efforts build on a decade’s worth of work spearheaded by Deeds and the Behavioral Health Commission he helped establish. Outside of legislative sessions, the commission undertakes studies and hears from experts around the state to craft or endorse legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent years have seen new solutions born from local tragedies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill dubbed “Irvo’s Law” allows families access to their loved one if they are taken into custody by law enforcement during a crisis. Its inspiration stemmed from the death of Henrico resident Irvo Otineo, who died in a mental health hospital while constrained by law enforcement officers and staff, and whose mother was denied access to him there.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 law called the “</span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/human-resource-development-and-management/health-equity/mdpa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcus Alert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” stems from the death of Richmond resident Marcus-David Peters, who was killed by police in 2018 during a mental health crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a growing number of Virginia localities implement the law, it enables coordination between 911 and regional call centers to triage the best response from law enforcement and trained clinicians when handling mental health situations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A main goal is to not hospitalize someone if we can,” said Abigayle Hodges, a mobile crisis unit team leader at CReST. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trying to keep the peace</h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, law enforcement officers are the first responders to crises and  escort people to hospitals where they sit waiting with them. Other times, people may be subject to emergency custody orders, which is when a magistrate orders that someone needs to be evaluated by health professionals because they could be a harm to themselves or others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consensus has been building between some lawmakers and members of law enforcement that officers and deputies aren’t always the best people to take point or remain with people in crises for longer periods of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only should there be less police interactions with someone who’s going through a crisis, but when you’re looking at rural areas such as the county where I’m from and small police departments throughout the region, then taking just one person off patrol can hurt a community,” said Tazewell County Sheriff Brian Hieatt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent </span><a href="https://bhc.virginia.gov/documents/BHC%20Staff%20-%20ABLEO.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Virginia’s Behavioral Health Commission also noted how arrests of people in mental health crises have a “devastating impact” on those in crisis and that it can “stress local and state resources.” People in crisis can also be more prone to lashing out and assaulting an officer, regardless of their coherence or intent, and end up facing jail time as a result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his forthcoming budget presentation for 2025, Youngkin hopes that $35 million can be invested into creating “</span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/licensure-and-regulatory-affairs/special-conservators-peace" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special Conservators of the Peace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” he said this week. These are both armed and unarmed positions authorized by courts to carry out limited law enforcement duties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While resources like 988 and mobile crisis units can help prevent people from going to the hospital, Youngkin believes the conservators can help improve the outcomes of those who are taken to hospitals by law enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Officers) are brought into many of these circumstances that not only distract them from so many other responsibilities, but then have an individual who&#8217;s in crisis enter the criminal justice system unnecessarily — we need to address both of those,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While state lawmakers will still need to collaborate with Youngkin throughout the first few months of 2025 to decide how the state’s budget will be allocated, Youngkin sees the conservator program as a temporary solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should see a reduction in hospital admittance, and therefore a reduction in the law enforcement needs around the hospital,” Youngkin said. “But for the time being, having our cops in place that allow this transfer of custody is really important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna Czaplicki Ryan, a program supervisor at CReST, described how some transfer of care is already happening between law enforcement and clinicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A ‘warm handoff’ is the terminology we use,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CReST staff and law enforcement already have some experience working together in instances where police are at the scene of an emergency first and ask for assistance or for clinicians to take over care, Czaplicki Ryan explained. When officers and clinicians demonstrate the transfer of care to patients, it can help them feel supported and know they are “not abandoned.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deeds, who serves on the Senate’s finance committee, said that he’s “fine with” Youngkin’s conservator proposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just think that our focus should not necessarily be on the moment of crisis,” Deeds said. “Our focus also needs to be on prevention, on keeping people out of crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Asheley Tuck, whose son experienced a trauma, she said that she’s glad she knew that 988 and CReST existed in their moment of need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a friend had not mentioned that this program exists, I may not have known about it at all,” she said. “I think it should be regular public knowledge.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks at an early vote rally in Chesterfield on Oct. 26, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of his annual budget presentation to lawmakers next week, Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Thursday announced a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/embargo-dec-12.pdf">proposal</a> to block state funding from any locality implementing a “sanctuary city” policy and “refusing to comply with federal law to deport” undocumented immigrants who have committed a crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term sanctuary city refers to localities that choose to have limited or no cooperation with the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If adopted in the final state budget, the Department of Criminal Justice Services director will be required to withhold from sanctuary city localities state funding that is usually earmarked for local police departments. The Compensation Board will also be required to withhold state per diem payments to local and regional jails. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal would also require local law enforcement and jail officials to provide notification to ICE 48 hours ahead of the release of  immigrants lacking permanent legal status who have committed a crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s administration noted a recent </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/virginia-crime-herndon-virginia-man-arrest-repeat-offender-sexual-assault-rape-case-denis-humberto-navarette-romero-united-states-immigration-deportation-ice-illegal-immigrant-migrant-washington-old-dominion-railroad-trail-investigation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of an immigrant man in the U.S. illegallywith a previous criminal history who allegedly raped a woman on a running trail in Herndon, court documents show. Youngkin’s announcement also pointed out an instance this summer in Fairfax County where an undocumented person suspected of sex crimes against minors was </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/fairfax-county-virginia-immigration-detainers-ice-services-migrants-undocumented-child-sex-crimes-tim-kaine-hung-cao-deportation?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not detained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of cities and counties in Virginia have adopted policies to stop f law enforcement and municipal staff from voluntarily inquiring about a person’s immigration status, including  Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax County and the city of Richmond. While most of the policies do entail compliance with ICE as federally mandated, they outline how municipal staff don’t need to make extra efforts to identify people who are potentially here illegally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Arlington’s 2022 Trust Policy states that the city “will comply with all applicable federal or state regulations mandating cooperation with ICE and other federal immigration</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">officials &#8230; but will otherwise restrict sharing of personally identifiable information that could be used to further immigration enforcement efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/2017/02/06/stoney-policies-of-inclusion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Richmond mayor Levar Stoney, however, entails noncompliance with ICE. Richmond City Jail and a few others around Virginia were listed as “non-compliant institutions” in an ICE report from June 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late November, according to the DCJS, nearly 1,000 incarcerated people in Virginia have had open immigration detainer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for Youngkin’s proposal to take effect, it will need to be approved by the state legislature during 2025’s state budget negotiations. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in House District 26 and Senate District 32, many of whom had just cast ballots in last month’s presidential and congressional elections, are now being called back to the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voters who support reproductive rights, you cannot sit this one out,” Repro Rising Virginia Director Tarina Keene told attendees at a gathering in Ashburn Wednesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic control of Virginia’s House and Senate is seen as critical to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/06/national-democratic-group-boosts-srinivassan-singh-in-upcoming-virginia-special-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advancing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a proposed constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights. Securing both chambers would give </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, who currently hold a slim 21-19 edge in the Senate and a 51-48 majority in the House, a stronger position to push forward the amendment in a state where Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin maintains veto power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While abortion is not strictly a partisan issue, it often divides lawmakers along partisan lines. During last year’s statewide General Assembly elections, many Republicans supported Youngkin’s proposal to restrict most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. In contrast, Democrats campaigned on preserving the state’s existing abortion laws, with a long-term goal of enshrining abortion protections in the state Constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, was elected to Congress in November, Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, secured the Democratic nomination to succeed him in the Virginia Senate. To fill Srinivasan’s seat in the House of Delegates, first-time candidate J.J. Singh earned the Democratic nomination, positioning himself as a fresh face in the party’s push to maintain its legislative majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents of the 26th House District can cast their votes between now and Jan. 7, choosing between Singh and Republican challenger Ram Venkatachalam. Meanwhile, voters in Senate District 32 will decide  between Srinivasan and Republican Tumay Harding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venkatachalam and Harding did not respond to requests for comment on their positions regarding abortion access as of publication, and Venkatachalam’s campaign </span><a href="https://ramforva.com/why-im-running/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not reference  reproductive health or abortion, leaving his stance on this issue unclear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harding’s campaign </span><a href="https://tumayforva.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states that she believes life “begins at conception.” She also emphasizes the need for measures to support expecting parents and “reduce abortions.” Additionally, Harding acknowledges that most abortions later in pregnancy are already prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, abortions are allowed for any reason through the second trimester, which lasts until about 26 weeks of pregnancy. In the third trimester, abortions are only permitted with the approval of three doctors. A proposed constitutional amendment would ease that requirement, allowing a single doctor to authorize a third-trimester abortion if it is deemed necessary to protect the pregnant person’s life or mental health, or if the fetus is deemed non-viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no universal definition of fetal viability — the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the womb — doctors typically assess it on a case-by-case basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than 1% of abortions occur after 21 weeks of pregnancy, according to the most recent </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/data-statistics/abortion-surveillance-findings-reports.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some abortions that occur within the second or third trimester have been the result of </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">severe fetal anomalies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, low</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/fatal-anomaly-exception-didnt-spare-alabama-mom-who-needed-an-abortion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fetal viability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or stem from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/24/these-u-s-supreme-court-cases-could-affect-abortion-access-nationwide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medical emergencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only Southern state without strict abortion restrictions or a ban, Virginia has also become an important access point for people seeking abortions from neighboring states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I cannot imagine what women are going through in those states, dealing with situations where politicians should not be interfering (and) should not be involved,” Srinivasan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Singh also shared personal connections to reproductive healthcare laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Srinivasan shared a story about his wife, who was once told that her life would be at risk if she became pregnant. Singh, too, emphasized the importance of reproductive rights, especially for his young daughters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have two young daughters and I care about their access to reproductive health,” Singh said. “I don’t want politicians in the doctor’s offices with them as they make decisions about their own bodies.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a Republican-controlled White House, U.S. House and Senate on the horizon, some special elections in Virginia next month are the first opportunity for voters to challenge or reinforce Democratic majorities in the state legislature.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is putting a spotlight on Senate District 32 and House District 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After winning a Democratic primary, Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, will face off against Republican Tumay Harding to be elected to the Virginia Senate. He could succeed Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, who was elected to the U.S. Congress last month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, J.J. Singh, who won a Democratic primary for Loudoun County-based House District 26, could potentially succeed Srinivasan’s House seat. He faces Republican Ram Venkatachalam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DLCC director Heather Williams issued a statement noting that protecting Democrats’ slim majorities will “position us to be competitive in November when the entire House of Delegates is on the ballot alongside a competitive </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/25/spanberger-and-earle-sears-tied-in-first-2025-gubernatorial-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gubernatorial race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats currently have a 21-19 edge in the Senate and a  51-48 lead in the House with Republican Glenn Youngkin as governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that Virginia can be a key indicator of “what the fight ahead looks like” to build Democratic power in states amid the Republican majorities in federal government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortifying the Democratic firewall in the states has never been more important, and that work starts in Virginia,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the DLCC “spotlight” program, Srinivasan and Singh will be assisted in fundraising and can tap into DLCC experts on staff for advice or help with organizing. The group has boosted legislative candidates around the country and focuses on seats that are crucial for protecting or making majorities, said Sam Paisley, an interim communications director with DLCC. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic majority can jumpstart planned constitutional amendments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While DLCC is watching key state elections around the country for how they can support Democrats’ ability to balance out federal GOP majorities, Virginia’s Democratic majorities will be a key part of advancing planned amendments to the state’s constitution.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. House panel advances amendments on abortion rights, marriage equality and voting rights&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/embed/#?secret=SmIsD8zngc#?secret=j6PDqB758w" data-secret="j6PDqB758w" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendments would enshrine abortion access protections into the constitution, remove a prohibition on same-sex marriage from it, and create an automatic process for formerly incarcerated people with felony convictions to have their rights restored. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is the least-restrictive Southern state when it comes to abortion access. The matter was paramount in the 2023 state legislative elections as Democrats vowed to protect current law (and eventually enshrine it into the constitution) and many Republicans coalesced around a 15-week cap on most abortions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, any abortion occurring in the third trimester requires approval from three doctors. The new amendment would reduce that threshold to one doctor, should a later stage abortion be deemed necessary to protect the life or mental health of the pregnant person or should their fetus be deemed not viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no national definition of fetal viability — which refers to the likelihood of a fetus being able to survive outside of the womb — doctors typically make the determination on a case-by-case basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, people with felony convictions are all but permanently disenfranchised from various rights, even after they’ve completed prison sentences. Previous governors’ administrations had streamlined a restoration process. Then Youngkin’s administration made it petition-based with unclear criteria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That meant that hundreds of applicants this year were rejected — and therefore </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unable to vote </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in presidential and congressional elections — without knowing why. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This amendment creates a process that is bound by transparent rules and criteria that will apply equally to everybody,” the bill’s sponsor Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria said last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the third amendment would allow Virginia to continue recognizing same-sex marriages should federal protections be undone, as they were with abortion protections. Since a 2006 amendment, </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article1/section15-A/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defines marriage between a man and a woman. Though it’s been rendered moot since a 2015 Supreme Court of the United States decision, some lawmakers and LGBTQ advocates have stressed the importance of removing the prohibition in case that precedent were to fall (as Supreme Court judge Clarence Thomas has </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/dem-lawmakers-want-to-put-same-sex-marriage-in-virginia-s-constitution/article_46aa7008-ab32-11ee-af3d-e79f1e61bf21.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed interest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in revisiting). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a Democrat-led panel was able to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all three amendments earlier this month, the marriage equality one saw bipartisan support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing these policies into the constitution would make them less subject to partisan shifts in the legislature or governors’ mansion — but it’s also a longer process than just passing one law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constitutional amendments have to clear both chambers of the legislature two years in a row, with a House of Delegates election in between. From there, they can appear as ballot referendums for voters around the state to approve or reject. This means voters could weigh in by November 2026 — if the proposals pass in 2025 and earlier in 2026. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate District 10 special election still unclear</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Srinivasan and Singh have the chance to lock down Democratic control in each chamber, the Republican-leaning state senate seat still hasn’t had its special election set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover told The Mercury that he was confident there would also be an election to replace McGuire on Jan. 7, but did not elaborate further. As of this week, he relayed that there are no new updates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who was reached by phone, said to send him an email. He did not respond by the time of this publication. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, has been frustrated by large investment firms purchasing homes in Virginia. Both in </span><a href="https://x.com/GlenSturtevant/status/1860751697703739745" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media and in a Zoom call open to the public and press on Wednesday, he outlined some policy proposals that he hopes can help with affordable housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, he laid out his legislative efforts to reign in investment firms. After an unsuccessful </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB693" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempt </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2024, he said that he’s reworking his bill for the 2025 session. If passed, it would prohibit investment firms worth more than $50 million from purchasing homes. Similar ideas have </span><a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/01/05/hedge-fund-rental-housing-home-affordable-representative-adam-smith-congress-" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been introduced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Congress and other state legislatures, so Sturtevant wants to try it in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is intended to target the big Wall Street investors, not your mom-and-pop investors who buy a home and flip it or who have a duplex under management,” he said.</span></p>

Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, in 2019. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, he hopes it can help people who are struggling to afford a home, particularly first-time homebuyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A meeting attendee named Holly Dougherty wrote in the group chat that her adult children are losing out on homebuying opportunities to investors with cash offers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There needs to be a way to keep young families in the community,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturtevant said that anecdotally, it’s been a “nightmare” for “millennials and older Gen Zers who are coming out of school and trying to buy their first home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to data from </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/investor-home-purchases-q2-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redfin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that confirms a spike in investment firms purchasing homes. Investors bought one out of every six homes in the nation and one out of every four low-priced homes that sold in the second quarter of this year. Single-family homes made up nearly 70% of their purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturtevant also pointed out how investment firms can sit on properties rather than redeveloping them or selling them, with a team of people analyzing the best moment they can sell for the highest price, despite having an advantage over individual buyers when acquiring the property in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s ultimately not fair for them to be competing with regular people,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other legislation Sturtevant wants to spearhead would allow homebuyers to inherit a seller’s mortgage and its rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of where people could see immediate benefit through that measure, he said, are people who were able to purchase a home or refinance their home during lower rates when the COVID-19 pandemic was surging. A new buyer could inherit that benefit if the law were to pass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, he said he is exploring ways to incentivize companies in the commonwealth to offer down payment assistance to employees. He said that the idea is to benefit both young employees who may lack the cash for down payments while also nurturing workforce development and keeping people in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Sturtevant is still fine-tuning his proposals with Virginia’s Division of Legislative Services — legal experts that assist lawmakers in drafting legislation — he stressed that the laws are only part of broader solutions when it comes to the state’s affordable housing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Saxman, a former state delegate who hosted the Zoom call, noted how “everybody seems to be having housing issues these days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing was a prominent topic in this year’s local and federal elections. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris (who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offered </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a downpayment assistance proposal) and President-elect Donald Trump talked about the nation’s housing needs during their campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though housing is typically addressed at the local level, in Wednesday’s Zoom Saxman and Sturtevant reflected on ways state and federal governments can help with supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saxman said that he thinks Sturtevant’s bills might be hard to vote against, especially with the House of Delegates up for election in 2025. His ideas will first need to clear the Senate before review by the House and approval from the governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who chairs the Housing Commission, welcomes Sturtevant’s intended work in addressing housing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she stressed that Republicans have not always been on board with supporting other efforts to boost affordable housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Accessible and affordable housing has been at the forefront of the Democratic agenda for decades, (with) proposals often thwarted by our Republican colleagues,” she said. “That was never more evident than during the housing crisis in the 2009-2010 time frame and during the eviction crisis. Many voted against the budget that included funding for the Housing Trust Fund.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locke said that she is “glad to know some finally understand this is a serious problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have put forward measures this year to address housing challenges in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield carried a proposal called “5,000 Families,” which would provide rental relief to certain families with school-age children to prevent displacement during academic years. Though it did not pass this year, housing groups have their </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/virginia-housing-groups-look-ahead-to-2025-for-legislative-funding-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eye on it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for next session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike’s Senate Bill 597 would have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-to-boost-affordable-housing-advances-to-youngkin/article_33e7b884-dd8e-11ee-96af-a7e0399a77a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more local governments to utilize federal housing tax credits to encourage the development of additional affordable housing — typically associated with ranges of an area’s median income. The bill cleared both chambers before being vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both proposals may resurface in the next legislative session beginning in January, and Sturtevant will try again on his investment firm bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature was able to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approve a series of housing reforms </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this year. Some support renters, while another bill established a workgroup that can explore future </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/25/virginia-considering-future-building-code-updates-that-could-help-with-infill-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building code changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another successful bill was aimed at protecting existing mobile home parks — a vulnerable but affordable type of housing for which residents own their homes, but not the land beneath it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Youngkin also recently issued </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/workforce-housing-directive-to-bolster-economic-development-and-new-home-construction-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a directive </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to invest up to $75 million towards localities that want to bolster housing supply tied to new job creation over the next five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This isn’t partisan stuff,” Saxman said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While acknowledging the findings of the inspector general report, Balmer said he plans to refute some of it as “inaccuracies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city’s inspector general had launched a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/richmond-inspector-general-investigating-citys-elections-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">probe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Balmer’s office earlier this year following allegations of nepotism and misuse of money. According to documents obtained by The Mercury through a Freedom of Information Act request, a former employee had shared unverified allegations of management issues, including “hiring family and friends,” along with questionable spending and other concerns within the office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​Richmond Inspector General James Osuna’s report, released Nov. 26, verified 25 of 26 allegations against Balmer’s management of the office that included improper use of city-issued purchasing cards, overspending on items, purchasing a handgun so a worker could act as an armed security guard and spending public money on alcohol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials had suspended Balmer’s purchasing card access this past summer amid the investigation and as a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/registrar-balmer-city-credit-card-investigation-elections-office/article_6be2d0e8-146b-11ef-971d-1f0b4090e555.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">records review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by The Richmond Times-Dispatch showed $70,000 in charges during 2023. The inspector general report revealed that roughly $500,000 in public funding has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/26/investigation-finds-nearly-500000-in-waste-fraud-and-abuse-in-richmond-elections-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been wasted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overall. Balmer pushed back against the findings Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s (Osuna’s) report,” he said. “My rebuttal is my report. A lot of what is in the report is absolutely true, but there are things I take issue with and I want the public to know that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer plans to make both a rebuttal statement and his resignation letter publicly available, he told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. He added that his rebuttal will have documentation included that should show that “it&#8217;s more like administrative mistakes” than criminal actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the alcohol use, he said he never drank on the job. He defended the gun purchase as something he felt was necessary following a violent altercation between two employees and concerns over violence against election workers leading up to the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked if there’s anything he would have done differently, Balmer said on day one of becoming registrar he would have made sure that he and his staff had training. He claimed that he was given paperwork to sign but no formal training and he relied on the assumption that more of his staff had been trained as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that the next registrar should have deep knowledge of city codes, and be able to pair administrative leadership with their election worker experience. </span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">A Publix pharmacy manager retrieves medication.  (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southside Virginia resident Wendy Oliver’s body might be frail amid her struggle with Lupus — an autoimmune disease that has rendered her disabled — but her spirit is strong as she and her husband navigate accessing her pain medication amid national drug shortages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This (disease) is something I have to deal with, but I don&#8217;t need to deal with the uncertainty on whether I&#8217;m going to be able to acquire my medications,” she said. “That&#8217;s a stress that nobody should have to go through.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Lupus, a person’s immune system attacks healthy organs and tissues. In Oliver’s case, it has targeted her bones the most.  She had to give up a veterinarian technician career and her husband has had to be her main caregiver in recent decades. Oliver sustains her quality of life through a few 4 milligram doses of hydromorphone per day. The drug, commonly marketed as Diluadid, is a type of opioid that at a low dose, plays a key role in managing her pain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s been increasingly difficult for her to obtain in the past six months. Based near Farmville, the couple has had to place calls and make drives within hours of their home to get her medication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress can also trigger flare ups with her disease, worsening its symptoms. Between the efforts to get medication lately and concerns about potentially igniting withdrawal symptoms should she miss doses, she’s “terrified.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated, she reached out to U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, as well as various federal agencies to relay her concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine, along with U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, might be able to help Oliver and others with new legislation they are both proposing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They introduced the </span><a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/cotton1204.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting Our Essential Medicines Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday to help address shortages in the drug supply chain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would work by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to maintain a list of the country of origin of certain critical drugs marketed in the United States. The agency would work through a task force with other federal agencies to identify drugs for which a shortage could affect people with chronic conditions, as well as those which might be critical for epidemics or pandemics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal agencies that would be directed into a task force are “the ones you would expect,” Kaine said, like HHS, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the Department of Defence and Department of Homeland Security are also included, even though they are “not the ones you would necessarily see” participating in such an effort, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Sen. Cotton) and I are seeing this as more than just a public health thing,” Kaine said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said that approach stems from some lessons learned amid the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, where China, as the country of origin, had to prioritize its people over whatever drug or equipment contracts it had abroad. Likewise, when he was previously the governor of Virginia, he recalled how there was a moment of concern about having enough of a drug that alleviates influenza symptoms at a time when the bird flu was looming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new bill also builds on a recent related bipartisan and bicameral bill that included U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William. The</span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-cotton-spanberger-and-smith-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-end-drug-shortages-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> End Drug Shortages Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to improve communications between hospitals, manufacturers and pharmacies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine used an environmental analogy to further explain that measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We often put river monitoring gauges on rivers, and the farther upstream you put them, the sooner you know when there might be a flood downstream,” he said. “It&#8217;s really about information sharing early on, so that we can predict when there may be spikes in demand that would require more production.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a Virginia-specific note, he believes that pharmaceutical companies clustered in Richmond and Petersburg may have important roles to play in U.S. manufacturing of medicines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the new bill he introduced with Cotton hopes to address the challenges through an international lens, with a keen focus on national security and public health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we get the whole federal family around the table to do these listings of drugs — where they come from, which of these drugs would be really deleterious to public health if there were shortages  — that can give us information that might lead us to make certain decisions about production,” Kaine said. </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Board of Elections officially certified this year’s election on Monday, affirming the results of local, congressional and national contests in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bottom line is that we had safe and fair elections in Virginia this year,” said John O’Bannon, the chair of the board who was appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday’s certification solidified Vice President Kamala Harris’ win of Virginia’s 13 electoral college votes, despite her ultimate loss to Donald Trump, whose second term in the White House begins next month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other certified elections included local contests around the state along with congressional elections and one of Virginia’s U.S. Senate seats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals also reported that two risk-limiting audits after the elections confirmed the wins of both Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine and U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk-limiting audits are when random samples of hand-counted ballots are analyzed. Virginia conducts the audits after elections are complete but before they are certified each year. For anyone curious about more details of the audits, Beals said that a full report will be provided at the board’s January 2025 meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that two of Virginia’s upcoming special elections will occur on Jan. 7 of next year — Senate District 32 and House District 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because Democratic Sen. Suhas Subramanyam was elected to Congress so he will vacate that seat. And, since Del. Kannan Srinivasan won a Democratic primary in hopes to replace Subramanyam in the state senate, he will vacate his House seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a special election has yet to be officially set for Senate District 10, as Sen. John McGuire was elected to Congress but </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/mcguire-still-hasnt-resigned-his-state-senate-seat-weeks-after-congressional-win/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hasn’t formally resigned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from his state seat. State</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter2/section24.2-216/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlines that a special election date must be set within 30 days of a vacancy or notification of it — whichever happens first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a 21-19 edge in favor of Democrats, a Republican failing to fill McGuire’s seat would give Democrats a bit more lead in the next legislative session. But Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, told The Mercury last week that he expects a special election will occur on Jan. 7. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s 2025 legislative session will begin on Jan. 8. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Virginia’s electoral board has often drawn public comment, no one offered feedback in Monday’s scarcely-attended meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citizens in Virginia and elsewhere who denied President Joe Biden’s win over Trump in 2020 have questioned electoral boards nationwide. Meanwhile, recent drama among local electoral boards around the state has</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/17/special-prosecutor-trying-to-sort-out-elections-drama-in-nottoway-county/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sometimes spilled </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">into state electoral board meetings. Multiple Capitol Police officers have been present, as they were on Monday’s calm and procedural meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Party of Virginia chairman Rich Anderson and Democratic Party of Virginia chairwoman Susan Swecker had </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/state-party-leaders-show-support-for-virginias-elections/article_e68409be-92e0-11ee-a7cb-17550b97fe80.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">both attended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the certification meeting of 2023’s elections to present as a unified front and shore up  trust in elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were not present at this year’s certification, but other members of DPVA were. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake Rubenstein, who served as Virginia’s director for Harris’ campaign, said election deniers are “just worried about winning elections for themselves — whether that means complaining if they don&#8217;t get the results they want, or saying ‘everything is fine’ when the result is what they wanted.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that DPVA is “incredibly proud” of election officials around the state for carrying out their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a text message, Anderson said the results validated “what we knew all along: that Virginian voters can have confidence that our electoral processes are safe, secure and transparent.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers in Virginia’s Legislative Black Caucus say a dozen prisoners have harmed themselves since mid-September and want an investigation into inmates’ claims of poor living conditions and treatment in the high-security prison. Earlier this year prisoners there held </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/hunger-strike-red-onion-prison-virginia/article_be16e382-affc-11ee-8c36-437a567e5383.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hunger strikes</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to protest conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People who have been incarcerated at Red Onion State Prison describe being regularly subjected to racial and physical abuse from correctional officers, medical neglect including the withholding of medicine, excessive stays in solitary confinement with one report of 600 consecutive days, inedible food having been covered in maggots and officers’ spit, and violent dog attacks,” according to the release from the Black Caucus. “These repeated and tragic self-immolation attempts, and accompanying hunger strikes, reflect the psychological and physical toll that gruesome prison conditions can have on incarcerated individuals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Wednesday statement from DOC director Chadwick Dotson confirmed that six people had burned themselves by “using improvised devices that were created by tampering with electrical outlets.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that all six were treated for their injuries and returned to Red Onion where they have been referred to the mental health staff for treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez, a spokesperson for Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said that the governor was aware of the situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson also had pointed words for groups making allegations against Red Onion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The recent round of stories about Red Onion are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to try to score cheap political points by advocacy groups who pursue prison abolition and policies that would make Virginians less safe,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alison Chaffin, who has a loved one in Red Onion, said that she was frustrated by Dotson’s response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(VBLC) asked him to investigate, and then this is his response,” she said. “He says ‘It&#8217;s not self-immolating.” But they burned themselves — I thought that was the definition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, lawmakers in Virginia’s Black Caucus stressed their commitment to legislation, pointing to a bill to regulate the number of days an incarcerated person can spend in solitary confinement. The bill passed the legislature this year before being</span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB719" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality that these individuals felt there was no other avenue to have their claims taken seriously, investigated, and remedied is a grave indictment of the Commonwealth of Virginia and reminds us of the urgent need for comprehensive prison reform,” the VBLC statement said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than labeling it solitary confinement, Virginia has what it calls “</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title53.1/chapter2/section53.1-39.2/#:~:text=5.-,An%20incarcerated%20person%20who%20has%20been%20placed%20in%20restorative%20housing,may%20include%20recreation%20in%20a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restorative housing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is defined as “special purpose bed assignments operated under maximum security regulations and procedures and utilized for the personal protection or custodial management of an incarcerated person.”</span></p>

(Gary Cifers/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, central Virginia’s district of the state health department reported a cat in Lynchburg tested positive for rabies, following at least four cases in the Lynchburg area and </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/208/2024/10/2024-3rd-QTR-POS.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">272 positive rabies tests </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in animals statewide so far this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the full year’s numbers haven’t been reported yet,</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/208/2023/07/Yearly-Positives-2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 381 animals tested positive for rabies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabies is a fatal viral disease that can spread to people and pets through bites and scratches of animals that are infected. It causes brain swelling and other symptoms like delirium, seizures and hallucinations before leading to death, according to the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html#:~:text=Rabies%20is%20a%20fatal%20but,not%20received%20before%20symptoms%20start." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. About 60,000 people are treated for rabies each year in the United States; fewer than 10 deaths are reported each year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rabies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is almost 100% fatal once symptoms develop, timely treatment in the U.S. seems to be 100% effective,” said Jim Bowles, a health manager in the Central Virginia Health District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC notes that while preventable, rabies still poses a public health risk because of how deadly it is and its prevalence in many wildlife species. Nearly three in four Americans live in communities where there are racoons, skunks or foxes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state tests between 3,000 and 4,000 animals per year for rabies. Of the 272 total infected animals statewide this year, racoons, skunks, foxes and cats had the most positive tests. Fairfax County had the most positive tests, with 27 of its 38 coming from racoons. Loudoun County had 15 positive tests, 9 of which stemmed from raccoons. Both localities had higher tests </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/20/some-good-news-virginias-2023-rabies-numbers-are-looking-normal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in recent years as well</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowles said this is why local health departments follow up on reports of animal bites to humans and all reports where housepets may have been exposed to rabies. In cases where a person is bitten by a housepet, the owner is instructed to confine the animal for 10 days to be monitored, Bowles said. In instances where a person is bitten by a wild animal and it’s able to be confined, it will be tested for rabies. Should a wild animal not be able to be confined and tested or the animal does test positive, the bitten person may need to receive treatments to prevent the development of rabies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other animals tested statewide include dogs, beavers, bobcats, cows, foxes, goats, groundhogs, horses and opossums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the CDC outlines that the incubation period between the time of a bite and the appearance of symptoms can range from weeks or months (and depends on the person’s vaccination status, age and how close a bite is to their brain), once symptoms appear the disease is almost always fatal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bowles stressed two points for aiding in prevention of rabies cases: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure that your pets are vaccinated and report to the local health department when people are bitten by animals.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of Virginians who are unhoused has been on the rise, according to various data sources. A </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/01/08/homelessness-virginia-statistics-data-how-many" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development showed that in 2023, roughly 7.8 per 10,000 people in Virginia were experiencing homelessness. Recent point-in-time counts in the greater Richmond area showed an </span><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/5f4255d0/files/uploaded/_GRCoC_2024_Annual_Report_%287%29.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in unhoused citizens over the past year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While localized data can point to particular spikes in unhoused populations it doesn’t encompass all types of housing crises people can face, or truly capture how many people experience homelessness over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura Dobbs, a policy analyst with Housing Opportunities Made Equal, noted that someone might technically be homeless for only a few months, as opposed to someone more permanently unhoused who lives on streets, in parks or in shelters. But their temporary status is “still traumatic,” she stressed, and can still take time to financially and emotionally recover from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a lot of people that whether they live in a hotel or they’re couch surfing or splitting their kids between different family members — they may only be homeless for three months, but it’s still an unstable three months,” Dobbs said. “Those people might not get captured in a point-in-time count, but they still need services to help them regain stability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s why her organization and others support state legislation aimed at helping to reduce or prevent evictions as well as broader efforts to increase housing stock and affordability. And of course, continued funding for organizations that work directly with those who are experiencing homelessness is a continuing need, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Solving the housing crisis is primarily local through things like zoning and planning, but the state can incentivize things,” said Homeward executive director Kelly King Horne. Her organization is part of the Greater Richmond Continuum of Care — a consortium of groups working to prevent and reduce homelessness. Various organizations around Virginia coordinate on this work as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/5f4255d0/files/uploaded/_GRCoC_2024_Annual_Report_%287%29.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published last month found that Greater Richmond Continuum of Care agencies encountered over 7,500 people seeking assistance within fiscal year 2024, ranging from emergency shelter requests to needing assistance to stay in their homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Richmond-area efforts have been underway over the last year as well. This past June, people were able to move into Cool Lane Commons, an 86-unit supportive housing apartment in Henrico County. The project stemmed from collaboration of local governments and organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a new (Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority) policy approved by HUD, the GRCoC Coordinated Entry System can make referrals directly to projects like this,” the continuum’s latest report stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past October the City of Richmond also opened its Office of Homeless Services on Chamberlayne Avenue. For people who lack a phone or computer, the center is a face-to-face option for connections to various regional housing resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those in need of shelter, however, a mens’ and veterans’ shelter on Grace St. plans to close by the end of the year due to funding challenges. This knowledge, paired with a recent Richmond city council vote to allocate $2 million to a new animal shelter, inspired Virginia’s NAACP housing chair Tracey Hardney-Scott to </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-naacp-city-council-funding-nov-18-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voice concern</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can&#8217;t be saying that animals would take precedence over people,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardney-Scott hopes to see a boost in funding that can be earmarked specifically for shelters. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legislative proposals</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isabel McLain with the Virginia Housing Alliance said that her organization will press lawmakers on funding for housing efforts in their next revision of the state budget. Examples include funding that can go towards rapid rehousing efforts and operational funding for organizations that work with unhoused or vulnerable residents. It will also support efforts to assist people before they experience homelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Housing Alliance will also be supportive of programs that can help prevent displacement, such as a proposal called “5,000 Families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carried last year by Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, the initiative failed to make it into the most recent state budget. If implemented, the program would provide rental relief to certain families with school-age children to prevent displacement during academic years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Something Dobbs said she’ll be watching for is anti-rent gouging legislation. Earlier this year, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax carried a bill that would allow localities to set their own provisions that would require landlords to give two months’ written notice ahead of rent increases. It would also set certain parameters of what the increases could be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardney-Scott said that her organization is in conversation with legislators about which specific bills may be introduced or reintroduced next year. Like McLain, a revival of Boysko’s bill is something she plans to keep watch for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill that could get another shot at becoming law may be one the legislature already approved: </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-to-boost-affordable-housing-advances-to-youngkin/article_33e7b884-dd8e-11ee-96af-a7e0399a77a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 597</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, would have allowed more Virginia localities to craft zoning ordinances to encourage affordable housing by using special federal tax credits. Despite House and Senate approval, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hardney-Scott engages with legal and nonprofit organizations and lawmakers, she hopes to see more widespread discussion of the role housing plays in peoples’ lives and communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not having enough conversations about how (housing struggles) affect health and education or contribute to crime,” Hardney-Scott said. “Housing is the one thing that everybody needs.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal housing changes may be on the horizon</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horne, of Homeward noted how some housing solutions may be out of any states’ hands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Funding is always going to be number one, especially if there’s cuts at the federal level,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dobbs concurred. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s hard to predict just how much (funding is) going to be cut from HUD,” she said. “A lot of local governments rely on funding from HUD to do things that come with services and prevention efforts, and without that federal funding, we&#8217;re really going to rely on the state even more to help support localities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though President-elect Donald Trump has shied away from the “Project 2025” playbook from conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, he has been </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised by the organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for utilizing their guidance in his previous term. Several of its authors are former Trump officials, including former HUD secretary Dr. Ben Carson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 15</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of “Project 2025” Carsonhe suggested that Congress should </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“consider a wholesale overhaul of HUD that contemplates devolving many HUD functions to states and localities with any remaining federal functions consolidated to other federal agencies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s both unclear how long such a downsizing of the federal agency would take and if it would happen, but Virginia housing advocates stress that the state legislature continues to empower and support local governments and organizations that work with them. </span></p>

(Courtesy of SDI Productions via Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-43---FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 43 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Thursday, which enacted a multi-pronged effort to address the impact of social media use on children’s mental health. The order established the Reclaiming Childhood Task Force to counter “addictive” social media use in youth and “create opportunities for cultural change.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive came months after the governor issued an executive order requiring the Department of Education to draft guidelines for cell phone-free schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest order will mobilize state agencies to provide resources for parents, educators and healthcare providers to “combat the negative effects of excessive social media use.” It will also spur the agencies to create a toolkit with training materials and educational resources that will “offer educational and technical support” for health care providers and families to promote healthy social media use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The scope of this challenge is going to require all of us, private sector, non-profit organizations and (the) government to support parents as they work to improve their children’s mental health,” Youngkin said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task force will convene parents, youth, teachers, mental health experts, faith leaders, public safety officials and private sector technology experts to compile recommendations to share with Youngkin and members of the General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secretary of Health and Human Resources Janet Kelly noted the “addictive” nature of social media algorithms. The order cites Pew Research Center data showing 95% of U.S. teens use social media, and Gallup studies showing that youth use social media frequently and that 41% of high-frequency social media users report having “poor or very poor mental health,” with the percentage higher for teens who use it with low parental monitoring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Reclaiming Childhood Task Force will drive collaboration and innovation to address this mental health crisis and ensure our children grow up with the tools they need to thrive,” Kelly wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the cell phone-free guidelines for schools were being developed this past summer, academics noted the adjustment period they would require for students who have grown accustomed to frequent cell phone and social media use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Naff, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor with a concentration in educational psychology, said in an interview at the time that he hoped the policy would help youth become more intentional about when they use their devices outside of school hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s human nature to crave social interaction, Naff said, “whether we realize it or not” and  social media interactions are less personal than face-to-face interactions. He also noted how research points to increased device use and social media access contributes to anxiety and other mental health issues in today’s younger generations  — research also cited in Yougnkin’s order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naff also noted still-emerging research on the effect the COVID-19 pandemic had on kids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the virus first plagued the globe roughly four years ago and triggered  shutdowns of public life, education  pivoted to virtual learning for a time. This meant youth were on screens more than ever before while missing out on the personal interactions of in-person learning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s kind of hard to distinguish the COVID mental health impacts from the cell phone use mental health impacts, because they&#8217;re overlapping. When schools were closed, our world just moved online,” Naff said. “So then, adolescents are using devices and social media more frequently at that point. Someone could argue that the mental health impacts were related to COVID — which they were —  but you could also say ‘maybe at least a portion of the mental health impacts were that we&#8217;re just on our devices constantly, like to the point of addiction.’”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 22,000 residents across the counties Carroll, Grayson, Scott, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington, Wise and Wythe are likely able to claim the benefit, according to a recent USDA release announcing the special SNAP eligibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States Department of Agriculture makes D-SNAP benefits available in the aftermath of disasters to people who may not be eligible for SNAP in normal circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“USDA is committed to making sure that families, farmers and communities impacted by recent hurricanes get the support they need, including help with grocery expenses as people grapple with significant disruption to their lives,”Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in the release. “The Biden-Harris Administration, including USDA, will do everything in our power to help you respond, recover and rebuild – no matter how long it takes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though current SNAP households aren’t eligible for D-SNAP, the USDA has approved Virginia to automatically issue supplemental SNAP benefits to current SNAP households in Carroll, Grayson, Scott, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington, and Wythe Counties, the release stated. The release also outlined that SNAP households in Wise County may “request supplemental benefits from their state SNAP agency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday’s D-SNAP announcement follows previous federal assistance and state-level efforts in Virginia and other affected states. The U.S. Department of Transportation has already </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/federal-government-sends-virginia-10-million-for-route-58-repair-after-hurricane-helene-washout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sent $10 million to Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “restore and reopen” damaged parts of Route 58 near Washington County. Gov. Glenn Younkgin has also repeatedly </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/14/youngkin-urges-hurricane-helene-survivors-to-contact-officials-shares-storm-recovery-update/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">encouraged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> affected Virginians to apply for federal aid funding as the state has set up disaster recovery centers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter obtained by Virginia Mercury, Youngkin has also requested $4.4 billion in additional funding from the federal government. He sent a letter to President Joe Biden on Nov. 15 along with a copy to President-elect Donald Trump and leadership in the U.S. House and Senate appropriations committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While this office continues to work collaboratively with our partners at all levels</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the severity of these impacts highlights the significant need for accelerated federal support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Youngkin wrote. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the urgent need for action, I respectfully request your administration&#8217;s assistance in prioritizing federal disaster supplemental funding to support Virginia&#8217;s recovery needs.”</span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced Monday that he will seek reelection in 2025, putting to rest speculation that he might enter the Republican primary for governor. His decision effectively clears the way for Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears to secure her party’s nomination for the state’s top job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I serve as the people’s protector,” Miyares said of his role as the state’s top lawyer in an </span><a href="https://x.com/JasonMiyaresVA/status/1858570888251404777" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcing his reelection campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlighting his aspirations for another four years as attorney general, Miyares pointed to key public safety initiatives he has championed, including the “One Pill Can Kill” campaign to raise awareness about fentanyl overdoses and his office’s work with “Ceasefire Virginia,” a program that combines prosecution efforts with community engagement to combat crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Miyares </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/article_2b71d3a4-e6d7-11ee-8831-93f7ac7b8121.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrated crime reductions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> associated with the initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ campaign launch comes roughly a week after Democratic candidate </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/12/former-virginia-delegate-jay-jones-launches-second-bid-for-attorney-general/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Jones announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his latest bid for the position. Jones lost a Democratic primary to former Attorney General Mark Herring in 2021, who later went on to lose to Miyares later that year in the general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Miyares hadn’t officially announced yet, Jones took a jab at Miyares last week — accusing him of using his office to “attack Virginians’ freedoms, pander to the fringes of his own party and side with corporate price gougers and polluters” at the cost of Virginia families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moments after Miyares’ announcement, Gov. Glenn Youngkin also turned to X to endorse the attorney general and Earle-Sears for next year’s Republican ticket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As attorney general, Jason vigorously defends the laws of the commonwealth, stands with law enforcement every single day while leading our shared fight to end the free flow of opioids and fentanyl into our communities, and has been a constant advocate for victims of human trafficking and domestic violence,” Youngkin wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He has never backed down when it comes to standing up for Virginians. He is an exceptional attorney general.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also hailed Earle-Sears — a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/06/lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-announces-run-for-virginia-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared her bid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s highest office in September and would likely face U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger — as “an outstanding” lieutenant governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She will be a great governor. She has been an outspoken advocate for commonsense conservative principles and policies, a passionate voice for our military and veterans, and a relentless advocate for educational freedom and economic opportunity. She brings the fighting spirit of a Marine to the office every single day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earle-Sears said in a statement that she was “deeply honored” to receive Youngkin’s endorsement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Together with our outstanding attorney general, Jason Miyares, we will continue championing common-sense safety and security policies that keep Virginia the ‘Number 1 Best State for Business,’” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Miyares is so far the only Republican candidate vying for the seat, Jones will face Henrico Commonwealth Attorney Shannon Taylor in a primary. Miyares took aim at both on social media last week after Jones announced his bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both of the announced (democratic) candidates for Attorney General are far-left, anti-police, criminal rights progressives who will make Virginia less safe. They will support the same criminal first, victim last policies that lead to a surge in violent crime,” Miyares wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reiterated similar messaging in his re-election campaign launch video Monday, and said that in a second term he will continue to press for more tough-on-crime policies. Also during his time in office, Miyares has signed onto legal briefs with other Republican attorneys general </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/03/virginia-attorney-general-joins-efforts-to-fight-back-against-title-ix-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden administration’s </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/08/01/biden-titleix-courts-gender-identity-discrimination/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title IX rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meant to protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her pushback to Miyares, Taylor noted her over 25 years of experience as a prosecutor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every day of every one of those years has been spent working with law enforcement to keep people safe and seeking justice for victims of crime and their families,” </span><a href="https://x.com/ShannonTaylorVA/status/1856481762563465512" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she wrote on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a repost of Miyares’ post. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Democratic Party of Virginia Chair Susan Swecker in a statement called Miyares “a MAGA mouthpiece in pushing an extreme agenda,” referring to President-elect Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign motto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians deserve an attorney general who will stand up for their rights and freedoms, not someone who is constantly trying to take them away,” Swecker said. “It is clear that, if re-elected, Miyares would use his office as a partisan tool to serve the interests of the Trump administration, rather than the needs of hard-working Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said it was “a smart move” by Miyares to put his gubernatorial ambitions on hold and run for reelection next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was no guarantee that he would prevail in a contest with the lieutenant governor. He can run for reelection now and legitimately claim the right to be first in line in 2029 for the party&#8217;s gubernatorial nomination,” Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Republican attorneys general end up running for governor consistently and sometimes have been able to prevail over Republican lieutenant governors because they are more explicitly conservative, that is not the case this time, Farnsworth said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current lieutenant governor is not an ideological moderate the way some Republican lieutenant governors have been in the past,” he said of Earle-Sears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats would likely have preferred a competition for the GOP’s gubernatorial nomination among the two Republican statewide office holders, Farnsworth added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If nothing else, a fight between Miyares and Winsome Earle-Sears would have put a lot of Republican money into the primary that otherwise would have been spent on a general election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connor Joseph, a spokesman for Spanberger’s campaign, said that no matter who her eventual opponent is, the Democrat’s vision for Virginia remains the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her 2025 campaign will continue to be focused on the priorities that all Virginians share — stronger schools, safer communities, and lower costs,” Joseph said. “Additionally, Abigail knows that Virginia must have a governor who is committed to protecting the rights and fundamental freedoms of all Virginians.”</span></p>

A shortage of new homes is driving continued high housing costs, casting doubt on Virginia's future growth. (Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia will help fund housing construction near major business developments, Gov. Glenn Younkgin announced this week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new executive order, on the heels of an announcement about a major manufacturing development near Danville, sets a goal of investing $75 million towards localities that want to bolster housing supply tied to new job creation over the next five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The private sector is ready to step in and meet the needs of our growing workforce with much needed workforce housing,” Youngkin said in a release announcing his order. “(This) announcement advances these efforts by accelerating workforce housing development and requiring local governments to support the housing growth that Virginia needs.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the funding will fuel housing supply</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a shortage of about 200,000 affordable housing units and a housing demand of about 4 million units overall, according to a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/landing-2021-affordable-housing-in-virginia.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and state government </span><a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/byline/department-of-housing-and-community-development/#:~:text=Virginia%20has%20a%20housing%20supply,according%20to%20the%20executive%20order." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the new investments aim to help foster construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin anticipates his new order can help create about 5,000 units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO---42---Catalyzing-Housing-Development-for-Critical-Workforce-and-Economic-Development-Needs-with-Interagency-Collaboration.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 42</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Workforce Housing Investment Program will consist of loans, subsidies and grants for localities and nonprofits to develop new housing near new employers in regions of the state. It also states that localities planning to tap into the Virginia Business Ready Sites Program will need to provide housing plans to demonstrate how they can accommodate job growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such example could be near the Berry Hill megasite in Pittsylvania County, which spans over 3,500 acres near Danville and has emerged as a development-ready site that could attract companies to the area. Ahead of Youngkin’s workforce housing announcement, Tennessee-based Microporous </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/14/how-big-is-the-microporous-announcement-here-are-11-ways/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a battery plant at the location that is slated to provide over 2,000 jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, said in an interview this summer that he anticipated the area could be ripe for tapping into various funding opportunities to address the conflation of job growth and housing strains. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Macaulay Porter, a deputy communications director for the governor, noted that while the funding is going to be available statewide, “localities with the highest imbalance of job growth to housing” stand to benefit the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysis from the state’s housing department has indicated that feature typically applies to areas in Southwest Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission had also announced a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/workforce-housing-pilot-launches-to-support-southern-and-southwestern-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workforce housing funding program </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">over the summer. That pilot program has about $2 million in its coffers to disperse to applicants on a rolling basis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia Housing and Community Development study from 2022 noted how the state’s </span><a href="https://dmz1.dhcd.virginia.gov/HB854/pdf/hb854-full-report-print.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fastest growing regions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the previous decade were  Northern Virginia, the Northern Shenandoah Valley and central Virginia’s Richmond. Conversely, rural areas of the state saw job losses. Those numbers could change in future census data as economic developments in rural areas attract or retain populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of her district entails urban areas, Sen. Lashresce Aird, D-Petersburg, previously told The Mercury that she anticipates rural portions of her district could benefit from workforce and housing development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Housing continues to be a big strain on how we’re going to get workers to come here,” she said. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2025 legislative session on the horizon, lawmakers will continue to work on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various other housing proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — ranging from preserving existing affordable housing to rental assistance or protections, to support for ways localities can tap into federal housing development funds. </span></strong></p>

(Courtesy of Flock Safety)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State lawmakers are debating whether to regulate law enforcement departments’ use of Automated License Plate Readers (ALPR). They heard  constituents’ perspectives on the technology and reviewed studies from the Virginia State Crime Commission at a meeting in Richmond on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ALPRs are typically mounted cameras (but can also be dashboard cameras) that capture a photograph or video clip of a vehicle and its license plate along with the location, date and time of the capture. The technology has grown in popularity across the country in both public and private sector use — from </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/crime-suburbs-license-plate-readers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homeowner associations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and businesses to </span><a href="https://www.29news.com/2024/09/23/flock-cameras-put-use-charlottesville/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law enforcement </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">agencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Thursday’s </span><a href="https://vscc.virginia.gov/2024/Nov14mtg/Presentation%20-VSCC%20ALPR.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the commission&#8217;s deputy director Colin Drabert outlined a study and feedback from unnamed “stakeholders.” Their responses, he said, reflected that there are numerous benefits as well as concerns surrounding law enforcement using the technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Few rigorous studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of ALPR,” he said. “However, the studies that have been conducted have shown that ALPR is particularly effective in assisting law enforcement with locating stolen vehicles and investigating other offenses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also noted the stakeholders’ concern that camera placement in minority communities “would result in disparate impacts to the residents of those communities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Criminal Justice Services is in the process of determining how many Virginia law enforcement agencies are already using ALPR — information that will be available “in the near future,” Drabert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 18 states currently regulate the use of ALPRs and 17 of them also regulate the length of time that law enforcement can retain data. For instance, New Hampshire allows for three minutes while Alabama allows for up to five years. Several states range from a few weeks to a few months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though law enforcement agencies can share data with other public and private entities that use ALPR, Drabert stressed multiple times that ALPR alone does not reveal people’s identities. He said that law enforcement has to access separate databases to determine who owns a vehicle that was flagged by the technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drabert explained that law enforcement that uses ALPR receives alerts for “hot list” features like stolen vehicles or license plates, vehicles associated with people known to be potentially engaged in criminal activity and vehicles associated with missing people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville police chief Michael Kochis made a case for using ALPRs during public comment and said that some community members in his community had been asking for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that “people whose homes were being shot up on a weekly basis” kept asking “when are we going to get it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Charlottesville’s city council approved  the installation of Flock Safety Cameras — a leading ALPR company in America — following a series of community meetings that garnered mixed feedback from residents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But common concerns that have emerged in Virginia and nationwide amid the rise in ALPR use have been privacy and prevention of unreasonable searches and seizures by governments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norfolk residents recently filed a federal </span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/in-the-community/norfolk/new-lawsuit-challenges-whether-flock-cameras-in-norfolk-are-constitutional" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenging the use of Flock cameras, alleging that they violate people’s Fourth Amendment rights — which protect against unreasonable searches and seizures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drabert noted cases where ALPR use resulted in erroneous searches, such as when a mother and children in Colorado were </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/08/955165485/no-charges-for-colorado-officers-who-held-black-children-at-gunpoint" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held at gunpoint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after being wrongly suspected of being in a stolen car. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal Aid Justice Center attorney Ruby Cherian asked lawmakers to consider “guardrails” for law enforcements’ use of the technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Officers should be required to get a warrant to search the database to protect privacy rights and prevent misuse and abuse,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick, asked if a 30-day limit on data storage would be reasonable. Cherian agreed, though she said she’d like to see a shorter cutoff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crime commission will meet again on Dec. 16, when Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, said some decisions can be made on how to move forward with potential regulations. After Thursday’s meeting, Herring said that she wants to read through documents stemming from the presentation and analyze other information and cases regarding ALPR use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think something needs to be in place,” she said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC, which conducted the study the report is based on, and VDH commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton attributed some of the departments’ issues to the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020 and 2021, before Shelton joined VDH, the department had to place much of its focus on the state’s response to the global pandemic. Additional contractor staff were brought on board to help with things like contact tracing and vaccine rollout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash forward to 2024, and JLARC identified that the department was over-reliant on contractors in lieu of permanent staff positions, with contract employees making up over a third of the department’s workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveys also found that staff felt inadequately trained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid staffing turnover, the report also outlined a “protracted and inefficient process of prolonged hiring, leading to unfilled vacancies,” said JLARC analyst Drew Dickinson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Anne Ferrell Tata, R-Virginia Beach, asked if the overall healthcare industry workforce shortages that have been affecting Virginia were a factor in the vacancy issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickinson said VDH is still actively posting jobs but the process is “just taking too long and it’s causing these issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, the average duration for hiring lasted about 100 days (roughly a third of a year), so over 400 qualified applicants had moved onto other job opportunities, according to Dickinson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that a third of staff surveyed felt there was little accountability for people’s job performances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lack of accountability is contributing to low morale and high turnover,” Dickinson said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond staffing, the department’s challenges include  financial management, a process VDH relies on to secure numerous federal grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After repeated issues procuring one from the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, the federal agency decided to no longer dispense it up front to Virginia’s health department. Now the department has to front the cash for related expenses and then seek reimbursement from the EPA in lieu of a traditional grant funding format. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also noted numerous incidents of delayed and duplicate payments to vendors, and that VDH has struggled to pay its bills promptly. This has created backlogs for other state agencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tata called the report “sobering” while Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, referred to it as “shocking” and “disturbing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC study went on to outline over 30 recommendations for how VDH can better function. Suggestions include the state legislature funding recruitment positions that can help scout and hire permanent staff in the department, and establishing a requirement that the commissioner report on progress of implementing recommendations semi-annually to the Joint Subcommittee on Health and Human Resources Oversight through December 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dickinson agreed, and said VDH’s issues “warrant attention from the state legislature, at least temporarily.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another suggestion is for Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office to direct the Office of the State Inspector General to assign waste, fraud and abuse hotline investigations relating to VDH to its own staff, rather than VDH’s internal audit staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for Youngkin did not answer when asked if the governor would take the OSIG recommendation but did stress the efforts that have already been underway to help resolve VDH’s issues. One such example was the appointment of VDH’s chief operating officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Through proper management review and oversight, the VDH team has already made significant progress to address many issues within the JLARC report,” press secretary Christian Martinez said in a text Thursday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commissioner Shelton presented an optimistic follow up to the JLARC report, confirming actions the department has already taken to course correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After starting as commissioner in the summer of 2023, Shelton  noted that she oversaw the creation of regional health director roles to “increase communication and accountability across health districts.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelton explained that VDH is placing emphasis on filling vacancies in financial and human resources divisions as well as the internal audit team. Shelton also created the Office of Grants Management specifically to take point on the grants VDH relies on. Additionally, a reshuffling in the department assigned a chief financial officer to oversee finances. She added that Chief Operation Officer Christopher Lindsey has been leading frequent operating reviews since joining the agency in late 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are rebuilding a culture of accountability,” Shelton said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican officials in Virginia celebrated the former president’s national victory, hailing it as a mandate for their party’s agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The American people have spoken overwhelmingly to return common sense, strength, and leadership back to the White House. Through the Trump presidency, we will pave the way for an economic revival, a secure border, and a stronger America on the world stage,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin did not comment on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/harris-triumphs-over-trump-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’s victory in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Democrat defeated Trump by a 5-point margin, winning 51.8% to Trump’s 46.5%, a spread of nearly 225,000 votes from a total of about 4.3 million cast, according to unofficial data from the Virginia Department of Elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump claimed victory nationwide by securing 292 electoral votes to Harris’s 224, also winning the popular vote by a 4.8 million margin — the first Republican nominee to do so since President George W. Bush won reelection in 2004.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats, on the other hand, remained largely silent in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday’s election.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Oyna2sSBD2"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/harris-triumphs-over-trump-in-virginia/">Harris triumphs over Trump in Virginia</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the few party leaders to address Virginians directly within hours after the Associated Press </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/06/dc/ap-former-president-donald-trump-wins-second-term/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called the race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Trump was Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who despite the Democrats’ defeat in the race for the White House and the U.S. Senate expressed optimism about his state and how Democrats and Republicans can work together at the state level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All politics are local, and I think we&#8217;ve begun to see that here in Virginia,” Scott told reporters outside the state capital in Richmond on Wednesday afternoon. “I think Virginians expect us to do everything that we can to protect their freedoms, and then to work where we can, with the governor and with the federal government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in reference to some voter demographics and polarizing factors about Trump as a candidate, he said “I think we learned some lessons about what’s acceptable and unacceptable for whole lot of American people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and activists have continually stressed concern over Trump’s rhetoric that often disparages people of color, immigrants and women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the country made a bet on Donald Trump that some of the things that he has said he didn’t mean, and they’re going to trust him,” Scott said. “I hope they’re right, because we want him to be successful, because it’s good for the entire country.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy was “a huge issue” during the 2024 election cycle, Scott added as a reason some Virginia voters turned to Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think inflation is real. There are people who still feel some pain around inflation. Even though inflation is down, prices are down, we’re back moving in the right direction… I think that that message didn’t resonate with voters, and I think that ended up hurting us at some point,” he said. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40738" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_3713/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-40738 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_3713-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_3713-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_3713-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_3713-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_3713-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_3713-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_3713-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth speaks to members of the media on Nov. 6, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., whose seat was not up for reelection this year, said that he was committed to “working with President-elect Trump to get things done for Virginians, just as I did during his first term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Americans made their choice on Tuesday, and while it wasn’t my favored candidate, I respect the democratic process and the outcome of this election,” Warner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Democratic leaders had anticipated a strong showing for Harris in the state, but her smaller-than-expected margin of victory reflects a shift in Virginia’s political landscape, particularly in rural areas that saw increased GOP turnout, political analysts say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia and nationally, red areas became more red and blue areas became less blue nearly everywhere,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s obvious liabilities — his felony convictions, his chaotic administration and rhetoric driven by his white-hot anger — didn’t seem to matter to voters who were in a mood to reject the status quo, Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the commonwealth, where abortion was protected by existing state law, the abortion issue was less relevant. In a number of states where abortion was on the ballot, abortion measures were far more popular than the Democratic candidates who supported them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And voters were clearly unhappy with the Biden administration&#8217;s record, particularly as it related to economic anxiety, the border and racial and cultural politics, Farnsworth added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The national dimensions of this frustration were seen in all areas — nearly everywhere we saw that Harris won by less or lost by more than Biden did four years ago.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Republicans hailed Trump’s victory as a win for the commonwealth while remaining silent on the former president’s defeat in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said in a statement that Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will return to Washington with “a clear mandate” from the American people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across Virginia, and indeed the entire nation, voters shifted to the right in record numbers. Working class Americans stood up and said they&#8217;re tired of being told the economy is fine, and that they should just buy off brand peanut butter to deal with inflation,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groups long “taken for granted by the left” rejected claims that their schools are fine and their children are safe in their communities, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tens of millions of Americans decided they’d had enough of being called Nazis for simply having a different political opinion. Americans will no longer ignore what they can see right in front of them, no matter how much Democrats insist that reality is wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party, said that he was pleased with the results both nationally and in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re obviously pleased with the national race, the American people have spoken and President Trump has been reelected to a second term,” Anderson said in a phone interview Wednesday. “Here in Virginia, he did not carry it, but we worked very hard and took the 10.1% lead that Biden had in 2020 and shaved it down to just under 6% this year. I feel very good about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the “swings of the party pendulums” happen in a revolutionary way, Anderson added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s usually evolutionary, and we’re now in the process of trying to take that pendulum and swing it as far and as fast as possible back toward the right.” </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Republicans, however, limited their post-election commentary to social media, offering a mix of reflection and Monday-morning quarterbacking with a hint of ridicule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It looks like over 300 electoral votes, the popular vote, taking the Senate and keeping the House, and gosh, who could have predicted that calling over half of the country a bunch of bigoted misogynists if they didn’t vote for your candidate wasn’t a good campaign strategy? Who could have predicted that?” Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, a social media influencer, told his 1.3 million Instagram followers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCCJJQ7uY4z/?igsh=MWN3MnV3MjQyZWFkbw==" target="_blank">in a video</a> he posted Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, state Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, asked for suggestions for “some of the action items for Virginia as we move forward” from the 2024 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Identify the 200k Virginia Biden voters who didn’t show up for Harris. Figure out what’s going on with some of the pollsters that appear to have been completely divorced from reality,” Sturtevant listed among his own action items. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Swecker, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, declined to comment Wednesday, stating that she was waiting for Harris to address the American people later on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But DPVA spokeswoman Kelsey Carolan said that Virginia Democrats fared well in the presidential election compared to other eastern states — despite Republican gains across the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolan cited election data from Connecticut, where Trump gained 8.9% of voters compared to 2020, New York (10.6%), New Jersey (10.9%) and Maryland (10.3%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia, Trump currently has a gain of 4.8%” Carolan said. “That is the most apples-to-apples analysis, because all of these states are states where neither campaign spent money on TV ads. This was a wave election and we’ve held our own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few Democratic lawmakers  took their post-election sorrows to social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://x.com/jackie4norfolk/status/1854158831162454269" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lengthy thread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on X, Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, said that Tuesday evening reminded her of the night when Trump was first elected eight years ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She recalled how her then 10-year-old son asked her if his Latino and Hispanic classmates in school might be &#8220;taken away.&#8221; She added that she had once again woken up with a &#8220;familiar sense of dread.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Glass still left her fellow Democrats with a message of hope and optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grab your pen, your pocketbook, your protest sign, your petition, and above all, your purpose. Remember, we are Lovers — no matter who we love, where we’ve been, or how we’ve lived. And if there’s one thing I know as a woman and a mother, it’s this: Lovers make the best fighters. Let’s fight for Virginia. Let’s go.”</span></p>

<p><em>Updated Nov. 6, 6:15 p.m.</em></p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, staved off Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal to win a second term representing Virginia&#8217;s 2nd Congressional District.</p>
<p>With a 4-point sustained lead by nearly 6 p.m on Wednesday, the Associated Press called the race for Kiggans almost 24 hours after polls closed on Election Day.</p>
<p>In a post to X earlier in the day before the race had officially been called in her favor, Kiggans posted that she was grateful her district has &#8220;once again chosen commonsense conservatism.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Together we will get our country back on the right track and secure America’s success,&#8221; she added.</p>
<div>
<p>The Virginia Beach-anchored district has oscillated between political parties in congressional representation in recent years, with former Democratic  Rep. Elaine Luria ousting Republican Rep. Scott Taylor in 2018, followed by Kiggans ousting Luria in 2022. Smasal had hoped to flip the red district back to blue this year.</p>
<p>In addition to Virginia Beach, the district includes Chesapeake, Suffolk, Isle of Wight and Virginia’s Eastern Shore. Though a primary role of congressional representatives includes securing federal funding for local and state government to use, candidates’ plans to address national issues also featured prominently in the election this year, <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1730958278931000&amp;usg=AOvVaw17jleutQiIn5Gup30WVwfH">such as reducing inflation and reproductive rights.</a></p>
<p>A swingy district, the seat was seen as crucial for determining partisan control of the U.S. House of Delegates. Smasal had the <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-congress-smasal-kiggans-hakeem-jeffries/article_955a0eac-d5bc-11ee-99ea-4f07936040ca.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endorsement of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York</a> — likely the next House Speaker should Democrats flip the chamber. Meanwhile, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana came to Virginia to boost Kiggans and she had appeared at a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/">rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump</a> over the summer.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday night, Smasal conceded the race and thanked supporters.</p>
<p>&#8220;To our voters, I’m sorry that we did not win the day, but I’m so thankful for your hard work and support.  I carry your stories and experiences with me every day, and I am grateful for your trust and teamwork throughout this journey,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The countless doors we knocked on, the phone calls we made, and our unwavering commitment to truth and justice in the face of extremism are evidence of our resolve and patriotism.&#8221;</p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynchburg resident Nadra Wilson was trying to be proactive this summer by renewing her driver’s license months ahead of its December expiration. As a longtime voter and Virginia resident of almost a decade, she never suspected she would be removed from the state’s voter rolls due to a paperwork error and caught up in a voter purge program that has booted 1,600 from voter lists and drawn two lawsuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people fail to indicate citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork, or initial a box indicating they&#8217;re not a citizen, that information used to be sent monthly to the Department of Elections to send to local registrars, who sort it out with people. Now, under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s Executive Order 35, that information is sent daily. Registrars send notice to impacted voters, who receive it by mail and are supposed to respond within 14 days of its postmark. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was surprising for Wilson to receive a letter informing her that she had to prove her U.S. citizenship or have her voter registration canceled. It was also frustrating, since  the September-dated notification letter didn’t make it to her until October because it had previously been sent to an older address. By then, she had been purged from voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is all very concerning,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, she was able to go to her local registrar’s office to resolve matters and cast her vote early, but worries that others in her shoes may not have been able to do the same, in light of the ongoing lawsuits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order to ramp up voter data reports from the DMV to the State Department of Elections from monthly to daily fell within a 90-day “quiet period” in the federal National Voter Registration Act law. Two lawsuits challenged this in court.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EpwqKMipfE"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/">U.S. Supreme Court grants stay in challenge to Youngkin’s voter purge order</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;U.S. Supreme Court grants stay in challenge to Youngkin’s voter purge order&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/embed/#?secret=PnDAUxycYH#?secret=EpwqKMipfE" data-secret="EpwqKMipfE" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the lawsuits and civil rights groups stressed that the purges affect both longtime citizens who’d made paperwork errors as well as those who’d become naturalized citizens since their last DMV visit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a federal court granted a preliminary injunction — ordering Youngkin’s administration to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstate purged 1,600 voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and halt continued purges — the United States Supreme Court’s conservative majority </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miayres’ request to block the lower court’s order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County resident Rina Shaw, who’d also been briefly removed from rolls over paperwork errors like Wilson, said the situation has been “worrying for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When obtaining her learner’s permit, she’d forgotten to indicate her citizenship status. After calling her local registrar her registration has been restored because “they said they had made a mistake” and she was able to vote last week, she explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also disagrees with the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the purge case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s like they basically threw out rules,” she said of the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period. “They were just like, you know, ‘to hell with that.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who were caught up in the voter roll purge </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">may utilize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> same-day registration and a provisional ballot to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s what longtime Richmond resident Eric Terrell is going to do, although it won’t be as easy as the mail-in ballot he’d planned for due to his disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though a lifelong Richmonder, he’d moved earlier this year into the senior living facility where he lives now. He’d also updated his address through the DMV and his mistake of not checking the citizenship box is what kicked him off the rolls. When his mail-in ballot never came, he’d reached out to local officials to learn what went wrong. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrell said that he was “highly pissed” when he found out, but he’s come to accept the situation. He plans to take an Uber to his polling location on Election Day and said that he’s grateful same-day registration exists to resolve the matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Wilson didn’t end up needing to take the same-day registration and provisional ballot route, she said that she’s glad others have that option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provisional ballots, another option for same-day registrants, are most often used in instances where someone forgot to bring their ID card or other form of identification, as well as when people utilize same-day voter registration. Virginia Public Access Project also has a tool to </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/local-politics/elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lookup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a polling place based on someone’s address even if they aren’t technically registered yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico County’s registrar Mark Coakley said that in most cases where provisional ballots are used, as long as people are able to show identification they don’t need to follow up with their registrar. Should someone decline the day of or not have identification on them at the time they vote, they can come back to their registrar’s office before noon on Friday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For provisional ballots, he said that registrars are able to research if someone is a citizen in order to count their ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they were canceled or not registered, provisional ballots are a fail-safe method,” Coakley said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, he stressed that anyone voting on Election Day should remember “if you’re in line before 7 p.m., you will get to cast your ballot.”</span></p>

(Samantha Willis/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Justice plans to </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-monitor-polls-27-states-compliance-federal-voting-rights-laws" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitor </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">compliance with federal voting laws in 27 states and 86 jurisdictions nationwide during Tuesday’s general elections. Six of those are in Virginia: Hanover, Henrico, Loudoun, and Prince William counties as well as the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that personnel from the department’s Civil Rights Division “will be available all day to receive questions and complaints … related to possible violations of federal voting rights laws,” according to a Nov. 1 DOJ news release. The agency will also “maintain contact with state and local election officials” throughout Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico’s registrar Mark Coakley said that representatives from the DOJ had reached out late last week to inform his office that officials “would be coming by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They didn’t say (which specific polling places) they were going, just Henrico in general,” he said in a call on Monday. “I expect the DOJ will spend more time at the malls or eating at local restaurants than actually finding anything wrong or out of the ordinary at our polling places.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department is monitoring complaints for possible violations of several laws including the Voting Rights Act, Help America Vote Act, Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, Civil Rights Acts, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the National Voter Registration Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter was central to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month aimed at Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration for a voter purge program that has removed at least </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1,600 people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Virginia voter rolls. A DOJ suit and one from Virginia’s League of Women Voters and Virginia Coalition for Immigrants Rights allege roll purges were happening too close to election day in violation of a 90-day quiet period in the National Voter Registration Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people fail to indicate citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork, that information is sent monthly to the Department of Elections to send to local registrars, who sort it out with people. But an Aug. 5 executive order from Youngkin — at the start of the 90-day quiet period —  ramped up the reporting from monthly to daily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the case and civil rights groups stressed that the purges affect both longtime citizens who’d made paperwork errors as well as people who’d become naturalized citizens since their last DMV visit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a federal court granted a preliminary injunction — ordering Youngkin’s administration to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reinstate purged 1,600 voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and halt continued purges — the United States Supreme Court’s conservative majority </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miayres’ request to block the lower court’s order. </span></p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For reports of potential violation of federal voting rights laws, reports may be made through the department’s website </span><a href="http://www.civilrights.justice.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.civilrights.justice.gov</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by calling toll-free at 800-253-3931.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://www.msv.org/programs/apal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Adult Psychiatric Access Line</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dubbed APAL, is a resource for providers to better cater to the needs of their patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Primary care providers who connect with the program will be directed to regional hub operators to provide intake information for patients battling addiction, to help them access other resources and mental health professionals or social workers that specialize in addiction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deltaville-area doctor Sterling Ransone said it’s a needed resource for  primary care physicians statewide and will allow them to offer better care to their patients.. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem we get is that we don’t have the psychiatric and behavioral health resources in our office or right next door,” he said. “It’s nice to be able to have some backup.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBHS Commissioner Nelson Smith explained that Virginia has a shortage of mental healthcare workers. This means that potential patients can sometimes struggle to navigate finding a therapist who can help them talk through solutions or a psychiatrist who can prescribe medications for those who need it. People may also wait months to schedule appointments, due to these challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith said primary care providers like Ransone can be a first point of help in many cases because patients may have already established trust with their PCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People might go in for a sprained ankle and end up divulging more,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though PCPs have training across multiple types of care, the Adult Psychiatric Access Line can help them connect patients with substance disorders to other specialists. PCPs can also receive additional educational support to better be able to prescribe medications when that form of therapy is needed to treat addiction disease. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransone recalled how one of his patients was a single mother coping with addiction while juggling work and motherhood. She used to have to wake up very early to drive more than an hour in order to receive the methadone that she needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">APAL will allow more local doctors to be able and comfortable with prescribing medications like methadone so patients like his wouldn’t have to travel as far in their daily lives for treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meeting patients where they are more often can prevent some people from needing to go to the emergency room and ultimately prevent addiction-related deaths, Smith said. In 2022, there were over 22,000 ER visits stemming from substance use disorders and over 2,400 such deaths, </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/drug-overdose-data/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20there%20were%3A&amp;text=2%2C490%20drug%20overdose%20deaths%20among,a%205%25%20decrease%20from%202021.&amp;text=Almost%20eight%20out%20of%2010,%2C%20fentanyl%20analogs%2C%20and%20tramadol." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Department of Health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith pointed to how the resource hub launch stems from the </span><a href="https://www.hhr.virginia.gov/12-14-2022-Two-Page-BH-Plan-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Help Right Now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative that Gov. Glenn Youngkin has spearheaded. Virginia is in the second year of Youngkin’s three-year plan, which entails budget proposals from him and legislative actions by state lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A national survey from this year found that 38% of Americans think mental health isn’t adequately treated, but </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/about-38-of-americans-think-mental-health-isnt-adequately-treated-va-s-working-to-change-that/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is working to change that</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and model solutions.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="J2E085l2dR"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/about-38-of-americans-think-mental-health-isnt-adequately-treated-va-s-working-to-change-that/">About 38% of Americans think mental health isn&#8217;t adequately treated.

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;About 38% of Americans think mental health isn&#8217;t adequately treated. Va.&#8217;s working to change that.&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/10/about-38-of-americans-think-mental-health-isnt-adequately-treated-va-s-working-to-change-that/embed/#?secret=Z54nSs5cFM#?secret=J2E085l2dR" data-secret="J2E085l2dR" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransone also noted a synergy between federal and state government when it comes to helping out. Bipartisan legislation from 2021 called the</span><a href="https://tonko.house.gov/uploadedfiles/mat_act_fact_sheet_117th.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Mainlining Addiction Treatment Act,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eliminated a waiver requirement that had prevented some physicians from being able to prescribe a type of opioid addiction treatment. This, in part, helps make APAL possible in Virginia for doctors like him.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith pointed to the building blocks the Medical Society of Virginia already had in place that paved the way for APAL. The new program for adults is modeled after the society’s state and federally-funded </span><a href="https://vmap.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mental Health Access Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which PCPs can use to support pediatric patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while APAL is focused specifically on substance use disorders for now, Nelson and MSV CEO Melina Davis said there are plans to expand it in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransone said he’s already thinking about how the program may benefit his patients and potential future patients who struggle with things like bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or depression and anxiety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We decided to start with substance abuse and then eventually we&#8217;ll expand into (more) mental health care,” Davis said.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin’s executive order that resulted in the removal of over 6,000 Virginians from the state’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stay pauses a lower court’s ruling that would have required the state to restore 1,600 voters to the rolls, allowing Youngkin’s directive to remain in effect and voter removals to continue as the case proceeds. The high court’s decision drew praise from Youngkin and laments from the voter rights groups suing him and the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s six conservative justices supported the stay, with the three liberals dissenting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin in a statement hailed the court’s decision as “a victory for commonsense and election fairness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am grateful for the work of Attorney General Jason Miyares on this critical fight to protect the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. Clean voter rolls are one important part of a comprehensive approach we are taking to ensure the fairness of our elections,” Youngkin said, adding that the ruling would ensure a secure election on Nov. 5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians can cast their ballots on Election Day knowing that Virginia’s elections are fair, secure, and free from politically-motivated interference,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order comes after the Virginia Republican Party filed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday supporting Youngkin’s efforts, arguing that removing noncitizens from the voter rolls should not be delayed due to the federally mandated “quiet period” — a buffer period around elections meant to avoid disruptions to voter records. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican brief argues that the governor’s order was based on data from the Department of Motor Vehicles and focused on noncitizens, and thus does not constitute a “systematic” voter purge restricted by the quiet period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opposition to the order has come from various groups, including former GOP lawmakers such as Barbara Comstock, Denver Riggleman, and Adam Kinzinger, who filed </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330589/20241029151116178_333985%20Amicus%20on%20Application.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a separate brief </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">urging the Supreme Court to deny the stay. They argue that hastily removing voters could lead to eligible citizens losing their rights, citing concerns over the potential exclusion of legitimate voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares and Youngkin’s administration maintain that the executive order is a necessary step for election security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement released Wednesday, Miyares called the Supreme Court ruling a win for election integrity and the rule of law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While I am gratified the court moved so quickly, I remain deeply concerned and alarmed that the Biden-Harris administration chose to execute this maneuver just 25 days before an election,” he said of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed earlier this month by the Justice Department that challenges Youngkin’s executive order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics, however — including the Virginia Center for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters’s Virginia chapter, who are suing Youngkin and the state — argue that the purge risks disenfranchising Virginians and disproportionately impacts minority voters, calling the move part of a larger trend of restrictive voting policies. Representatives of the groups and their lawyers said they were “disappointed” with the Supreme Court’s decision in a virtual press conference held Wednesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Snow, counsel with the Lawyers Committee For Civil Rights Under Law, called the decision by the nation’s highest court an “abuse of power.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bert Bayou with African Communities Together said that the state’s and high court’s actions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are &#8220;sending a disturbing message that (immigrant’s) voices are not valued, not wanted, and not American.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are living in a political climate that is fanning the flames of xenophobia,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orion Danjuma, counsel with Protect Democracy, noted how a similar situation was also recently settled in Alabama. A federal judge </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/10/16/federal-judge-blocks-alabama-secretary-of-states-voter-removal-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocked </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama’s voter roll purge program after the Department of Justice had filed a similar suit last month as it did to Virginia. When Virginia requested its stay to the U.S. Supreme Court, Alabama’s Attorney General </span><a href="https://www.alabamaag.gov/alabama-joins-25-state-coalition-urging-u-s-supreme-court-to-grant-emergency-motion-so-virginia-is-not-forced-to-add-noncitizens-to-its-voter-rolls/#:~:text=(Montgomery%2C%20Ala)%20%E2%80%93%20Alabama,rolls%20for%20the%20upcoming%20election." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed onto an amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of the request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danjuma stressed that the programs “disenfranchise eligible voters” and that organizations like his will continue to challenge them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While this is a serious setback to voters for this election, we want to make clear that we will be continuing to expose problems with the state&#8217;s program so that they can be corrected in the future,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State lawmakers react</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s statehouse leaders shared a variety of responses to the news on Wednesday, reflecting both support for SCOTUS’ decision and dismay due to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who has been outspoken in his opposition to Youngkin’s executive order, posted to X that the stay SCOTUS granted “does not equal a win.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, The Governor&#8217;s scheme to block legal eligible (Virginia) voters has temporarily worked. It&#8217;s a sad day for the Commonwealth and the country,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, state Sen. John McGuire, a member of the body’s Privileges and Elections subcommittee and a candidate for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District seat, commended the Youngkin administration for &#8220;leading the charge to keep our elections secure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “This is simple: noncitizens shouldn’t be able to vote, and I’m glad the Supreme Court agrees,&#8221; McGuire stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach had written a letter to Commissioner of Elections Susan Beals on Sep. 27, seeking more information on how the removals were handled under Youngkin’s Aug. 7 executive order and whether non-citizens were facing prosecution for attempting to register.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his letter Rouse referenced a Fox News </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6360067628112" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin did the day of his executive order where he claimed that his order would lead to “immediate” removal of people and subsequent prosecution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse asked Beals if registrars were referring people to commonwealth&#8217;s attorneys. In her Oct. 8 response to Rouse, Beals did not answer whether registrars had referred non-citizens to local prosecutors.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DoFiHerc2c"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/">Over 1,600 people removed from voter rolls under Youngkin order; groups seek court injunction</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the case against the state argue there has been no evidence of people being prosecuted for attempting to vote illegally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have tried to get straight answers from this Administration,” Rouse said Wednesday. “It took the U.S. Department of Justice filing suit and a federal judge forcing the Youngkin administration to disclose the names of those removed and confirm what we feared: that in fact eligible Virginia voters have been stripped from the rolls.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that he and members of his committee will “work to ensure that these disenfranchised voters are educated as to the procedures for casting a valid provisional ballot.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the situation could mean for Virginia voters, on Election Day and beyond</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the stay in place, the case is likely to continue drawing national attention as the election nears, spotlighting debates over voting rights, citizenship and electoral integrity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could also lead to confusion at the polls next Tuesday, because it remains unclear what information voters who have been purged would need to show for same-day registration, said Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The administration is claiming that there is sufficient evidence to knock someone off the rolls. If that’s true, and if a registrar has said this person shouldn’t be on the roll, I’m not sure what kind of information would convince the registrar that the person should be on the rolls and should have their provisional ballot counted. And that’s a tricky issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers added that it also remains unclear what the Supreme Court ruling means for the federal </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters of Virginia earlier this month which alleges that the process used to purge the rolls violates the 90-day quiet period and therefore disenfranchises eligible voters while raising concerns over transparency and accuracy in the state’s voter registration system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In theory, the case goes back to the drawing board and you need to run it as a sort of a regular merits case as opposed to just an injunction case. But the problem with that is that the point of the case is that the 90-day quiet period is going to be over once election day is done,” Chambers said. “Then the question becomes, is the purge program in and of itself unlawful in general?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some state lawmakers have signaled they are ready to tackle that question, and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/should-legislators-tweak-virginias-2006-voter-roll-law-for-more-clarity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that undergirds it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell County, said in a phone interview Wednesday that in the 2025 legislative session, he would “be open to looking at anything” in the 2006 law that would limit potential confusion at the polls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bottom line is, if you are a U.S. citizen, we want you to vote, it’s your right and duty to vote,” said Hackworth, a member of the Senate Privileges &amp; Election who was “very disheartened” when the lower court ruled to halt Youngkin’s order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any among the affected 1,600 Virginians believe they have been removed from the voter rolls in error, Hackworth urged them to still cast a provisional ballot bringing documentation proving their citizenship status and let the local electoral board “figure that out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that maybe we are kind of overcomplicating this process, because anybody still has the right on the day of to say, ‘I have been purged from the voter rolls, I am a citizen of the United States, and I want to vote.’ If you have that much conviction to go to the polls and vote provisional, you will bring something that’s going to back up your claim that you are a citizen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation has raised questions on whether state lawmakers should consider amending that law for additional clarity and to avoid future legal disputes over how Virginia confirms voter registration shortly before elections. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The 2006 law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has said repeatedly that his executive order was built on a 2006 state law for voter roll cleanups, which directs the Department of Motor Vehicles to send data to the State Board of Elections of people who failed to indicate U.S. citizenship in paperwork. There’s a process of notification and then purging of voters who fail to prove their citizenship, and in previous years, the process was done on a monthly basis. Youngkin’s order directed DMV and Elections Department officials to perform it daily.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuits the state and Youngkin face say Youngkin’s order ran afoul of the National Voter Registration Act, which institutes a “quiet period” on such actions 90 days before an election. Several state lawmakers have signaled they agree with that allegation, including House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Mercury “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason that we have this 90-day rule is that we don’t want citizens to be accidentally removed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privileges and Elections Committee chair Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, called Youngkin’s order “reckless” and alleged that it’s being used to “fire up the (Republican) base.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you actually look at the issue of the matter, it’s the 90-day quiet period,” Rouse said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The courts will decide the matter concerning the legal challenges, John Aughenbaugh, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he added that the Youngkin administration “brought this on themselves” by issuing the order so close to the 90-day federal threshold.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aughenbaugh said, “I can understand why <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/">Youngkin told Fox News</a> ‘we didn’t think we were doing anything wrong,’” in citing the 2006 law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That measure was carried by former republican state Sen. Ken Cucinelli and signed by former Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine. At that time, Republican President George Bush’s Department of Justice had issued a memo that it didn’t object to the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the time since, no one has challenged it, until the two suits against Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An argument in Attorney General Jason </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330363/20241027231346621_Application%20for%20Stay%20SCOTUS%20vpf.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ Supreme Court filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes confusion on when the federal 90-day law should overpower the 2006 state law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current confusion surrounding the NVRA makes the rules anything but clear,” Miyares’ petition reads. “States are unaware of when, or whether, they can remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. They need to know with certainty whether they can remove noncitizens at any point, only outside of the Quiet Period, or never.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the Republican National Committee and Republican Party of Virginia also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of the state’s SCOTUS request.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PT197hFPSU"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/">Virginia GOP calls on U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate Youngkin’s voter purge order</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia GOP calls on U.S. Supreme Court to reinstate Youngkin’s voter purge order&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/embed/#?secret=Qu8rSVbz84#?secret=PT197hFPSU" data-secret="PT197hFPSU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse said there hasn’t yet been talk between himself and other members of the Privileges and Elections Committee about tweaking the 2006 law to spell out the 90-day threshold of the NVRA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We haven&#8217;t had those conversations,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to resolving any confusion, Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin County, said that the state legislature broadly is always looking at ways past laws might need to be amended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This might be one of those times,” he said. “The question then becomes ‘is there a bipartisan solution?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might also come down to the question of how to prevent governors from overstepping or skirting federal law, as well as how to prevent presidential administrations from wading into state law, Aughenbaugh suspects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debacle playing out on the national stage might prompt Virginia legislators to ask, “Did the Youngkin administration too broadly interpret the law? Do we want to rein-in gubernatorial administrations in the future?” Aughenbaugh posited. “Meanwhile, how do you revise the law so that future presidential administrations don’t single out a state for lawsuits two weeks before Election Day?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse said there’s valid reasons for those types of deliberations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s more of a bigger picture with Governor Youngkin in terms of inciting fear and undermining our elections,” Rouse said of conversations he’s having with his fellow lawmakers. “We understand that this administration has been known to make mistakes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse pointed to how the administration pulled out of ERIC, a multi-state data-sharing coalition meant to maintain voter roll accuracy — and how he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-blocks-democratic-bills-dealing-with-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislation prompting Virginia’s return to it this year, along with other voting-related bills. The administration also mistakenly canceled over </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3,000 people’s registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, Rouse said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can same-day voter registration and provisional ballots fix it?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether eligible voters were caught up in the recent purge or run into other election-access issues, registrars have said that use of same-day registration and provisional ballots </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are an option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would allow them to vote on Election Day. Provisional ballots require follow-up after voting to verify a person’s address, citizenship status or other factors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an argument Republican national and state leadership is making as a reason Youngkin’s order and the subsequent voter purges should stand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if a person entitled to vote were erroneously removed from the voter rolls and unable to respond to the Commonwealth’s outreach, they may still take advantage of same-day registration and cast a ballot,” the state’s request to the Supreme Court stated.  “No legal voters could or would be disenfranchised.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aughenbaugh doubts the nation’s highest court will grant Virginia’s request so close to the elections and  suspects people who have been purged may not have to resort to provisional ballots this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think there are enough (Supreme Court) justices that have the appetite to wade into that dispute less than a week before elections,” he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“November 5 is going to be the biggest, most important day in the history of our country,” Trump said on his phone call to Youngkin and rally-goers. “We win Virginia, it&#8217;s over.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he and his opponent <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/26/strategists-analysts-see-excitement-and-pathways-for-kamala-harris-in-virginia/">Vice President Kamala Harris</a> have spent a lot of time campaigning in battleground states seen as key to winning the presidency like Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina, Trump said he thinks “Virginia is still in play.”</span></p>
<p>Democratic Party of Virginia chairwoman Susan Swecker disagreed, saying in a statement &#8220;Donald Trump knows he can&#8217;t win Virginia, so he is trying to exploit Glenn Youngkin&#8217;s illegal voter purge to satisfy his own sick obsessions.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump announced in his call that his campaign has a rally planned for </span><a href="https://event.donaldjtrump.com/events/president-donald-j-trump-to-hold-a-rally-in-salem-virginia?_gl=1*1h0mb8v*_gcl_au*MjA5NDc3OTMwLjE3Mjk2NDEyOTY.&amp;_ga=2.215556695.1387519888.1729889779-1039229875.1721857634" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nov. 2 in Salem, Virginia.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also stressed his goals to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and enhance funding for border security measures in his phoned-in comments, sentiments echoed by the day’s other speakers.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court,” he said and was met with cheers from the crowd. Youngkin and the state face two lawsuits over the voter roll removals, one from the Department of Justice, which have placed Virginia at the center of national dialogue about </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voter access and election security ahead of the Nov. 5 election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The lawsuits<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/"> allege</a> that the voter removals impacted eligible voters who may have made errors on their DMV paperwork that triggered the state Department of Elections to boot them from rolls, or people who became citizens after indicating otherwise on DMV forms. Republicans have framed the lawsuits as politically-motivated actions that hinder the state&#8217;s ability to block non-citizens from voting, which is already illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lara Trump reflected on the political violence that unfolded July 13 during her speech, as she recalled the assassination attempt on Trump’s life that day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not even a bullet was enough to stop this man, and that is why we are backing him all across this country,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stressed the importance of supporting candidates from the top to bottom of tickets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Make sure you remember that Donald Trump needs a (Republican-controlled) Congress to work alongside (of him),” Lara Trump said. “Vote the whole ticket down!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the governor and both Trumps’ comments were focal points of the rally, Wittman and Cao got some stage time as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his speech, Wittman noted the Republican priorities of working to address inflation as well as support for law enforcement. He, and nearly every speaker, quoted former Republican President Ronald Reagan —  “peace through strength” — regarding goals to tighten border security and support the U.S. Military. </span></p>

Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, speaks at an early vote rally in Chesterfield on Oct. 26, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods\Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wittman, who has typically won re-election by or over 20% margins since 2007, has seen occasional narrowing in recent years, winning his 2018 contest against Democrat Lavangelene Aereka Williams by 10.5%. This year’s democratic challenger, Leslie Mehta, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/21/leslie-mehta-hopes-to-flip-virginias-republican-leaning-1st-congressional-district/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hopes to flip the seat.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao said he is running “against the other Tim,” in reference to both Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz and Cao’s opponent, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine. Kaine ran for vice president in 2016 alongside presidential hopeful Hilary Clinton, who lost to Trump. Cao said that voters this year have a chance to make both Tims “failed vice presidential candidates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The  rally in Chesterfield was part of a series Youngkin’s political action committee Spirit of Virginia is hosting to boost GOP candidates statewide and encourage early voting. Despite Republican opposition to early voting in the past, Youngkin’s PAC has pressed for people to utilize it since last year’s General Assembly elections and, when </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump visited Chesapeake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this past summer, the governor stressed its use then, as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later in the day Youngkin was scheduled to appear in Farmville with U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, to support  state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland in his bid to represent the 5th Congressional District </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/witt-and-mcguire-square-off-in-sole-5th-district-debate/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">against</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democrat Gloria Witt. Jordan also visited Virginia Beach Friday night to support U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, who’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facing off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Justice</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sued </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the state and Youngkin administration for allegedly removing voters too close to the 90-day “quiet period” before Election Day. Voter rights and immigrant advocacy groups filed a similar suit, alleging that people affected by the purges are those whose Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork doesn’t indicate they are U.S. citizens because some of them may have become citizens in the time since renewing or receiving their license, while others may have made a blunder on their paperwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That case, brought forth by Virginia’s League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition For Immigrants Rights, was the basis of Friday’s ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles also ordered the state to work with local registrars to send letters to affected people within five days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let’s be clear about what just happened: only eleven days before a Presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals — who self-identified themselves as noncitizens — back onto the voter rolls,” Youngkin said in a statement Friday.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="F5YtZYadf1"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/">Voter purge lawsuits add to disenfranchisement allegations against Youngkin administration</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law directs the DMV to send monthly lists of people who failed to identify as citizens to the state Board of Elections, which are further forwarded to local registrars. It was carried by former Republican state Sen. Ken Cucinelli before it was signed by then-gov Tim Kaine, a Democrat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In defense of the process, Youngkin has stressed that a Democratic governor signed the law and he is simply employing it. </span></p>
<p>“Today&#8217;s injunction on Executive Order 35 is an essential step to have fair and just elections that will permit naturalized citizens to cast their vote in our federal elections without the unfair burden of being forced to re-register,” Jorge Figueredo at Edu-Futuro, an executive board member of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights, one of the groups suing the state, said in a statement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares alleged Giles was “urged” by the DOJ to reinstate the removed registrations and called the lawsuits a “shameful, politically motivated stunt.” </span></p>
<p>Reverberating beyond Virginia, the DOJ has also sued Alabama for the same issue. Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley weighed in with a statement doubling down on support for Youngkin and Miayares.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Youngkin and Miyares said that the state will petition the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and be prepared to take their case to the United States Supreme Court, if needed. </span></p>

(Lyle Solla-Yates)
</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s next building code update isn’t until 2027, but state lawmakers are already proactively thinking about ways it could be tweaked to help foster development on vacant or underutilized urban parcels and encourage affordable housing. An advisory group is expected to produce recommendations for how Virginia might update its zoning code to allow for certain multi-unit buildings over three stories to only need one stairwell instead of several. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea is that in lieu of an extra stairwell, buildings on smaller parcels in urban areas can still be developed or redeveloped to create additional housing units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you go from three to six floors, you open up a lot more options for units,” said Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, who carried a bill to create the advisory group in this year’s legislative session. “It’s not a cure-all, but it does allow you to redevelop and increase your units.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advisory group is weighing the pros and cons of doing so and preparing recommendations to share by the end of this year. His bill, also carried by Del. Adele McClure, D-Arlington, passed the legislature with bipartisan support before being signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re seeing an increased momentum across the country, both at the state level and the locality level, because of, to be quite frank, the housing crunch, the supply crunch, the affordability crunch,” VanValkenburg said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He points to localities that have allowed for single-staircases for buildings up to six floors — like Seattle, Washington, New York, New York and Honolulu, Hawaii. These types of structures require considering factors like caps on square footage or number of residential units per floor or specific additional fire safety measures.  At the state level, Tennessee passed </span><a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=SB2834&amp;GA=113" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a law </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this year to allow localities to adopt building code sections for single-stairwell residential buildings up to six stories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the concept could help with housing and infill development, public safety officials do note fire hazard concerns. Steven Sites, a fire marshal in Fairfax who serves on the advisory group, noted potential issues in single-stair buildings over three floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, he said that not all fire vehicles have the equipment to reach higher windows and he noted how both firefighters and residents would utilize the same stairwell when residents are trying to evacuate as firefighters respond to a fire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that if Virginia were to pursue allowing for single-stair buildings up to six floors, there could be things to “make this have a better look and feel for fire service.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could entail requiring smoke detectors in the common areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Currently in the code in an apartment-style building like this, there&#8217;s no requirement for smoke detection in these common areas,” he said. “So we know that&#8217;s a piece that could be added.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that another consideration could be if certain localities should be allowed to tap into single-stair code or if it would become a statewide requirement for buildings up to six floors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VanValkenburg said that he and McClure didn’t want to “legislate building codes.” He said that they saw their measure to create an advisory group as a way to encourage adoption of single-staircase allowances when Virginia updates its zoning code in 2027. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report from the advisory committee will be one part of the larger process when Virginia next updates its building code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Clark, vice president of government affairs for the Home Builders Association of Virginia, previously told The Mercury how tweaking staircase requirements can help solve development issues in spaces that are ripe for housing but would otherwise be abandoned projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has the potential to unlock some really challenging sites in cities and built out areas that are trying to figure out how to do infill right,” Clark said. “Removing one staircase can really change the equation on what housing can be provided more affordably. Once you start opening up square footage from the staircases and corridors that eat up so much space, you can create more of a communal feel for new buildings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the advisory group works on recommendations, it will still be some time before the state could consider adopting any of them. But VanValkenburg and McClure’s bill was part of a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">handful of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> housing-related bills to pass the legislature this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at addressing growing housing affordability issues in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s zoning, it’s the building code, it’s money in the affordable housing trust fund — it’s a bunch of different things,” VanValkenburg said of the various efforts it will take from various people and entities to help with Virginia’s affordable housing issues. “But this is a pretty low-hanging fruit policy idea, I think.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 1,600 voters have been removed from the rolls since an Aug. 7 executive order by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the governor said Wednesday on a press call. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy-five voter registrations were denied in the same time period, said Ryan Snow, counsel with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Virginia for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removing voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from rolls within 90 days of this year’s elections. Virginia’s League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition for Immigrants Rights had previously filed a similar suit. Earlier this week a federal judge ordered the Youngkin administration to </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-10-21/federal-judge-orders-release-of-names-impacted-by-voter-rolls-purge" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the names of affected voters as part of discovery in the League of Women Voters case and officials had to comply by Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snow confirmed to The Mercury that the numbers came from a list provided to the plaintiffs. The Mercury also has a pending Freedom of Information Act request seeking numbers of people flagged for removal and how many may have been reinstated or not removed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case will have a hearing in Alexandria Thursday morning where plaintiffs hope for an injunction of Youngkin’s order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the hearing, immigration advocates and other groups joined a press call Wednesday to lay out their case to the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ suit argues that voter removals may have disproportionately affected minority communities and could have wrongfully removed eligible voters without adequate notice or due process less than 90 days before the presidential election. Both cases allege this violates the federal National Voter Registration Act. That act imposes a 90-day quiet period on systematic voter roll purges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People in immigrant communities are hard workers — many of them working seven days a week,” said Beatriz Amberman, chair of the Virginia Coalition of Latino Organizations.  “There was not enough time assigned to inform the community and to have them get time off from work to go to the registrar&#8217;s office.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amberman said the administration could have partnered with Virginia’s Latino and Asian advisory boards “to help get the word out” for people to check their statuses as soon as possible in order for there to be time to cure any paperwork mistakes. She also said the administration could have utilized its communications staff to host press conferences with public service announcements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If voter records need to be reviewed or updated, the review should be done well in advance. This would ensure that voters have enough time to correct any issues on their voter registrations,” she said. “Our government has more resources to do this right than the average citizen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In defending his executive order, Youngkin has stressed to national media that it is based on precedent of a 2006 </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?061+sum+SB313" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  — carried by a Republican who went on to work for former president Donald Trump, and signed by democratic then-Gov. Tim Kaine — and that the process is “individualized.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It starts with a basic premise that when someone walks into one of our DMV&#8217;s and self-identifies as a noncitizen, and then they end up on the voter rolls, either purposely or by accident, that we go through a process individualized, not systematic, an individualized process based on that person’s self-identification as a noncitizen, to give them 14 days to affirm they are a citizen and if they don’t, they come off the voter rolls,” Youngkin told Fox News’ Shannon Bream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2006 law directs DMV to send monthly lists of people who failed to identify as citizens to the state Board of Elections to be further forwarded to local registrars. Youngkin’s Aug. 7 </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called for daily purges based on DMV data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares has filed opposition to the plaintiffs’ motion that </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.561386/gov.uscourts.vaed.561386.92.0.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin’s individualized argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filing focuses on the individual nature of self-reporting as a non-citizen, which suggests that factor evades the “systematic” qualifier in the National Voter Registration Act’s 90-day quiet period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snow argues that daily purges reduce the opportunity to catch mistakes before initiating a purge and could point to a systematic rather than individualized handling of the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know there are voters who registered decades ago and have updated their driver’s license many times, and if they check a box incorrectly, now they’re subject for removal,” Snow said. “We believe that under normal circumstances (with) information submitted from DMV data, there may be some system in place, at least, that would catch this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily removals “are a big part” of the case, he added because it “allows zero opportunity for anyone at any step in the process to verify that the basis for removal is accurate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY, will visit Virginia Beach Thursday evening to support Democratic candidate Missy Cotter Smasal in her challenge against U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/kiggans-and-smasal-face-off-in-highly-competitive-2nd-district/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s 2nd District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, before giving a boost to retired Lt. Col.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jefferies </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-congress-smasal-kiggans-hakeem-jeffries/article_955a0eac-d5bc-11ee-99ea-4f07936040ca.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Smasal earlier this year, bringing national attention to the district that often oscillates between partisan control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman and Anderson both emerged victorious from primary elections in their parties this summer. Their race has been considered a toss-up by multiple political forecasters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite trailing in polling last month, a new Wason Center </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/wasoncenter/surveys/archive/2024-10-23.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poll </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from Christopher Newport University shows Kiggans having a one-point lead over Smasal closer to Election Day, Nov. 5. Over 103,000 people have </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/early-voting/2024-november-general-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted early in that district so far</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the Virginia Public Access Project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman will have Jeffries’ support when he visits Virginia again this Sunday ahead of a canvass launch with Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner and U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince WIlliam. Spanberger currently represents the district and is vacating the seat to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/25/spanberger-and-earle-sears-tied-in-first-2025-gubernatorial-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">run for Virginia governor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though his 1st Congressional District race is not considered a toss-up by pundits and analysts, U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, will get a boost from Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump in Chesterfield County Saturday morning at Keystone Acres. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wittman, who has typically won re-election by or over 20% margins since 2007, has seen occasional narrowing in recent years, winning his 2018 contest against Democrat Lavangelene Aereka Williams by 10.5% . This year’s democratic challenger, Leslie Mehta, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/21/leslie-mehta-hopes-to-flip-virginias-republican-leaning-1st-congressional-district/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hopes to flip the seat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts believe she could at least reduce Wittman’s victory margins and signal how the Republican-leaning district is gaining Democratic grounds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump, who is the daughter-in-law of the Republican presidential candidate, former President Donald Trump, will also support U.S. Senate candidate Hung Cao.

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santia Nance and Gin Carter said they haven’t washed a single dish since their partners were released from prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As both loathe the household chore, Nance’s husband Quadaire Patterson and Carter’s husband Taj Mahon-Haft have been more than happy to take it on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Carter is in her fourth year of veterinarian school, Mahon-Haft said doing the dishes is just one more way to support her after she emotionally supported him through his incarceration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couples were part of a multi-group effort to change state law expanding pathways for early release of  incarcerated people who meet certain criteria. They also made friends along the way as people were released this past July through expansions to Earned Sentence Credits — a way that people with good behavior and who participate in educational advancements can trim some of their prison sentences. Despite initial opposition to its expansions in 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/earned-sentence-credit-expansions-new-parole-board-operations-to-take-effect-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed its implementation this year.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid navigating these new chapters in their lives, some have petitioned for a chance to vote in this year’s elections. Several of them say they have little hope they will be able to. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Constitutionally disenfranchised</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article2/section1/#:~:text=Virginia%20Law,-Constitution&amp;text=No%20person%20who%20has%20been,his%20competency%20has%20been%20reestablished." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Constitution,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people with felony convictions are all but permanently disenfranchised unless a governor pardons them or restores their rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, along with former democratic Govs. Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, had streamlined the process and eventually made people </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210408122644/https://www.restore.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically eligible for rights restoration if their sentence was complete</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then Youngkin </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/surovell-spruill-ask-if-youngkin-has-changed-rights-restoration-process/article_dd1232ba-c4fb-11ed-8b57-3723c72fb438.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quietly adjusted the process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, requiring individuals to submit petitions to regain their rights, resulting in lower </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">compared to previous administrations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exact criteria the governor considers when granting or rejecting applications remains unclear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s chapter of the NAACP took Youngkin’s administration to court last year to get answers but </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a judge ruled that most details are exempt from being shared </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">through a provision in the Freedom of Information Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what was shared in the administration’s FOIA response indicated that people who have completed probation and paid any due fines might be more likely to get a “yes” from him. An applicant disclosed in the FOIA who was classified “ineligible at this time” was still on probation and paying fines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then-spokeswoman for the governor, Macaulay Porter, told media at the time that the administration had acted “in good faith” in disclosing the information that it did provide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, applicants aren’t fully aware of what exact criteria they’d need to meet in order to be restored. In interviews with The Mercury, formerly incarcerated people shared their lingering </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">questions about whether their rights will be restored — including if their offense type matters as a disqualifier, if probation and fines are indeed a component, or if their potential good standing and public service to their community might be a factor in their favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some also wonder if the “individual basis” petition review system the administration has reiterated over the past year is actually happening.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Copy-and-paste rejections</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the partially-filled FOIA, a “reentry resource packet” people are given when they leave prison includes a paper informing them to apply for their rights to be restored. Though there’s no indication of the time it would take in that packet, other materials in the FOIA show it can take two to three months as various state agencies are involved in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About three months after applying for restoration, Newport News resident Justin Brown received an email with a rejection letter addressed “Dear applicant,” which didn’t describe why he was rejected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message was part of a mass email response the Youngkin administration sent to several hundred people who had applied for rights restoration; all of their email addresses were visible to everyone who’d gotten the message. The applicants began to chat in the email thread, revealing a series of concerns and questions about their access to the ballot box.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe each and every one of us has a right to know why we were denied,” said one of the respondents. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several speculated they were denied because of this year’s high profile federal elections. Some posited that the process isn’t handled on an individual basis, since they were all mass emailed with the same generic rejection letter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some respondents noted that like the governor, they are Republicans too.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One such would-be Republican voter called it an “insult to injury” to not be able to vote while, as a former felon, he also struggles to find work that would put the medic training he gained during his military service to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once I started talking with everyone else and seeing that this is a pattern of this administration, I wanted to raise some alarm bells,” Brown said in an interview with The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reached out to his state lawmaker, Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, who said she contacted the Secretary of the Commonwealth, Kelly Gee. Price told The Mercury that she had a conversation with Gee wherein the secretary apologized for the email error and stressed that while the alert to Brown and others had been done in mass, the restorations are handled on an individual basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said that he filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice (which is also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently suing Virginia over a purge of voter registrations too close to Election Day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). He hopes the DOJ could investigate the restoration process to ensure that it’s indeed being handled on a case-by-case basis, which the mass email put into question for him.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unclear criteria</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several other people with felony records told The Mercury they don’t recall getting mail or emails about their rejections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft, who has applied twice, discovered his latest rejection through checking an online portal. He doesn’t know why he was rejected, but he is still on probation. Patterson, who is also still on probation, hasn’t applied yet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our constitution has this antiquated language for a governor to determine your destiny,” Patterson said. “We’ve finished our sentences, but there’s this extra sentence that carries on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jared Rose, a Roanoke resident who works for a </span><a href="https://www.vacares.org/subcontractors--caas.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state-funded nonprofit organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.roanokeva.gov/2677/Gun-Violence-Prevention-Commission" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">serves on the city’s Gun Violence Prevention Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wonders if his probation status might result in a rejection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He hopes to become a peer recovery specialist to help people overcome substance abuse disorders and plans to start a nonprofit to pair formerly incarcerated people as mentors with at-risk youth. When he checked his restoration status on the portal, he said there was no information, despite applying earlier in the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I did a crime. I broke the law, you know, this is what I’ve got to deal with,” Rose said. “But somewhere along the line, there’s just so much red tape.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Looking forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft can’t vote for lawmakers yet, but he will frequent Virginia’s Capitol in the next legislative session to support their work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Carter had previously co-founded an organization called The Humanization Project, an advocacy group that also participates in educational programming. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_40495" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:200px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/tandg/" rel="attachment wp-att-40495"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-40495" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG-200x300.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/TandG.jpeg 562w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Taj Mahon-Haft (left) and Gin Carter (right) on their wedding day in August 2024. Image courtesy Mahon-Haft.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s easy to hate a conviction, but it’s not very easy to hate somebody when you know seven layers of them,” Mahon-Haft said. “You might have one thing you don&#8217;t agree with, but you can see them as a human being. When you see people as human beings, you have more humane policy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s grateful that Youngkin reversed his course on the Earned Sentence Credit law, for example. When announcing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-announces-efforts-to-support-formerly-incarcerated-people/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his own efforts to support formerly incarcerated people with re-entry </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this summer, Youngkin indicated that reversal was more about being in alignment with the state’s Supreme Court — which had ruled in favor of a man whose incarceration had been extended despite his earned credits that should have allowed him earlier release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Supreme Court this past year was very clear on the current sentence credits, and so we’re fully complying,” Youngkin said at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Mahon-Haft and Carter’s relationship helped spark an organization, Nance co-founded </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sistas In Prison Reform with other women whose loved ones were or are still incarcerated. And while she and Patterson are still planning a wedding to celebrate their union, they went ahead and eloped earlier this month. Mahon-Haft and Carter wed over the summer in Southwest Virginia, with some of their recently-released friends also part of the celebration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The couples plan to continue public engagement around the lived experiences of incarcerated people and their families, as well as advocate for laws that help people better reintegrate into society after time spent in prison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft also plans to keep applying for restoration until he gets a &#8220;yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if Democrats in Virginia’s state legislature get their wish, automatic restoration for completed sentences could be enshrined in the state’s constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To do so, a constitutional amendment will need to pass the state legislature two years in a row, with an election in the House of Delegates in between, before appearing on statewide ballots for everyone else to weigh in on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats plan to kickstart that process next year, with the potential for it to appear on statewide ballots by 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown, the Newport News resident, is already excited about the prospect and plans to visit Virginia’s Capitol to engage with lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then and beyond, Mahon-Haft will continue to wash his wife’s dishes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At some point years ago, when he was still locked up, I had a pile of dishes in my sink, and I joked ‘You never pull your weight in this relationship — why don&#8217;t you ever do the dishes?’” Carter recalled. She remembered that Mahon-Haft told her if she stuck by him through the end of his sentence, he’d do her dishes the rest of her life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He&#8217;s made good on that so far!” she said. </span></p>

(Courtesy of the Mehta and Wittman campaigns)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longtime incumbent U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, has served the 1st Congressional District since 2007. But this year’s Democratic challenger, Leslie Mehta, might make him work harder to win. She thinks she can flip the seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thing with Rob Wittman is that he’s never had a real challenge,” said Chaz Nuttycombe, founder of the State Navigate and CNalysis political forecasting organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Wittman has had challengers each time he’s run to hold onto his seat representing Virginia’s 1st Congressional District, he’s typically </span><a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/candidates/view/Robert-Joseph-Wittman" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won re-election with large margins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between himself and his usually-democratic challengers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a redrawing of the congressional maps in 2021 incorporated some Richmond-area suburbs into the district — which tend to lean Democrat — previous challenger Herb Jones lost by 13%. Wittman’s margins have typically ranged between 20 and nearly 50%. In 2018 — fresh off 2017&#8217;s &#8220;Blue Wave&#8221; in the state legislature — Democrat Lavangelene Aereka Williams lost by 10.5%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Whitman now faces Mehta, a lawyer and healthcare advocate, Nuttycombe suspects that margin could be further reduced to single-digits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can see Wittman having a single-digit reelection, which would be the first time that’s ever happened, because the district is getting bluer,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district, which is anchored by Virginia’s peninsula and some coastal areas, also wraps around Richmond in Chesterfield and Henrico counties before sprawling south towards Petersburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though CNalysis and the Virginia Public Access Project both rate it as leaning Republican, Mehta’s campaign might be making Wittman and Republicans work a little harder this year to keep him in Congress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta — who received the endorsement of Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, early on in the election cycle and over Jones, who’d run again but lost to Metha in their primary — believes she might be able to win. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger is one of the </span><a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most bipartisan members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Congress, and Mehta plans to legislate in that fashion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger, who is vying for the Democratic nomination for governor next year, backed Mehta after they had connected over a congressional effort to secure more medical research funding in an appropriations bill. The fight was personal for Mehta, whose oldest daughter suffered a rare genetic disorder before her death. Mehta has since gone on to be appointed by Republican Gov. Glenn Younkgin to serve on Virginia’s Rare Disease Council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta’s goal of bipartisanship and her passion for healthcare policy is why she believes she can appeal to voters. Healthcare affordability and access are issues she said she hears from canvassing and campaign events around the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In some of the rural parts of the district it can take 45 minutes to get to a maternal ward, or the fact that some doctors and other health care providers are just not providing or don’t have enough availability for Medicaid and Medicare patients because the reimbursements are so low,” she said. “People have to find other care providers, or it might take a long time to get into their preferred health care provider — that’s not really access.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta has been supportive of Democratic legislation to help with healthcare affordability and access like the Affordable Care Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, but she said there is still “more work to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In contrast, Wittman has supported repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, also dubbed &#8220;Obamacare.&#8221; Though he has </span><a href="https://wittman.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1188" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not always supported his party’s proposals that could do so</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022420" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he has voted against</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Inflation Reduction Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps another boon for her candidacy, Mehta suspects, is her promise to help codify abortion and other reproductive health protections into federal law. This contrasts with Wittman having voted to restrict federal funding for Planned Parenthood and having </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1011/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a Life At Conception Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Congress. Mehta pointed to how the legislation had no mention of exceptions for abortions in instances where someone was a victim of rape or incest, their life was threatened by the pregnancy, or severe fetal anomalies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that (abortion access) is not just a concern for Democrats,” she said. “But there are lots of Republicans in the district who are very concerned about his extreme stance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wittman’s campaign did not respond to interview requests. His congressional </span><a href="https://wittman.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=128025" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mentions him being “pro-life,” and having a “role to protect the lives of the unborn,” without alluding to  the word “abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a bipartisan fashion, some Republican-leaning states have protected access to the procedure in the years since federal protections were overturned. Democratic congressional candidates promise to restore federal protections, while many Republicans have backed off pushing for federal bans or limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On other healthcare matters, Wittman’s </span><a href="https://robwittman.com/issues/#healthcare" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> underscores his past experience working in the Virginia Department of Health before going into politics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a hallmark of the Inflation Reduction Act has involved ongoing efforts to reduce prescription drug costs — a goal of Wittman’s — he defended opposing that particular legislation overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot tax and spend our way out of inflation, which remains the top problem our nation is facing,” he wrote in a statement from 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite some </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/us-representative-1/district/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">metrics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showing support for Wittman’s re-election, other factors point to efforts to shore up his support, just in case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His fundraising from this year is double that of Mehta’s, and the Young Republican Federation of Virginia has included Wittman in a </span><a href="https://linktr.ee/yrfvdeployments2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">series of canvassing events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this month that include Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in the 7th District, and Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, the incumbent in the 2nd District </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers plan to introduce a “momnibus bill” in each chamber next year to help enhance maternal healthcare access, reduce mortality rates and address racial and unconscious bias. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A play on the term, “omnibus,” the forthcoming legislation will be able to address a series of factors that contribute to negative maternal health outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Too many mothers, especially Black mothers, are facing preventable risk in childbirth,” said Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth. “We must invest in comprehensive maternal care that ensures every woman, regardless of race or income, receives the quality health care she deserves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas and House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, had assembled the Black Maternal Health Summit to bring together a coalition of lawmakers from various states, healthcare professionals and maternal healthcare advocates. After an initial gathering in the morning, people split off into breakout groups for roundtable discussions through the afternoon. Lawmakers from other states like Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas were present, who will also press for related policy in their home states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“​​We’re facing this issue in 2024 because of a lack of implementing policy,” said Georgia state Senator Tonya Anderson. “The system was designed for failure, for a ‘superior’ and an ‘inferior’ class — we’re changing it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Virginia’s omnibus packages will be an effort to require </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-black-maternal-health-carroll-foy-youngkin/article_4608fd84-d1ae-11ee-8379-138efdfc34c7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unconscious bias training</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for nursing license renewals. The bipartisan bills cleared the state legislature earlier this year before </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers say that more targeted training will be an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to preventable deaths or complications from childbirth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that Black women are </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to die </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from pregnancy complications than white women. Studies have also shown that women of color are more likely to have negative health outcomes, in part, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from racial bias by healthcare providers.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being Black is not a risk factor — racism is,” Noelene Kimiko Jeffers, a certified nurse-midwife and professor at John Hopkins School of Nursing, said during a discussion panel earlier in the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than the unconscious bias training, advocates and lawmakers view the omnibus package as another chance to revive other maternal health bills that either failed to advance last year or were vetoed by the governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, House Majority Leader Charniele Herring’s bill to reestablish a maternal mortality data task force was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/27/youngkin-to-reestablish-maternal-health-data-task-force-after-vetoing-bill-that-would-have-done-so/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed by Youngkin </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in May before he announced the formation of his own version of a force a month later.  Other maternal and fetal health-related bills were continued to next year and could become part of the omnibus package. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Youngkin has supported expanding </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health hubs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of targeted economic and public health initiatives in the Petersburg area, and this year he </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to require health insurance coverage for doulas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a panel at the start of the day, Birth in Color founder Kenda Sutton-El stressed how state legislatures can support community-based organizations. This is because existing organizations like hers — which provides doula care for clients and has a policy advocacy wing that engages the state legislature — already have built-in trust with different communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certified nurse-midwife Nichole Wardlaw also noted how lawmakers can support this type of healthcare worker with access to hospitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Help us get credentialed,” she said, as not every midwife has ease of access to clinics and hospitals around the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wardlaw explained how some patients that may have wanted a home birth find that they need to go to a hospital for an epidural to manage pain, but “I can’t always go with them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">closures of obstetrics units</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at hospitals in rural areas of the state, midwives and doulas have played a role in bolstering maternal healthcare and patient advocacy. Certified nurse-midwives — who specialize in pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum care — have helped fill gaps in areas where there are shortages of other healthcare professionals with these specialties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A survey commissioned by Virginai’s Department of Medical Services revealed this past summer that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/state-survey-shows-barriers-to-prenatal-care-access-for-medicaid-patients/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long enrollment periods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for new Medicaid patients pushes them further into their pregnancies before they can get routine care and a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/virginias-rural-healthcare-committee-considers-unique-challenges-possible-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rural health committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been convening around the state to compile a list of legislative recommendations — to include maternal healthcare issues — ahead of next year’s General Assembly session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On what’s to come from Friday’s summit, Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, said some of the bills lawmakers want to reintroduce will come back as standalones or in the omnibus package, and that more policy will stem from coordination and brainstorming across states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are working across the South with different legislators to look at bills to go even further than we have,” she said.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><strong><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em></strong> <em>On Wednesday, Oct. 30, the United States Supreme Court granted a stay blocking a lower court&#8217;s order for Virginia to pause its voter removal program, allowing additional purges through Election Day. Find more details on the decision <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/">here</a>, and read below to find out how you can still vote if you were wrongly removed from Virginia voter rolls.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though state law allows people who didn’t indicate citizenship status when filling out forms at the Department of Motor Vehicles to be removed from voter rolls, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two lawsuits have alleged that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration is violating federal law </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by continuing removals within 90 days of Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone who became a citizen since their last DMV visit, or who suspects they made an error filing out their paperwork that would have booted them from voter lists, there are still ways to cast a ballot in next month’s elections. </span></p>
<p>Registrars and election workers won&#8217;t turn eligible voters away from polls if they wish to utilize same-day registration or a provisional ballot, according to Henrico County Registrar Mark Coakley.</p>
<p>“So if they were canceled or not registered, provisional ballots are a fail-safe method.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provisional ballots, most often used in same-day voter registration, are also used when people run into paperwork or registration issues that might need to be resolved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a provisional ballot, voters will still need to follow up with their local registrar office to provide additional documents that can help verify their identity or other facts, like if they are residents of Virginia and the city or county they voted in, and whether they are U.S. citizens or have had their voting rights restored after a previous felony conviction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can research to make sure they are citizens or became citizens or had their rights restored,” Coakley explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coakley said that when using a provisional ballot, voters are also given instructions to help with the follow-up procedures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They&#8217;ll get a letter attached to their provisional ballot, giving them all the information of ‘This is the reason why (you may have this ballot)’ and ‘Here&#8217;s the ways to get hold of us to present evidence if you choose to do so,’” he said.  </span></p>
<p>Chesterfield County Registrar Missy Vera stressed that same-day registration can happen at any early voting location as well as on Election Day, which is Nov. 5.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coakley also suggested that anyone who might be concerned they could have been mistakenly caught up in the recent voter roll purges check Virginia Department of Elections’ </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online citizen portal </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to see their voter status. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Gaines, a communications manager at the Department of Elections, also said that people “can always reach out to their local registrar if they have questions about their registration status.”</span></p>
<p>Vera, from Chesterfield County, concurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone may call our office to inquire about their registration or inquire as to their options,&#8221; Vera said. &#8220;We are happy to help.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/voter-guide/2024-virginia-voter-guide/"><b><i>Early voting — by mail, ballot drop boxes, and at select locations — runs through Nov. 2.  Election Day is on Nov. 5.</i></b></a></p>

Enrollment in the program has more than doubled since Medicaid expansion, leading to rising demand for mental health services. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 35,000 Virginians are still waiting to find out if they remain eligible for Medicaid, as Virginia’s Department of Medical Services projects it will use its $95 million reserve fund to cover delayed payments for fiscal year 2025, according to a presentation agency leaders made to the state Senate Finance Committee Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This also means that until it’s sorted out, the state is paying capitation fees, fixed amounts of money to healthcare providers, in order to cover healthcare for those patients. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid is a state and federal program that provides insurance coverage to low-income people or people with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pending redeterminations are part of ongoing national efforts to sort out who should stay on Medicaid and who is no longer eligible. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding,” as provisions of federal law have expired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A top reason for unenrolling people from Medicaid is that they no longer meet the financial requirements to be eligible — such as income at or below 80% of federal poverty levels. While the ineligibility data could signal higher incomes, which can be a good thing for people, policy analysts at The Commonwealth Institute cautioned over the summer that this is not always the case when it comes to health insurance coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, someone could hold a combination of part time jobs that contribute to their overall income — which wouldn’t entail employer-sponsored insurance.  Others might have a temporary spike in income through seasonal work that kicks them off eligibility for Medicaid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, more than 2 million Virginians have been redetermined, according to DMAS director Cheryl Roberts, and over the next year the remaining 35,000 people will be sorted out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is not always swift, said DMAS chief financial officer Chris Gordon.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Tuesday</span><a href="https://sfac.virginia.gov/pdf/committee_meeting_presentations/2024%20Interim/October/No5_DMAS_MedicaidYE_101524.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he told members of the Virginia Senate Finance Committee that “some of those folks are easier to be redetermined and decide if they qualify to remain on Medicaid” but that other demographics take more time, such as people in nursing facilities or who are in home-care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those people take longer because it&#8217;s a paper application,” he said. “It&#8217;s 14 pages, and we have to determine if their assets and resources allow them to continue to be members in our Medicaid population.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the Centers For Medicaid and Medicare Services have indicated the unwinding process should be completed by the end of next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though total enrollment trended higher than DMAS had forecast for much of the year, it is now lower, totaling 1.97 million people as of Oct. 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DMAS receives quarterly pharmacy rebates from drug manufacturers to offset the overall cost of prescription drugs in the Medicaid program. DMAS then returns those rebates to federal and state-share accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Gordon said, after the previous fiscal year closed and DMAS received details from Virginia’s pharmacy benefit manager, “we learned that $41 million out of the $60 million we applied in the state actually should have been applied — instead of being dropped into the state general fund — should have been applied to the coverage assessment fund.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that meant DMAS didn’t have enough money at the end of the fiscal year to resolve it in that year, which ended June 30.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We only ended with $22 million in state general funds, at the lowest this agency has ever had in state general funds ever in the history of this agency,” Gordon said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that DMAS needs to correct overpayment to the general fund and underpayment to coverage assessment and federal accounts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department may also have some funding aid from $88.5 million earmarked specifically as a “Medicaid Contingency,” </span><a href="https://www.finance.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/secretary-of-finance/pdf/Aug-JMC-w-appendix-08.14.FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to both the Senate and House finance committees this past August. The overall presentation reviewed 2024’s fiscal year revenues and the financial condition of the state. Gov. Glenn Youngkin has until mid-December to present any amendments to the 2024-2026 budget to both committees. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before becoming a lawyer, state lawmaker and Virginia’s first Black House Speaker, Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, was, for years, unable to vote. After a previous felony conviction, it wasn’t until former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell restored his rights that Scott could participate in democracy again — eventually paving the way for his own run for office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department on Friday filed a lawsuit against Virginia, alleging that a state program aimed at removing people from the voter rolls, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin touted in an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August, was implemented too close to the Nov. 5 elections and wrongfully included eligible voters. Scott said it’s another example of Youngkin’s administration restricting voting access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would not be where I am today if I had to depend on somebody like Glenn Youngkin to help me get my rights restored,” Scott said in an interview Monday. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37471" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4042/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-37471" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth (left), with former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, who restored his voting rights after a felony conviction, at the state Capitol in January. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a memo in response to the suit obtained by The Mercury over the weekend, Richard Cullen, a counselor to Youngkin, wrote that Virginia’s process for removing noncitizens from the voting rolls has taken place under both Democratic and Republican governors. It also outlines how Youngkin believes he is not violating a federal policy to have purged rolls by a set time that would allow a buffer to resolve any errors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Federal law does not prohibit the removal of noncitizens from the voting rolls,” the memo said, adding that the 90-day “quiet period” under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) is “not relevant to this process since Virginia conducts an individualized — not systematic — review per Virginia law in order to correct registration records.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin on Friday called the lawsuit “unprecedented,” underscoring that his executive order simply was “appropriately enforcing a 2006 law” signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, which requires Virginia to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these common sense steps that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Scott commended the Justice Department for taking action (it also recently filed a similar </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/09/27/justice-department-alabama-lawsuit-voting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit against Alabama)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason that we have this 90-day rule is that we don’t want citizens to be accidentally removed,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Related lawsuit stresses potential effect on naturalized citizens</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ suit also isn’t the only litigation that Youngkin faces over his Executive Order 35. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters of Virginia earlier this month alleges that the process used to purge the rolls violates the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, disenfranchising eligible voters while raising concerns over transparency and accuracy in the state’s voter registration system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal action by the two nonprofits came after reports surfaced that Virginians were being removed from the voter rolls due to alleged inaccuracies and outdated information. Many of these removals, the suit argues, were done without proper notification or investigation, leaving eligible voters unaware that they could no longer cast their ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit also claims that the purges disproportionately affect minority communities, low-income voters, and those who may not have easy access to the internet to check their voter status. It further asserts that the Youngkin administration has failed to adequately confirm whether a voter is ineligible, potentially silencing their voice in the democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Naturalized citizens serve in our armed forces, pay taxes, and show their patriotism daily with their acts and contributions to our society,” Monica Sarmiento, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights, said in a statement earlier this month.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Forcing new American communities to carry undue burden that no other community is required to comply with is discrimination, and does not represent the values that our commonwealth stands for,” Sarmiento said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Youngkin’s executive order, the Virginia Department of Elections is now required to send just one notice to individuals at risk of being removed from the voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This notice is based on information from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), but there is no requirement for the accuracy of that information to be verified by either the Department of Elections or local election officials before action is taken. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin County, said Monday that the law referenced in Youngkin’s executive order relates to persons who self-identify as “non-citizens” on DMV forms that are turned over to the State Board of Elections, which then checks the information against the voter rolls and notifies those persons of pending removal from the state’s voter registration list, giving them 14 days notice of removal and the right to challenge.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And there are failsafe measures to this,” Stanley said. “Even if they are subsequently removed from the rolls, let’s say, in error, those persons can still register to vote on Election Day under our ‘same day’ registration law. So I fail to see why the federal government is doing this but for no other reason but to try to upset our otherwise sound voter registration process here in Virginia for political purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview Monday afternoon that Youngkin’s executive order “brought together a lot of operating practices and standards that may have been scattered over a number of other places, put it together in one document and demonstrated to the commonwealth that the governor took this seriously and was exercising his responsibilities as the chief executive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the responsibilities of the executive branch, working with the legislative branch, is to “ensure confidence in our electoral processes and systems, and that was the whole intent of this, I think,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Elections Commissioner Susan Beals, whom Youngkin appointed as Virginia’s top elections official just weeks after assuming office in early 2021, said </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one week before the governor issued his executive order that a process to prohibit non-citizens from voting was already in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anybody who comes to the DMV and shows documents that indicate they are a non-citizen — whether it is a visa or residency — their name is sent to the Department of Elections on a monthly basis so we can double check to make sure that they did not make their way on our voter rolls. If we find them on the rolls, we cancel them,” Beals said in the interview. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Previous election access issues</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two lawsuits are the latest in a string of voting access issues during Youngkin’s tenure.</span></p>

In October 2023, more than 3,000 people had been mistakenly </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/01/voting-rights-advocates-blast-youngkin-admin-over-error-affecting-3400/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removed from voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Earlier that year, the administration also quietly adjusted its </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/surovell-spruill-ask-if-youngkin-has-changed-rights-restoration-process/article_dd1232ba-c4fb-11ed-8b57-3723c72fb438.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration of voting rights process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Constitution permanently disenfranchises people with felony convictions unless a governor pardons them or restores their rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McDonnell, the Republican governor who restored Scott’s rights, along with democratic Govs. Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam, had streamlined the process and eventually made it automatic. Now a petition-based process, Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers have dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compared to his predecessors’ and little criteria has been made available to explain conditions for a restoration petition to be granted.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia chapter of the NAACP took Youngkin to court last year to get answers but a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">judge ruled that most details are exempt from being shared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through a provision in the Freedom of Information Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Youngkin’s changes to the process aren’t going against the law, Democratic lawmakers feel it’s being used as a way to limit who can vote. The latest executive order falls amid </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/nx-s1-5147789/voting-election-2024-noncitizen-fact-check-trump" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continued allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that illegal immigrants are trying to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/trump-youngkin-urge-early-voting-during-tele-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telephone rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Trump, Youngkin touted the purge of over 6,000 people as noncitizens. But a Washington Post review of records and interviews with election officials </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that most of the purge stemmed from paperwork errors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like people forgetting to check a citizenship box. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also noted that of Virginia’s three illegal voting prosecutions to occur since 2022, none involved a question of citizenship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, much of the data Forbes used in its analysis was from 2020 or 2021, and in recent years Virginia’s legislature has passed several laws bolstering access to care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is in the second year of a three-year plan called </span><a href="https://www.hhr.virginia.gov/12-14-2022-Two-Page-BH-Plan-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Help, Right Now </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">— which entails budget proposals and goals from Gov. Glenn Youngkin and legislative actions by state lawmakers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, when the national mental health emergency hotline transitioned to the easier-to-remember 988 system, Virginia </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0248" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funded expanded call centers and listed deployment of mobile crisis units and community care teams as part of their responsibilities. Use of 988 has </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/09/25/virginia-988-hotline-mental-health-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia. </span></p>
<p>This week, Youngkin announced several million in grants to community service boards around the state that will be used to help with crisis response.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin is committed to building on ongoing efforts to develop innovative solutions that address the challenges within our behavioral health care system and ensure that Virginians in crisis receive the appropriate care and support they need,” said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some building on those efforts occurred this past legislative session when the governor signed </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb601" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bipartisan bills</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to require insurance coverage for mental health services provided through mobile crisis units, crisis receiving centers and crisis stabilization units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the hallmarks of the 2024 session was </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title37.2/chapter8/section37.2-808/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvo’s Law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows families members or guardians to be present to provide support and decision-making when someone in a mental health crisis is being considered for temporary detention orders. The legislation stemmed from the 2023 death of Irvo Otineo, who was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/scathing-report-calls-for-a-ban-of-prone-restraint-tactics/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed while restrained by sheriff&#8217;s deputies and workers in a state-run psychiatric hospital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His mother, Carolina Ouko, had been denied the ability to see him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our families are part of our mental health and we need them beside us in those tough times,” Ouko </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/virginia-governor-signs-mental-health-bills-irvo-otien-june-15-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as Youngkin signed the law named for her son. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous law to stem from mental health related tragedies is the </span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/human-resource-development-and-management/health-equity/mdpa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcus Alert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, named for Marcus-David Peters, who was killed by police in 2018. The alert, which has so far only been implemented by a handful of localities in Virginia, creates coordination between 911 and regional call centers to triage best response from law enforcement and trained clinicians when handling mental health situations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://bhc.virginia.gov/documents/BHC%20Staff%20-%20ABLEO.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent Behavioral Health Commission presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted that arrests of people in mental health crises have a “devastating impact” on people in crisis and “stress local and state resources.” Despite Virginia having a prevalence of crisis intervention-trained law enforcement officers, the report stated that crisis response should include or be led by clinicians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instances where someone assaults an officer who responds to their crisis are more common the longer people are held waiting in hospital emergency rooms under temporary detention orders, BHC policy analyst Claire Pickard Mairead told lawmakers at the meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mairead’s presentation noted how law enforcement leaders and research literature found that CIT has improved officers’ confidence in handling mental health crises, but there is little evidence of such officers being able to reduce arrests of people in crisis or injuries that might arise to the affected individuals or the officer if interactions turn forceful. The study did find that officers in Virginia expressed interest in CIT “refreshers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation from 2020 directed the Department of Criminal Justice Services to develop a CIT training program that includes recertification and advanced training. Those new standards await approval from Youngkin’s office. From there, they can be open to public comment and go through final regulatory stages, the report read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a desire for co-responder models, the report stated, as “effective ways to include clinicians when safety risks exist.” However, lack of funding and mental health workforce shortages have limited implementation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while lawmakers continue to explore how to improve mental health crisis response and law enforcement’s role in those, Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, said “our focus needs to be on keeping people out of crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After losing his son, Gus, to a mental health crisis a decade ago, Deeds has been </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/18/virginia-creigh-deeds-mental-health/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a leader in reforming mental health access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state and chairs the Behavioral Health Commission, which conducts studies and explores legislative proposals each year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On future goals, Deeds said that continued support for community service boards — a public health resource — can help, but that the state should explore how private sectors can become more robust too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also have to be looking at the private sector providers to find out what kind of barriers we have to building the workforce, and what kind of barriers are out there that prevent effective mental health care in every part of the commonwealth,” Deeds added</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help address some of the workforce shortages, Sen. Tara Durant, R-Stafford, carried a </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB403" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will help create pathways for people with community college degrees to enter mental health professions as technicians and technician assistants. Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, introduced </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1499" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can make it easier for people with master’s degrees in psychology to practice independently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harrison Hayes, the director of the Virginia Health Workforce Development Authority, also pointed to a </span><a href="https://www.vhcf.org/boost200/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funded by the state government and the Virginia Health Care Foundation that’s aimed at helping accelerate the licensure of social workers and counselors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Virginia’s various efforts to better fund mental health resources in recent years, Deeds said there’s still more work to do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality is, we’ve chronically underfunded mental health over such a long period of time,” he said. “It’s going to take a lot of years to get this right.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares joined attorneys general from 19 states in a lawsuit over a rule change that expands staffing requirements for nursing homes, which the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services  announced earlier this year.  Nursing homes are currently required by Congress to provide eight hours of continuous registered nurse staffing per day.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nursing homes are currently required by Congress to provide eight hours of continuous registered nurse staffing per day. The new CMS rule would increase that requirement to 24 hours per day in phases — starting May 2026 for urban facilities and May 2027 for rural facilities. The rule also stipulates that nursing homes meet additional reporting requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares and others in the suit allege the CMS rule will be difficult and costly for long-term care facilities to meet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This new rule is yet another example of Washington bureaucrats imposing sweeping mandates without considering the devastating impact on our communities,” Miyares said in a statement. “Nursing homes in Virginia and across the country already face challenges, and this policy will force them out of business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/30/virginia-nursing-homes-say-theyre-limiting-admissions-due-to-a-lack-of-staff/#:~:text=By%3A%20Graham%20Moomaw%20%2D%20October%2030%2C%202023%203%3A10%20pm&amp;text=A%20recent%20survey%20of%20Virginia,to%20accommodate%20everyone%20seeking%20care."><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from last October found that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly half nursing home or long-term care facilities have limited new admissions because they don’t have enough workers to accommodate everyone seeking care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rural healthcare committee composed of Virginia delegates has been touring the state since April, where healthcare </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/18/virginias-rural-healthcare-committee-considers-unique-challenges-possible-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workforce shortages were noted in meetings </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from Southwest Virginia to the Eastern Shore. The cohort will deliver a report with legislative and state budget recommendations by the end of this year. Addressing workforce shortages may be part of that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the federal rule outlines a “hardship exemption” for some nursing facilities that may be unable to meet the new requirements. Qualifying facilities would post notice of their status on site and the exemption information would also be available on </span><a href="https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/results?searchType=NursingHome&amp;page=1&amp;city=Richmond&amp;state=VA&amp;zipcode=&amp;radius=25&amp;sort=closest&amp;tealiumEventAction=Result%20Page%20-%20Search&amp;tealiumSearchLocation=search%20bar&amp;tealiumSearchInputType=manual%20search%20term" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for transparency. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods /Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Affordable Care Act saved my life,” said Laura Packard, a Virginia resident, Stage 4 Hodgkin’s Lymphoma survivor and health advocate who joined other advocates and state and federal Democratic lawmakers on Monday as part of a national bus tour highlighting Democrat-led efforts to expand health care access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed “Care Force One,” the bus is making stops around Virginia and 16 other states over the next few weeks featuring speakers from Congress and state legislatures, alongside people sharing stories of how they benefited from the Affordable Care Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hallmark of Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration, the ACA established a public insurance marketplace and prevented insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. Currently, over 20 million people utilize it nationwide and nearly 400,000 Virginians could pay more for health insurance if it were repealed. Amid this year’s congressional and presidential election where Trump hopes to win a second term in the White House, Democrats caution he will again seek to undo the ACA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the time of Packard’s 2017 diagnosis, Republicans in the U.S. Congress and then-President Donald Trump were </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-gop-leaders-take-victory-lap-after-house-passes-trumpcare-n754896" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrating steps towards repealing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the now 14-year-old federal policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s campaign hasn’t formally rolled out plans for healthcare policy if re-elected. But speakers at Monday’s event pointed to his past actions — like his </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-to-propose-big-cuts-to-safety-net-in-new-budget-this-week/2017/05/21/62c01f44-3e34-11e7-adba-394ee67a7582_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget proposals to cut Medicaid funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> —  along with statements his running made made in recent media interviews and statements Trump made during his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris as clues to his intentions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his debate with Harris in early September, Trump said that there are “concepts and options” for a cheaper system than the ACA that he will outline in the “not-too-distant future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent interviews vice presidential candidate Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance indicated the administration would </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/vance-says-future-trump-administration-defund-planned-parenthood-rcna174211" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">end federal funding to organizations like Planned Parenthood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and suggested a plan to </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/09/18/vance-targets-inflation-immigration-at-raleigh-event/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate patients into different health insurance pools based on individual risks.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are not going to let their ‘concepts of a plan’ happen where insurance companies get to pick and choose who they want to cover,” Packard said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Democratic 1st Congressional District candidate Leslie Mehta, Medicaid helped her family cover additional expenses for her disabled daughter Brooke. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before her death, Brooke lived with a rare neurological disorder called Rhett’s Syndrome that severely limits motor skills and language. Mehta said Monday that initially, she was denied Medicaid coverage for her daughter’s condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once covered, the family was able to get a device that helped them communicate with her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Medicaid allowed me to be able to hear the words ‘I love you’ from my oldest daughter,” Mehta said. “When we talk about Medicaid, and we talk about the ability to have it for so many in our country, this is what it means.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement last week, Trump’s campaign said that more concrete outlines are forthcoming with a goal of reducing health care costs by other methods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He will release more details, but his overall position on healthcare remains the same: bring down costs and increase the quality of care by improving competition in the marketplace,” national campaign secretary Karolina Leavitt said in a statement sent to The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, noted how Democrats in Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 — which included price caps on insulin and the ability to negotiate the prices of other popular prescription medications. At the state level and prior to being elected to congress, McClellan helped pass a bill to create Virginia’s state healthcare exchange. And in 2018, a few Virginian Republicans backed Democrat-led efforts to expand Medicaid eligibility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speakers, including McClellan, also pointed to the “Project 2025” policy guidebook from conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation as a reason for caution. Trump has distanced himself from the blueprint, which outlines cuts to Medicaid, despite his ties to several of its authors and the organization having </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised him for tapping into previous their proposals in his first term</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Project 2025 are coming for our healthcare,” McClellan said. “We have a lot of work to do to build on the progress we have already made.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> <em>The Virginia Mercury is not using the last names of the women in this article to protect their privacy and safety. The accounts of all three women have been verified with medical records and by a medical professional with knowledge of their experiences.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nisa knew her third pregnancy was a non-starter. She didn’t know that she would fear death for 18 days while trying to get an abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I felt like I had a ticking time bomb inside of me,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because Nisa has Von Willebrand Disease, a genetic blood disorder that prevents clotting. It puts her at higher risk for bleeding to death during things like injuries, surgeries, or if she were to have a miscarriage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her first two pregnancies had been challenging and once she had been diagnosed with the blood disorder, she’d decided not to have more children for fear of complications or passing the disease onto others. By the time she became unexpectedly pregnant last summer, she was also in the throes of Stage 4 endometriosis symptoms — a diagnosis that would later lead to her having a hysterectomy. She&#8217;d also had an endometrial ablation to treat endometriosis symptoms before finding out she was pregnant last summer — placing her in a more at-risk pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under 10 weeks of gestation at the time, Nisa said she otherwise would have been able to take abortion medication. With her disease, she couldn’t. Surgical abortions also posed challenges because she needed to have specific medications and extra blood on standby. The procedure was denied by her local providers in coastal Virginia, she said, and the local Planned Parenthood facilities didn’t have the resources. A hospital was her best bet for completing the procedure, but it took 18 days to sort out an abortion at VCU Health in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Virginia’s status as the least-restrictive Southern state for abortion access, Nisa wonders how many others may be falling through health care gaps as she did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is not safe. We think we’re safe, but we’re not,” she said. “How do you treat a person who isn’t the standard in this post-Roe world?”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s barriers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two and a half years ago, states around the country have shored up their protections or enacted various bans and restrictions. And though Virginia is the least restrictive Southern state — and a bastion for out-of-state patients — a </span><a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA3324-2.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_richmond&amp;stream=top" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indicates some hurdles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, abortion is </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title18.2/chapter4/article9/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal for any reason until around 26 weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with limited exceptions for later abortions. In those cases, three physicians must attest that someone’s physical or mental health would be “irremediably impaired” if a pregnancy were to continue. Conversely, surrounding states have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/florida-abortion-ban-six-weeks-virginia-susan-swecker/article_e5c13ac8-0708-11ef-9bfa-831eade60f7b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">near-total bans or limits as low as 6 weeks on the procedure.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key findings from the RAND Corporation report noted how abortion law is currently housed in Virginia’s criminal code (a Class 4 felony for unlawfully conducted abortions), the three-physician threshold for some abortions, and lack of clarity on the “ability to provide second-trimester abortions in non-hospital settings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. William Fitzhugh, who runs clinics in Richmond, Newport News and Roanoke, said he’s seen a flux of out-of-state patients over the past two years. But sometimes, he’s had to refer patients elsewhere. For example, by the time a Tennessee patient had made it to one of his clinics, she was 28 weeks along, he said, so he referred her to Maryland where there are no gestation limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I worry for other women in gray areas like mine,” Nisa said. “I had family that could help watch my kids and I didn’t have to travel far, but I still had to travel in my own state. There are women who can’t take time off work or have childcare.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina resident Kishia ended up having to take time off work and her children had to miss school for a few days so they could travel to Fitzhugh&#8217;s Richmond clinic for her 14-year-old daughter to get an abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She called the experience “H-E-double-L.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More important, Kishia said, is the fact that her daughter Myasia has been in pain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 19-weeks of gestation, she couldn’t legally obtain an abortion in North Carolina and being further into gestation means a more invasive abortion procedure. In these cases, small rods are typically placed in the cervix to prepare it for an abortion to occur the next day. Kishia said the family would have sought an abortion sooner if they could have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myasia has had regular menstrual cycles, her mother said, and with </span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/22044-bleeding-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bleeding in early gestation common in 15% to 25% of pregnancies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Myasia hadn’t realized right away that she was pregnant. By the time she did and told her mother, when they visited a clinic in Charlotte they were told she was too far along for the state&#8217;s 12-week limit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People get abortions for different reasons,” Kishia stressed as she noted that people can have medical issues, or be young and not emotionally or financially ready to care for an unplanned child. In Myasia’s case, she is still technically a child herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a smile, Kishia said that she is grateful her family was able to connect with an abortion fund to offset travel costs. She said she doesn’t plan on having to go through their ordeal again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kishia said she’s somewhat tuned in to state, congressional, presidential and gubernatorial elections. As her chance to vote in North Carolina this fall approaches, she’ll be thinking about abortion access and other reproductive rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think this should ever be banned,” she said. </span></p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion laws had been a flashpoint in Virginia’s state legislative elections last year as Democrats promised to place protections in the state’s constitution and many Republicans proposed capping most abortions at 15 weeks of gestation. Their idea, approved by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, noted exceptions for rape, incest and life-threatening situations for the pregnant person but </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lacked provisions for severe fetal anomalies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (which are often detected at or after 15 weeks). Ultimately, Democrats retained control of the Senate and gained control of the House of Delegates.</span></div>
	</div>
	
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Legal challenges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another finding in the RAND report noted local-level abortion hurdles when it comes to city, town and county governments in the state. Such is the case in  parts of Southwest Virginia, where local governments have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/florida-abortion-ban-six-weeks-virginia-susan-swecker/article_e5c13ac8-0708-11ef-9bfa-831eade60f7b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to deter the establishment of abortion clinics. A clinic in Bristol has been embroiled in </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/04/03/owner-says-abortion-clinic-in-bristol-is-here-to-stay-regardless-of-the-outcome-of-a-lawsuit-seeking-to-terminate-her-lease/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with its building’s landlords that threaten its existence. Conversely, Alexandria passed an </span><a href="https://www.alxnow.com/2023/04/13/zoning-change-that-makes-abortion-clinics-easier-to-open-in-alexandria-draws-ire-of-local-catholic-leadership/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_richmond&amp;stream=top" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinance to make it easier for clinics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to open and Richmond recently </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-07-23/planned-parenthood-richmond-clinic-city-council-land-transfer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transferred land for cheap to Planned Parenthood to set up another clinic in town.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state level, democratic  lawmakers still plan to strengthen Virginia’s abortion access laws. In 2025, they plan to introduce a proposed constitutional amendment. It will need to pass two years in a row with a House of Delegates election in between before appearing on statewide ballots for voters to approve or reject. Placing protections in the constitution would make them less susceptible to partisan shifts in the legislature over time. Even Republican-leaning states have approved similar ballot measures in recent years, showing that it is not a totally partisan issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wouldn’t be the first time Virignia has tried to enshrine abortion access in its constitution. </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/house-panel-votes-down-abortion-rights-amendment-extradition-bill/article_aad3cc5a-af07-11ed-8954-a369717bdbc1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar proposals have failed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the two previous legislative sessions. A sticking point had been language that GOP lawmakers alleged was too broad and would go further than Roe’s legal framework.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The language, much like language in other states’ passed </span><a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/Documents/2022/Docs/BILLS/PR0005/PR0005%20As%20adopted%20by%20the%20Senate%20and%20the%20House%20Official.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would declare people have a right to abortion unless there is a “compelling state interest.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Roe balanced the right to obtain an abortion and health of the pregnant person with the potential life of a fetus, constitutionally protecting access within a state would operate similarly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear what the language of the next attempted abortion amendment  would be but Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield — who plans to co-sponsor it again — said there will be more to discuss later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are still working on the language to ensure that our constitutional amendment effectively protects safe and legal access to abortion in Virginia.”</span></p>

Jen Kiggans faces Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal this year in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District. Both Navy veterans have been involved in their local communities for years – Kiggans as a former state senator and Smasal as a member of the Chesapeake Bay Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both women share some priorities, like reducing inflation and the costs of living, their divergence on abortion policy is something Smasal and Democrats are hoping can help flip the district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Kiggans and Republicans hope that maintaining control of the House of Representatives can put America closer to completing former president Donald Trump’s proposal of building a wall along the U.S. &#8211; Mexico border. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District: Republican lean, pockets of Democratic support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_39960" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1490px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/va02-map_supreme-court-of-virginia/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39960 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png" alt="" width="1490" height="1008" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia.png 1490w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-300x203.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-1024x693.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/VA02-map_Supreme-Court-of-Virginia-768x520.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1490px) 100vw, 1490px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia Congressional District 2 (courtesy Supreme Court of Virginia)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A drive along Route 13 on the Eastern Shore shows Kiggans signs sprinkled along much of the highway, signaling the district’s Republican lean. But pockets in Northampton and Accomack went for Kiggan’s Democratic opponent Elaine Luria in 2022, as did portions of Chesapeake, Suffolk and Isle of Wight on Virginia’s mainland. Much of Virginia Beach, which anchors the district, is also Republican territory, but 51% of the area </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/localities/virginia-beach-city-va/election-results-map/?electype=general&amp;election=10135" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed up for President Joe Biden in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite the GOP lean, the district has oscillated between the parties over the years and is among several competitive ones in Virginia and around the nation to help determine partisan control of the U.S. House of Representatives. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Candidates’ local impact</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal said constituent services is something that most excites her about potentially becoming a congresswoman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s one of the most interesting parts,” she said. “And when I go across the district and (people) have stories for me … they remember when somebody in Elaine Luria’s congressional office helped them out.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans, whose campaign did not follow through on organizing an interview with The Mercury, has kicked it local with some of her advertising. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent digital advertisements featured the refrain “</span><a href="https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1834947865824612859" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that’s Jen Kiggans!</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” as people noted some of her voting records to include supporting veteran health care. Home to the largest naval base in America, veterans and active duty service members make up a sizable portion of the 2nd District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, she supported the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/8580" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” which includes funding for VA health care programs and benefits. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reproductive health</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they prepare for an upcoming debate next month, a poll from Christopher Newport University released on Sept. 13 showed Kiggans with a </span><a href="https://cnu.edu/news/2024/09/13-cnu-wason/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five point lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over Smasal. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also showed that surveyed voters trust Kiggans more with veterans’ concerns while Smasal is more trusted to handle reproductive rights issues like abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center shows 55% of Virginians believe abortion should be </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religious-landscape-study/database/state/virginia/views-about-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in all or most cases. A top issue for Smasal, she hopes it’s key to unseating Kiggans so that she can help restore federal protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are talking to me constantly about protecting reproductive rights,” Smasal said. “It&#8217;s really the number one thing that I&#8217;m hearing from people they&#8217;re concerned about.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal took issue with Kiggans last year over how the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act played out when it passed the House and failed to progress in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was part of a hullabaloo between parties with President Joe Biden’s administration </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/H.R.-8580-%E2%80%94-Military-Construction-and-Veterans-Affairs-and-Related-Agencies-Appropriations-Act-2025-SAP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposing it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in part, for a provision that would revoke veteran access to funding should they need to travel out of state for an abortion if the location of their duty assignment bans the procedure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in the U.S. Senate Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2023/12/05/tuberville-relents-on-months-long-blockade-of-most-military-nominees-blaming-democrats/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held up military promotions in protest over the Biden administration’s VA  abortion travel policy.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At the time, Kiggans told the media that she didn’t agree with his method but supported his reasons.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Taxpayers should not be funding elective procedures,” she </span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/politics/local-lawmakers-react-to-block-of-hundreds-of-military-promotions-by-alabama-senator-over-abortion-policy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told an NBC affiliate in Hampton Roads </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last summer. “If I wanted to get a Hollywood nose job in California, I do not expect the Navy to pay for my travel expenses to get there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Smasal stressed the complexities of why someone may want or medically need an abortion and how the national patchwork of state laws is creating various additional barriers for people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know how any female veteran could do that to other service women,” Smasal told Virginia Mercury in a recent interview.  &#8220;She went to Congress and voted to restrict reproductive rights, so she&#8217;s chosen to be more extreme.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>But Kiggans took aim at Smasal in a <a href="https://x.com/JenKiggans/status/1839824215807078560" target="_blank">recent video on her social media</a> and asserted that Smasal is lying when referring to Kiggans as someone who is &#8220;extreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the video, Kiggans cited her status as the 19th most bipartisan member of congress from a <a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/ourwork-Bipartisan-Index.html" target="_blank">Lugar Center and Georgetown University ranking report</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it is an issue that should be legislated at the state level,&#8221; Kiggans added to clarify her abortion policy preferences. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been an advocate for women to choose life, allowing for exceptions in the cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no mention of <a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank">fetal anomalies</a>, many of which are detected at or after 15 weeks of gestation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Kiggans supports abortion laws being up to individual states, she has also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/13/virginia-democrats-do-not-support-infanticide-but-heres-why-trump-keeps-saying-they-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoed a false claim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Democrats support it to “</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the moment of birth.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>
<p>On other reproductive health laws, both women have expressed support for protecting contraception access and family planning procedures like in vitro fertilization. As<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the incumbent, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans has </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4626/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted for expanded contraception access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://mace.house.gov/media/press-releases/protecting-fertility-rights-urgent-legislation-addressing-deepening-concerns" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cosponsored a resolution to protect IVF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration views</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Immigration policy has featured prominently in both presidential and congressional campaigns this year. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans and Democrats tend to diverge on solutions when it comes to concerns about immigration. Republicans have favored ramping up deportations of people who enter America illegally while Democrats have proposed enhancing pathways to U.S. citizenship. This year, Democrats in congress worked with Republicans on </span><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/05/24/bipartisan-border-bill-loses-support-fails-procedural-vote-in-u-s-senate/#:~:text=By%3A%20Ariana%20Figueroa%20%2D%20May%2024%2C%202024%207%3A15%20am&amp;text=The%20Senate%20bill%20failed%20to,aid%20package%20earlier%20this%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosting funding for border security, but the efforts failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody&#8217;s done enough to fix things,” Smasal said. “Both Democrats and Republicans have failed on this issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she was glad to see Democrats coming to the table with Republicans on the bipartisan border deal that was toppled earlier this year. It’s something she would have supported and something Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/10/harris-slams-trump-for-killing-border-bill-in-debate-here-are-the-facts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said she would support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Republicans in Congress and Trump) wanted the political issue (for this election) as opposed to doing something substantial to actually help address the border,” Smasal said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She stressed how supporting border security efforts can help detect drugs like fentanyl entering the country and combat human trafficking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I firmly believe we need to be security minded,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On related legislation, Kiggans has co-sponsored the “</span><a href="https://chavez-deremer.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/chavez-deremer.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Summary%20-%20Defending%20Borders,%20Defending%20Democracies%20Act.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defending Borders, Defending Democracies Act.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” The </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7372/cosponsors%5C" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has not progressed past introduction, would suspend entry of some immigrants at the U.S. border and require asylum seekers to “remain in Mexico” during adjudication of their immigration status. </span></p>
<p>She also voted for the &#8220;<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/2/all-actions" target="_blank">Secure The Border Act</a>&#8221; which would expedite construction of border barriers. It passed the House but did not clear the Senate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On her website, Kiggans called the rise in border crossings a “self-inflicted crisis” that is “threatening the safety of Americans and emboldening cartels, which are making massive profits off of drug trafficking and exploiting vulnerable migrants.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Addressing inflation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a local-yet-national issue, both candidates have stressed how they want to curb inflation and rising costs of living. Kiggans’ campaign website points to her support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746/summary/00#:~:text=This%20bill%20increases%20the%20federal,work%20requirements%20for%20federal%20programs." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which passed congress and was signed into law by the president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that addressing affordable housing is a key part of addressing the cost of living. If elected, she aims to start by championing federal legislation to prevent large corporations from purchasing housing stock and raising prices or creating more short-term rentals in places like Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If everything is turned into an Airbnb, where are our teachers and our firefighters and our police officers going to find their housing?” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both women are also supportive of ways to help </span><a href="https://kiggans.house.gov/posts/kiggans-supports-bipartisan-bill-to-address-childcare-workforce-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleviate the nation’s growing childcare cost and access issues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans called it an “unfortunate reality” that some parents are feeling forced to leave the workforce, take on debt or tap into their savings as a result of the growing issue. </span></p>

Though he has not formally outlined specific proposals, the report noted previous comments from Trump and his vice presidential pick U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, and previous actions he took when president — such as his </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/55195" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FY2020 budget proposal that would have cut federal support for health care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Trump’s other actions as president illustrate his opposition to a long-debated topic between Republicans and Democrats: the Affordable Care Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often referred to as “Obamacare” by its opponents, the ACA was a hallmark of former democratic president Barack Obama’s administration. The act established a public insurance marketplace and prevented insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Trump’s first day as president in 2017, he issued an </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/01/24/2017-01799/minimizing-the-economic-burden-of-the-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-pending-repeal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order to prompt its repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He also </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-gop-leaders-take-victory-lap-after-house-passes-trumpcare-n754896" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a repeal effort that passed the House before it failed in the Senate. In 2020 he also </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/us/politics/obamacare-trump-administration-supreme-court.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before the U.S. Supreme Court that sought to tear down ACA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, over 20 million people </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2024-open-enrollment-period-report-final-national-snapshot" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">utilize it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">nationwide and nearly 400,000 Virginians could  pay more for their health insurance if the ACA were repealed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example of what could be lost, the Harris campaign’s Virginia-based team used a Kaiser Family Foundation </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator/#state=va&amp;zip=23450&amp;income-type=percent&amp;income=325&amp;employer-coverage=0&amp;people=4&amp;alternate-plan-family=&amp;adult-count=2&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=45&amp;adults%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Bage%5D=45&amp;adults%5B1%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;child-count=2&amp;children%5B0%5D%5Bage%5D=10&amp;children%5B0%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0&amp;children%5B1%5D%5Bage%5D=8&amp;children%5B1%5D%5Btobacco%5D=0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calculator tool</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to show how a middle class family based in Virginia Beach is currently eligible for about $9,000 per year as a premium tax credit to offset their coverage costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his debate with Harris in early September, Trump said that he has “concepts of a plan” when it comes to health care policy if re-elected. He added that there are “concepts and options” for a cheaper system that he will outline in the “not-too-distant future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also takes aim at Trump’s “concepts” quote and the fact that he’s yet to fully articulate what his plans are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Trump and Vance) may not want Americans to see the details of their plan, but Vice President Harris and Governor Walz won’t let them get away with hiding its effects,” Harris campaign senior policy advisor Brian Nelson said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But formal outlines should be on the horizon, Trump’s team said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As President Trump said, he will release more details, but his overall position on health care remains the same: bring down costs and increase the quality of care by improving competition in the marketplace,” Trump’s national campaign secretary Karolina Leavitt said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report was released ahead of a vice presidential debate on Tuesday where Harris’ running-mate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minnesota, will face off against Vance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When pressed about their healthcare proposals on a recent episode of “Meet the Press,” </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4880616-jd-vance-donald-trump-health-care/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a lot of it comes down… to deregulating the insurance market so that people can choose a plan that actually makes sense for them.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a recent event in North Carolina, Vance also suggested a plan to </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/09/18/vance-targets-inflation-immigration-at-raleigh-event/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate patients into different health insurance pools based on individual risks.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leavitt, of Trump’s campaign, accused Harris of showing “support for a socialist government takeover of our healthcare system that would force people off their private plans and result in lower quality care.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accusation stems from Harris’ previous co-sponsorship of a “Medicare For All” bill when still a U.S. Senator as well as her </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/kamala-harris-wants-end-private-health-insurance-new-democratic-litmus-n964241?_nlid=QjzdJemnN7&amp;_nhids=PolxhrO3Xn" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">embrace of it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">during her 2019 bid for president. </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/19/medicare-for-all-harris-progressives-2024-elections-00174447" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has since moved away from that stance </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">which has been popular with the more progressive wings of the Democratic party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ recent health care proposals have included protecting the ACA and continuing price negotiations on medications that started as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, a measure for which she cast the tie-breaking vote to proceed. A price </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/4829873-trump-biden-insulin-price-cap/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cap on insulin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has emerged as a debate within a debate for Trump, as his administration had implemented a temporary cap on the drug while the Inflation Reduction Act made the cap law unless it is repealed by future congressional action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Harris-Walz campaign infers that Trump and Vance’s “message to America is: ‘you’re on your own.’”</span></p>

(Screenshot courtesy U.S. Senate Budget Committee livestream)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON – Conversations about things like zoning laws, permits, or use of housing subsidies typically happen in city or county government chambers rather than those of the U.S. Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But people in localities across the nation, including Virginia, are experiencing the persistent challenges of finding and affording a place to live. So, the <a href="https://www.budget.senate.gov/hearings/the-costs-of-inaction-economic-risks-from-housing-unaffordability" target="_blank">Senate&#8217;s budget committee had a hearing Wednesday</a> to listen to a cohort of various housing experts about ways the federal government can help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As housing costs outpace wages, today more than 10 million Americans spend over half of their income on housing — leaving little for essentials like food, healthcare and education,” said Greta Harris, president and CEO of the Richmond-based Better Housing Coalition, who was a guest speaker at the hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also noted ripple effects that stem from housing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This suppresses consumer demand and hampers economic growth,” Harris added. “Businesses in both urban and rural areas struggle to attract and retain talent because workers can’t afford to live nearby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state and local level, Virginia is already spearheading some targeted solutions. A state commission recently launched a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/workforce-housing-pilot-launches-to-support-southern-and-southwestern-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">workforce housing pilot program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s southwestern and Southside regions, and the city of Richmond earmarked money in its budget to create a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/19/could-this-right-to-counsel-program-for-evictions-become-a-statewide-model/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right-to-counsel program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for people facing evictions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developers around Virginia and America continue to tap into use of federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits to bolster construction of below-market-rate housing available to certain percentages of area median income. Expanding the federal program was floated by several senators during the hearing (and is part of Vice President </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamala Harris’ housing plans </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">if elected president). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, of the Better Housing Coalition, said that LIHTC has been an “extremely effective” tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker of Rhode Island’s house of representatives, Joseph Shekarchi, was also a guest at the hearing. He shared his perspective pressing for </span><a href="https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2024/02/05/rhode-island-needs-to-pick-up-the-pace-to-tackle-affordable-housing-crisis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various housing policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Rhode Island’s legislature, such as streamlining permitting and appeals processes for developments and investments in its housing production fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can do all the policy programming we want, but if a child doesn’t have a safe place to sleep, what does it all mean?” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a state lawmaker, he implored Congress to provide “greater funding mechanisms and grant opportunities to develop more housing, foster public-private partnerships, and to see further expansion of financial assistance” for renters and first-time homebuyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Republican senators and some guest speakers cautioned against more government spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, took particular aim at Harris’ proposal of $25,000 in downpayment assistance for first-time homebuyers. If elected president, that plan would hinge on congressional approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His concern was echoed by guest speaker Ed Pinto, co-director of AEI Housing Center, a conservative think tank.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinto said Harris’ proposal is “almost certain to lead to higher home prices, thereby, more than eliminating the intended benefits. Millions of program recipients would become price setters in their neighborhood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He projected the downpayment assistance would cost the U.S. $100 billion over four years and wouldn’t help with supply issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This would be a wealth transfer to existing homeowners and really rewarding NIMBY opposition to additional supply,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NIMBY, which stands for “not in my backyard,” is a casual term used when discussing housing policy for people who oppose new developments or types of developments.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, lawmakers and the guest speakers agreed that increased housing supply will help with affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinto did thank Virginia’s senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner along with Van Hollen, D-Md., for their introduction of the LIFT Act, which draws inspiration from Pinto’s own proposals. The Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act would offer 20-year mortgages to first-time buyers whose incomes don’t exceed a certain threshold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner joked to Pinto that he might need help recruiting some Republicans onto the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also noted bipartisan consensus on </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/09/white-house-gop-housing-federal-land-00170616" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">selling off some vacant federally-owned land for new housing construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., asked if housing issues should be best handled by local governments and the private sector, Harris of the Better Housing Coalition responded that the federal government can help with a power check. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Left to its own devices, the market is not equitable and it serves certain portions of our society and not all,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where encouragement of local zoning reforms by the state and federal government could help localities increase their supply through more development. From his perspective as a Rhode Island state lawmaker, Shekarchi said localities are going to need all the help they can get.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need federal subsidies. We need land use reform on a local level. We need the federal government to step in, because the states and the local communities cannot do it alone.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers in Virginia and other states want to strengthen privacy laws regarding the non-consensual distribution of intimate images. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-nine states including Virginia already have some law on the books to protect peoples’  sexual or intimate images from being shared without their consent, but model policy from former democratic House of Delegates candidate Susanna Gibson provides a blueprint for lawmakers to use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue took center stage in Gibson’s campaign last year, when news media was alerted to sex videos she and her husband had streamed online. Though the married couple had consented to the content that they streamed together being published on a particular pornography website, they did not consent to the content being recorded or widely disseminated beyond their audience of followers on that website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screenshots of Gibson’s nude body then circulated on social media along with derogatory language by online users. The </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/susanna-gibson-chatterbate-video-porn-republican-party-of-virginia/article_d1e5aaa6-72a8-11ee-92c9-afa9a79d1c01.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Party of Virginia later sent out campaign mailers with cropped, explicit photos of Gibson. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point a false emergency call had been placed to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/henrico-officers-sent-to-susanna-gibsons-house-on-a-false-call/article_8c021524-69f2-11ee-83b2-3f32185898ed.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">send law enforcement to her home — an act colloquially referred to as “swatting.” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gibson also </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/susanna-gibson-revenge-porn-virginia-lawmaker/article_aef20e14-9089-11ee-9f6a-4f33e3f98a70.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said that people loitered outside of her home and she received death threats.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the fallout, Gibson also said prospective young women political candidates in other states had reached out to her. Learning her story had them concerned that ex-partners could someday share nude images of them, and made them afraid to run for office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I quickly realized that my path had shifted from candidacy to advocacy,” Gibson said in a press call Wednesday to announce model policy from her organization, MyOwn Image. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year Gibson worked with Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax to expand the statute of limitations for prosecutions of unlawful dissemination of images in Virginia. The new model policy, which Gibson and MyOwn board members say six states are planning to implement, would create various tiers of misdemeanor and felony penalties for unlawful dissemination and remove language that requires proof of intent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Florida lawmaker Katherine Waldron said the measure is important because without the consent of the person whose image is being shared, the intent to cause them harm, or lack thereof, doesn’t erase the harm that happens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and several other lawmakers that joined the press call relayed how victims’ mental health, personal relationships, employment or ability to find employment can be negatively impaired. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While several speakers acknowledged that anyone can become a victim of their image being shared without their consent, they noted how it often happens to women, minors or victims of sex trafficking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey assemblywoman Jessica Ramirez also noted how the crime could deter women from office, echoing Gibson’s concern, or be used as an intimidation tactic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that women still have a long way to go with representation in our halls of power,” she said. “So when these images are shared or used as a threat, it really can impact elections. It can impact someone’s desire to step up and run for office. We have to take action now to ensure that anyone can engage in public service without fear of intimidation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia delegates Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield and Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, plan to build on Virginia’s law using the model policy, they said. Coyner, who was inspired to carry the legislation as the mother of teen daughters, expressed concerns about artificial intelligence as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rapid rise of (artificial intelligence) image generation software has heightened the threat posed by non consensual disclosure of intimate images,” Coyner said. “I know fellow parents are familiar with the harms and risks of social media and cyberbullying, but the increased risk posed by digitally forged intimate images make these issues much more severe.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, South Carolina is the only state without existing protections against non-consensual distribution of intimate images. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Miss South Carolina Jill Dudley joined the call along with the state’s deputy attorney general and Republican state representative Chris Wooten. All will press for the creation of a law based on the model policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dudley, who advocates for protections and support for survivors of rape and sexual assault, stressed that distributing someone’s intimate image, whether real or artificial, fits within the scope of rape culture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rape culture thrives when we blame or shame victims, when we dismiss their trauma, or when we fail to address sexual violence in all of its forms.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal judges in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond on Tuesday appeared sympathetic to the plaintiffs in a case challenging Virginia’s disenfranchisement of people with felony convictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a federal district judge </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/18/judge-rules-suit-against-virginia-felon-disenfranchisement-rule-can-proceed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed the challenge to move forward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year, alleging that </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-voting-rights-aclu-virginia/article_90a9275e-e565-11ee-8466-3ff35b49eb1c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has been out of compliance with a Reconstruction-era federal law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the 4th Circuit had a hearing on the state’s attempt to toss the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy Solicitor General Kevin Gallagher, in defense of the state, said the “unique” and old federal statute “is not something that people are trying to enforce.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defendants include Gov. Glenn Youngkin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth — who was Kay Coles James when the suit was first filed — and several election officials. Tuesday’s hearing was part of their interlocutory appeal limited to whether Virginia is entitled to sovereign immunity — basically, whether or not the state and its agents can be found to have done wrong or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interlocutory appeal is a type of appeal that can be filed while a case is active and before a final judgment. Neither the interlocutory appeal nor the Readmission Act case have been ruled on yet. And though the appeal was the point of Tuesday’s meeting, discussion veered into the Readmission case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter is focused on the 1870 Virginia Readmission Act, a federal law that allowed Virginia, a former Confederate state, to rejoin the U.S. Congress. Similar laws were also employed as other formerly Confederate states rejoined, with the condition that states’ constitutions could not be used to deprive anyone of voting rights, “except as punishment for such crimes that are now felonies at common law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Common law” felonies were defined as a limited set of crimes, whereas today people with any felony conviction in Virginia permanently lose the right to vote unless a governor restores it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our claim is that essentially, Virginia made a promise when it was brought back into the United States Congress. It’s now time to keep that promise and to abide by the Virginia Readmission Act,” said ACLU attorney Vishal Agraharkar in a call with The Mercury on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the defendants’ filing argues that Congress lacks the power to prohibit states from disenfranchising people with felony convictions under the Fourteenth Amendment in the U.S. Constitution and that states could choose to permanently disenfranchise people with felonies of all types, not just those in common law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Tuesday hearing, Judge Roger Gregory noted Congress’ intent when using the Readmission Acts following the Civil War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Congress) knew what (formerly-Confederate states) were going to do to newly-freed persons — they didn’t trust them,” Gregory said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallager argued that the act was more limited to that time as a “contract between Congress and Virginia” to reenter the Union. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU is working on the case with the WilmerHale law firm and a voting rights group called Protect Democracy. Plaintiffs are Virginians with felony convictions who have tried to have their rights restored by Youngkin without success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while it’s Virginia’s constitution which grants governors purview over restoration of rights that is at the core of the Readmission Act case, Youngkin has been at the center of legal challenges to restorations under his administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A once automatic process, Youngkin’s administration adjusted it last year to a petition-based one. As </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers have dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under his tenure as governor, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have sprung up </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/judge-rejects-lawsuit-but-compares-youngkins-power-to-restore-voting-rights-to-a-kings/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking answers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about criteria for restorations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a case by a man who sought answers about his restoration rejection was dismissed, the judge presiding over that case opined that “much like a monarch, the governor receives petitions for relief, may or may not rule upon them, and, when he does rule, need not explain his reasons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Gregory was curious about criteria Tuesday as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do we know what the governor’s role is, really?” he posited. “Do we have facts, depositions about how that works and ‘how does he filter them out?’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then suggested that a deposition would be the “best way” to glean information “for the only person that can restore rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court made no decision on the merits of the interlocutory appeal. From there, the Readmission Act case could potentially continue to be discussed and advance closer to a ruling. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia launched a workforce housing pilot program this summer aimed at both attracting economic development to the southern and southwestern portions of the state and bolstering local affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With $2 million in allocated funding, the Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission launched the program in late July. For-profit and nonprofit developers can now </span><a href="https://revitalizeva.org/economic-development-workforce-housing-incentive-pilot-program/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">apply for the funding on a rolling basis </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to help with site development, infrastructure, or direct housing construction costs. The units built with the funding can be  for purchase or for rent, but the goal is to help people live where they work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have all heard the stories about folks being priced out of homes or unable to buy,” said Stephen Versen, deputy director of the Virginia Tobacco Region Revitalization Commission. “While that is of course a serious issue, the economic development impact of having a lack of workforce housing can also be huge.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more companies are </span><a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/hitting-the-jackpot/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">developing worksites in rural areas of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — contributing factors for job and population growth — the lack of affordable housing is becoming too hard to ignore, noted Del. Danny Marshall, R- Danville, a member of the commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also pointed to an upcoming </span><a href="https://www.ialr.org/third-annual-southern-virginia-regional-housing-summit/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing summit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> taking place in the area next month where contractors, bankers, home renovators, architects and community housing advocates are encouraged to attend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Versen said that as of mid-September, four applications have been received through the online portal and several localities have reached out to learn more about the pilot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a new pilot so we’re excited to see what we can learn and I hope a decision can be made on awards by May (2025) at the latest,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tobacco Region Commission will have had a few meetings by then and applications will have more formally progressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Marshall pointed to the Berry Hill megasite in Pittsylvania County as a prime example of where the program could be implemented. The publicly-owned space spans over 3,500 acres near Danville and has emerged as a development-ready site that could attract various companies in the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s gonna take a while to build,” he said of some ongoing developments at Berry Hill. “So at the same time, we wanted to go ahead and help with workforce housing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Berry Hill continues to catch the eye of businesses — some of which may want to tap into the workforce housing program — fellow commission member Sen. Lashresce Aird, D-Petersburg, noted how the program can help boost other areas of Virginia’s former Tobacco Region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her district, anchored in Petersburg, spans southward to include Sussex, Surry, Dinwiddie and Prince George counties along with the city of Hopewell. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As parts of her district and others in the commission’s purview seek to attract new industries, “housing continues to be a big strain on how we&#8217;re going to get workers to come here.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aird said that not only can the program help with affordable housing options but it can “further attract a new industry or company to look in a place where they might not have looked before.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested applicants can submit </span></i><a href="https://revitalizeva.org/ninja-forms/68hlh/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span></i><a href="https://revitalizeva.org/economic-development-workforce-housing-incentive-pilot-program/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional details </span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are on the commission’s website.</span></i></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting Friday, voters across Virginia can begin casting their ballots in this year’s critical elections for the White House, a U.S. Senate seat, and  the state’s 11 congressional districts that will not only impact the future of the commonwealth but also help shape next year’s gubernatorial race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/election-law/proposed-amendments-for-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Constitution of Virginia and a variety of local offices are also on the ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Sep. 20 kick-off of the 45-day early voting period, Virginians have the option to vote in person until Nov. 2 at their local election offices or send absentee ballots by mail. This marks a turning point in campaign season, as both parties ramp up rallies and events to energize their bases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just south of Richmond, Gov. Glenn Youngkin will attend a rally at Chesterfield County Airport Saturday. He will be joined by U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, Bill Moher, the Republican nominee in Virginia’s 4th Congressional District, and Hung Cao, who is seeking to oust U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin in a statement Thursday encouraged “every Virginia citizen to make a plan and vote early” to ensure that each vote is counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can trust that Virginia’s elections are secure with clean voter rolls, secure paper ballots, certified counting machines and well-trained election officials,” he said. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin at an early voting rally in Henrico County in 2023. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on Saturday, Youngkin will join Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in the 7th District, at an Early Voting Rally at the Professional Building Maintenance in Fredericksburg. The event is set to begin at 1:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump has yet to return to the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign trail in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a state where he trails Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by several percentage points </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/new-polling-finds-harris-ahead-of-trump-by-a-comfortable-margin-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to recent polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Rally Virginia is hosting a Women’s Rally for the Republican presidential nominee at the Trump Winery in Charlottesville on Saturday. The event  starts at 2 p.m., featuring guest speaker U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-NY.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Team Trump Virginia has been working diligently to ensure an impressive  — and winning — performance in Virginia’s early vote. Across the commonwealth, we have been priming our voters to turn out in record numbers. Trump Force 47 will be mobilizing our supporters to vote,” said Jeff Ryer, a campaign spokesman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While much of Southwest Virginia leans Republican, Democrats are firing up their bases there with some events, like an early voting kickoff event in Roanoke Friday to support Democratic candidates for city council and mayor, a canvassing kickoff on Saturday in Bristol with local elected officials, ad a Sunday gathering in Montgomery County with 9th District Democratic nominee Karen Baker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urging citizens of the Southwest region of the state to take advantage of early voting, Bristol city councilor Neil Osborne said, “Don’t risk having something unexpected come up on Election Day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine will jaunt around the state for various early voting events over the weekend to support Democratic congressional candidates in competitive races — such as Eugene Vindman in the 7th District, Suhas Subramanyam in the 10th and Missy Cotter Smasal in the 2nd — and to boost his own re-election campaign. </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday gatherings will also be hosted with Democratic challengers Leslie Mehta in Chesterfield County, who wants to unseat Wittman and 5th District candidate Gloria Witt. The 5th District election </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/16/amid-internal-gop-feud-in-the-5th-district-democrat-gloria-witt-sees-her-chance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could test the effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of GOP infighting over nominee John McGuire, a state senator from Goochland, and Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, whose supporters have mounted a write-in campaign after the incumbent lost his primary this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we’ve already held over 1,000 events across the Commonwealth, but (there’s) more to come,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Party of Virginia chairwoman Susan Swecker. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a big week with the kickoff for early voting.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On boosting awareness of the different campaigns and to encourage early voting, Swecker said that Democrats have opened 25 campaign offices around the state and hired 150 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As election seasons become increasingly competitive, early voting has emerged as a vital part of the electoral process, and Virginia is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early voting allows voters to participate on their own schedules, whether by visiting local election offices or mailing in absentee ballots. In recent elections, both parties have recognized its significance — a shift that is reshaping the strategies of political campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voters like the convenience of early voting options,” said Mark Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University. “Importantly, Republicans have adjusted to the reality that early voting is here to stay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Youngkin’s political action committee </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/glenn-youngkin-virginia-politics-election-day/article_f250116c-6936-11ee-9bad-2b7f054e466e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invested millions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the promotion of early voting initiatives, following years of GOP opposition to the expanded options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Past GOP leadership claims that early voting leads to fraud likely had some negative impact on Republican turnout,” Rozell said. “The smart strategy now is to embrace the reality and use flexible voting options as a means to mobilize core supporters.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But opponents of early voting are not devoid of credible arguments, Rozell added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot can happen in October that might affect the viewpoints of those who voted in Virginia in late September. You can’t take it back once you’ve voted, so you better be sure when you vote that your opinion will not change under any circumstance.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ways to vote early</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To vote early in-person, registered voters may go to the general registrar’s office for the jurisdiction in which they are registered, present their ID and cast a ballot. The location of the general registrar’s offices for all jurisdictions can be found on the Virginia Department of Elections’ </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/PublicContactLookup" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in addition to </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/voterid/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of acceptable forms of identification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requested absentee ballots will also be mailed beginning Friday, including ballots to registered military and overseas voters. Any registered voter can request an absentee ballot either in person, by mail, </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by contacting their general registrar’s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registered voters do not need a reason to request an absentee ballot, which can be dropped off at the general registrar’s office or polling location on Election Day. Absentee ballots returned by mail must be postmarked no later than Nov. 5 and received by noon on Nov. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline to request a mailed absentee ballot is Oct. 25, but amid national U.S. Postal Service delays, state officials suggest those voting by mail </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/05/virginias-top-elections-official-warns-of-possible-delays-in-mail-in-voting-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">do so as soon as possible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline to register to vote and cast a regular ballot is Oct. 15. After that date, voters can still register and vote on Election Day using same-day registration, but they will cast a provisional ballot. Same-day registration must be done in person, either at an early voting location within the voter’s jurisdiction or at their polling place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some jurisdictions offer early in-person voting at satellite locations in addition to the general registrar’s office. Dates and times vary by j</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/early-voting-office-locations/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urisdiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curbside voting is available for voters with disabilities and those 65 and older who prefer to vote in person. For details on voting hours, additional locations, and ballot drop boxes, contact your local registrar&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OEMS is currently part of the Virginia Department of Health and oversees funding and programming for Virginia’s emergency medical services. This includes purchasing and maintaining equipment and ambulances as well as training first responders. As a result of financial issues in recent years, some trauma centers have received state funding late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key findings in the audit revealed in a presentation on Wednesday included multi-million dollar contracts that bypassed state procurement rules by being routed through a Regional EMS Council and dedicated rescue squad funding used to cover costs for a symposium, inflated operating expenses and EMS-related technology. Seven laptops were purchased outside of procurement processes and have since been lost, the audit revealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audit also showed that the office purchased shuttle vehicles to transport fire and rescue squad members to a symposium they attended previously, along with $9,000 spent on alcohol.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this year&#8217;s symposium having since been canceled, Winchester Fire and Rescue Chief Jon Henschel was frustrated by the missed learning opportunity for paramedics and other first responders. It’s just one of the “negative impacts downstream,” he said in an interview.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health Commissioner Karen Shelton requested the audit when she noticed irregularities last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One piece of the $33 million  puzzle has included Adam Harrell, a former director in the office, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/health-care/adam-harrell-department-of-health-ems/article_5f4258b8-4abc-11ef-9745-a356984ae776.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pleading guilty to embezzlement of over $4 million.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The report confirmed that he used one of the Regional EMS Councils to pay a fraudulent company he owned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reflecting on the past year during the audit presentation Sept18, Shelton said that Harrell was able to “use and abuse (his) OEMS position of power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelton and Chief Operating Officer Christopher Lindsay noted changes the department has made in the past year to improve accountability and avoid errors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This year has been a difficult year for all of us,” Shelton said.  “As we have processed these financial deficits as well as the fraudulent activity, we&#8217;ve put in place measures to prevent this from happening again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OEMS has held regular briefings with VDH, they said, and a new director is being hired who will sign off on expenses. Contracts that were previously handled by Regional EMS councils have been centralized back to OEMS or canceled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, revamped procedures now ensure that dedicated funding is dispensed properly and there are set benchmarks for recipients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have changed the way that we will pay out money to trauma centers in the state,” Lindsay said. “We&#8217;re moving from an annual payment to a biannual payment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDH had also tapped consulting firm Fitch &amp; Associates to compile recommendations for OEMS’ future operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were no checks and balances within the system,” said Todd Sheridan, who presented on behalf of the firm. In the first week of his company’s review of the department, he said that they found roughly 500 unpaid invoices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also listed several of more than 60 reform recommendations that the department could take. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideas include reorganizing OEMS’ leadership structure and creating a dedicated business operations manager to consult on financial decisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sheridan noted other potential configurations that would put OEMS under other departments instead of VDH, which would require state legislation.  Those options included merging the state emergency department with the Department of Fire Programs or OEMS establishing itself within the Department of Public Safety. Another option, he said, would be disbanding OEMS altogether and allowing other departments to absorb its duties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another idea was to reduce Virginia’s 11 Regional EMS Councils to seven (it was a regional council that Harrell pleaded guilty to routing fraudulent payments through). The councils were created through state code to address region-specific needs for emergency responses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Regional EMS Councils Director’s Group handed out white papers at the meeting that contextualized their stances. The group advocated for continuing with 11 councils and codifying dedicated funding for the regional councils to use. The papers also noted the group’s support for stricter oversight mechanisms for VDH and OEMS to prevent financial mismanagement. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A committee of state lawmakers met in Virginia’s Eastern Shore this week as part of ongoing gatherings to hear from health care providers and other experts about rural health care challenges and possible solutions. The cohort will deliver a report later this year with recommendations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Topics at the meetings have been broadly about rural health care access. But there has also been time dedicated to specific issues like maternal health care gaps, sparse dental health care in some areas, regulatory hurdles in treating obesity and challenges to telehealth amid insufficient broadband infrastructure.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="joIlnekS81"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/rural-health-committee-hears-from-maternal-health-dental-specialists-in-farmville/">Rural health committee hears from maternal health, dental specialists in Farmville</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Rural health committee hears from maternal health, dental specialists in Farmville&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/rural-health-committee-hears-from-maternal-health-dental-specialists-in-farmville/embed/#?secret=tEd9OH5dAW#?secret=joIlnekS81" data-secret="joIlnekS81" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation issues and health care workforce shortages were common refrains at their first meeting in Tazewell this May and their Farmville meeting in June and were repeated again at the Sept. 16 Eastern Shore meeting this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it’s due to a lack of access to a car, fewer public transportation options, or increased travel time compared to urban areas, rural health care providers relayed that patients often miss follow up appointments or have to travel further for emergency care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Southside also has fewer hospitals than other parts of the state. And though Southwest Virginia has a cluster of providers, both regions are experiencing the closure of obstetric units — fueling maternal healthcare disparities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the rural health committee works on proposing enterprising solutions to these problems, they may also look at ways to build on existing state programs or funding. For example, to help alleviate maternal workforce issues, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding was earmarked in Virginia&#8217;s current budget for OB-GYN medical residencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Virginia’s Department of Medical Assistance Services has a program to support non-emergency medical transportation for some Medicaid patients, boosting transportation options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got something that’s at least serving some people,” committee chair Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico said of the DMAS program. “Can we leverage that? Is there a way to expand that for non-Medicaid folks who have certain income levels or live in certain areas? Can we fund that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some issues may be addressed or supported s by state funding, there are also regulatory routes to solutions through legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willett noted how <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/rural-health-committee-hears-from-maternal-health-dental-specialists-in-farmville/">midwives have played a role</a> in Southside’s maternal health care problems. Though not OB-GYNs, some midwives are nurses and they specialize in pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum care. In 2020 Virginia law allowed for the certification of nurse-midwives and a 2021 law allowed for those with over two years of experience to serve as consultants for newly-licensed midwives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The state can’t totally solve that crisis,” Willett said. “But we’ve got to start somewhere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blacksburg-area pharmacist Jeremy Counts called in to the meeting to talk about challenges independent pharmacies face, highlighting that these pharmacists will serve the areas of the state that national chains sometimes won’t. He’s hopeful for reimbursement reforms so that smaller pharmacies don’t continue to lose ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Independent pharmacies are in an existential crisis,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rx Partnership, a nonprofit that has coordinated the donation of bulk medicines from pharmaceutical manufacturers to clinics with licensed pharmacies, represents a point of progress on that front. Virginia’s General Assembly has already given funding to the organization and commended it through a resolution this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the topic of obesity was also a talking point at the Eastern Shore meeting this week, the state legislature could also explore adjusting criteria for Medicaid coverage of certain weight-loss treatments. Obesity is often tethered to other health conditions; it can contribute to some conditions, occur simultaneously with them, or be their root cause. While diet and exercise can play a role, exercise may be out of reach for those with debilitating chronic illnesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Something about being in the rural areas puts you at an increased risk of having obesity and diabetes,” said Lisa Price Stevens, a chief medical officer at DMAS, of the two often coexisting conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted how fresh produce, for example, can cost more sometimes than foods with less nutritional value while committee member Del. Otto Waschmann, R-Brunswick, described seeing fewer grocery stores in his district over time. When people have to travel further or have transportation hurdles to food markets, they are more likely to rely on whatever is readily available close by. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Susan Wolver, a VCU Health specialist who called into Monday’s meeting, recalled how treating obesity in one of her patients helped improve other aspects of her physical and mental health.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She relayed how she treated a breast cancer survivor who was struggling with depression and obesity along with a gap in employment. Being able to utilize her Medicaid coverage for an injectable medication helped her lose 100 pounds. This led to a domino effect of tackling her depression, finding new employment and finally being able to undergo breast reconstruction surgery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Wolver said, new criteria that took effect this past summer makes it harder for some of her patients to qualify for that type of coverage or other types of treatments. Patients must have certain, elevated Body Mass Index levels and/or have diabetes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wolver would rather patients be able to tackle obesity with medications sooner, if that’s the best course of treatment for them. She pointed to another patient who needs a kidney transplant, she said, but his BMI isn’t high enough for medication to be covered to help him lose weight to qualify for the surgery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s like waiting for cancer to metastasize before waiting for treatment,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group also discussed creating a Secretary of Rural Affairs role at the meeting. The possible position, which would extend beyond the healthcare sphere, would be able to focus on the unique issues experienced by rural communities around the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s nobody whose job it is to think about the rural communities (all the time),” said Andrew Block, a University of Virginia professor. “Even the governors who are most committed to rural communities just don’t have that kind of bandwidth to focus on that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to bipartisan efforts last year to study whether Virginia should create such a position that failed in the legislature. In an interview with the Mercury, Willett said he would be open to the study if the General Assembly were to take up such a bill again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the committee, composed of lawmakers from around the state, is expected to meet once more before their report is due. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are collecting our thoughts,” Willett said. “We’re trying to get what we’ve heard into a series of categories and within each of those, have a legislative or budget-related suggestion.”</span></p>

The state’s capital city, Richmond, has a mayoral election in November that could shape housing policy for at least the next four years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year council passed a</span><a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6112907&amp;GUID=93BD96AB-6A5A-40B4-A50B-A29A36C706FA&amp;Options=&amp;Search=" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resolution to declare that the city had a housing crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Efforts to help will be paramount for the city’s legislative body and next mayor because Richmond’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/19/could-this-right-to-counsel-program-for-evictions-become-a-statewide-model/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eviction rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is second highest in the nation, the amount of people experiencing homelessness is </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-08-26/homeward-greater-richmond-continuum-of-care-homeless-report-july-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the city has not been immune to national struggles for people to </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2023/10/23/richmond-housing-affordability-six-figures" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">afford purchasing homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond’s five candidates for mayor — Andreas Addison, Danny Avula, Michelle Mosby, Maurice Neblett and Harrison Roday — share their ideas on this front, including dedicating more money to existing land trust funds, supporting updated zoning that will foster the development of more housing and diversify housing types, and furthering existing eviction diversion programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is an overview of some of their other proposals.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Land value taxes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having passed</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB725" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia law allows for the use of land value taxes, when property is taxed by the land and not the structure sitting on top of it. Addison, as a Richmond City Council member representing District 1, advocated for that law and asked then-state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, to carry it. Now he wants to see it put to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said this measure can help homeowners, particularly seniors and people on fixed incomes, to remain in their homes. Usually home sales in a neighborhood are what drives peoples’ tax assessments up over time and can push longer-term residents out of certain neighborhoods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Land value taxes could also spur action on vacant or blighted properties because it would become more costly to hold onto empty properties than to develop them. Addison noted empty lots and derelict buildings around Richmond that could become housing or mixed-use development if owners had a nudge to move forward on projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This strategy lowers the tax burden on residents and incentivizes investors who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sitting on valuable property to either sell it or develop it, which will spur the development </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of infill,” Addison said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fast tracking the approval process for affordable developments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosby, who represented District 9 as a city councilor 2013-2016, wants to create an Affordable Housing Strike Team, she said. It would be composed of key department heads involved in housing and development approvals within the city, their work overseen by her office as mayor to “ensure accountability and efficiency,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is simple — cut through the red tape and get affordable housing projects completed as quickly as possible,” Mosby said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Roday, who founded the community development nonprofit Bridging Virginia, plans to institute a “shot clock” approach to building permits in Richmond. When asked for more details of how that could work, he pointed to how</span><a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/BillLookUp/2023/H332" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> North Carolina’s state legislature has proposed a statewide mandate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to “set clear targets for results.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Resident feedback boards </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Roday and Avula plan to create advisory boards that can weigh in on housing policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more than half of the renters in Richmond </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/02/05/richmond-renters-cost-burden-unaffordable" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spend more than 30% of their income on rent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Roday’s board would have a focus on renters, he said. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Bolstering the Office of Community Wealth Building</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avula, a pediatrician and former director of the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wants to allocate additional funding for case workers in the Office of Community Wealth Building with a goal of helping low-income Richmonders be better able to raise their incomes — thus alleviating some of the strain of housing costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This level of intensive support gives families residing in (Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority) properties a greater likelihood of upward economic mobility,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Support for public housing residents</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority manages about 4,000 units around the city and owns some undeveloped land parcels as well. This summer it </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/richmond-redevelopment-and-housing-authority-will-open-up-specific-waitlists-at-the-end-of-june/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened up waitlists,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which can expand housing access for people who need it most, but earlier this year had </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-public-housing-authority-pausing-evictions-april-19-2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed eviction proceedings that it later paused as it reviewed its rent calculations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison noted how the council was able to bolster the Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority’s ongoing work on the Creighton Court transformation, but said that the city will need to “think more outside of the box” on additional funding for RRHA’s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said Richmond could explore a local add-on to the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, a federal resource that some Virginia localities have access to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We just need the political will to go to bat for residents in public housing,” Addison said. “It doesn&#8217;t just take new revenue streams, it takes political courage.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Accountability for landlords on maintenance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosby plans to “go after” landlords who let their properties deteriorate. To address this, she said that “ we will focus on enforcement and proactive partnerships with landlords, tenants, the fire department, and code enforcement to ensure buildings are maintained and safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her administration will also ensure that code enforcement officers are able to monitor properties to take action when violations are visible.  </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boosting nonprofit organizations and supporting public-private partnerships</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city has already been working with local organizations, like Continuum of Care — a local network of homelessness resource groups that receive federal funding — or Habitat for Humanity, for example. Continuing collaborations and building partnerships will be important, candidates said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By working with groups like Virginia Supportive Housing, we can offer not just a place to live but also job training, healthcare, and other critical services to address the root causes of homelessness,” said  Neblett, an entrepreneur and first-time candidate for elected office. “We can’t forget the recovery community in this, people working to rebuild their lives deserve every opportunity to have stable housing as they recover.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other candidates  also mentioned ways the city can bolster efforts of nonprofit organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison noted how Project:HOME purchased a mobile home park in Chesterfield County to preserve it for residents. He’d like to support the organization in efforts to preserve affordable neighborhoods and construct new home types. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roday stressed how public-private partnerships can help yield more home construction and that projects should be available at or below 50% of Richmond’s area median income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can invest more in affordable housing with public-private partnerships that include flexible capital, including municipal dollars,” Roday said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Local requests to the state legislature</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, there are many instances where local government needs permission from the state government to take certain actions, and more broadly,  state laws related to housing can make a significant impact on certain localities. Ahead of the 2025 legislative session, Richmond’s mayoral candidates already have ideas on what to press the legislature for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison said that he supports a proposal that failed this previous legislative session. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed “5,000 Families,” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the bipartisan effort from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield and Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield would help families that experience a housing crisis during a school year remain in place through funding vouchers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also has his eye on a bill by Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, that the legislature plans to address next year that would set a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB721" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cap on how much landlords can increase rent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosby plans to advocate for state-level assistance on solutions to sheltering localities’ unhoused populations and for more funding that localities can use towards affordable housing development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roday and Avula both said they would push for more funding to Virginia’s K-12 education system and reshaping Richmond’s combined sewage overflow system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both of these would add dollars to our budget from the state level,” Roday said. “Then more local dollars could be freed up to invest in housing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neblett said he’ll push for enhancements to Virgnina’s tenant protections and for more funding in the Virginia Housing Trust Fund. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods\Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, the city of Richmond presented a $3 million check to its residents to spend how they want — both metaphorically and literally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crowd of about 50 gathered in Abner Clay Park in the afternoon for the formal kickoff of a public-input process on how to spend the earmarked amount on improvement projects in neighborhoods around the city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What it does is allow you to bring together your community, your neighbors, your friends, (and) your coworkers to identify things you want to see improved right here where you live, work and play,” 1st District councilor Andreas Addison said. “(City councilors) make decisions every year about how we spend the whole budget — let’s put some money in your hands.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39981" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=39981" rel="attachment wp-att-39981"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-39981" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240910_134437-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240910_134437-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240910_134437-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240910_134437-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240910_134437-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240910_134437-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A symbolic check from the city of Richmond to residents at the launch of its Richmond People&#8217;s Budget on Sep. 10, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods\Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addison first led the charge on council to pass an </span><a href="https://richmondva.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4734598&amp;GUID=5C1B5D7E-0255-4EFE-877C-A958602CB8BB&amp;Options=ID%7CText%7C&amp;Search=participatory+budgeting" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordinance </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to create Richmond’s participatory budget process, called the Richmond People’s Budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to learn from residents what they would most like to see the city fix or construct. Between pop up events and an online portal at </span><a href="http://www.rvapb.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.rvapb.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, residents around Richmond can submit their ideas until November. There are already a range of proposals: sidewalk and road improvements like pothole filling; installing speed bumps to calm traffic; building bus shelters and park gazebos; and creating community fridges or community gardens. Some of these suggestions come from residents of the city’s 9th district, which, since the People&#8217;s Budget soft-launched earlier this summer, has submitted the most ideas of all the districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">9th District Councilor Nicole Jones was excited at Tuesday’s formal launch and shared the news of her district’s input. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We gotta keep this energy going though,” she said. “We&#8217;ve got to keep it going. So continue to submit forms. So come out to one of the in-person locations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By March 2025, residents will  be able to vote online and at pop up events on district-specific and city-wide ballots. The next phase of the process should begin by July 2025, as winning proposals become eligible for funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Slaats, a city official helping to oversee the process, considers this first year as fielding and finalizing the projects before seeing efforts on their implementation next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the $3 million allocated, each district will get $200,000 towards projects with the remaining funding to be a supplemental amount for districts that have historically been underinvested in — such as Richmond’s 8th, 9th, 6th, 7th and 3rd districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaats said there will be further conversations among the commission from there to ensure money is going deeper into the portions of those districts that need it most. He pointed to Richmond’s 6th district for example, as it includes some of Richmond’s high-earning households along with some of its lowest-income households.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Jones’ district, the 9th, she said that some of her constituents&#8217; submissions so far have included creating a “Welcome to the South Side” sign. Several districts south of the James River have been historically Black and </span><a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/map/VA/Richmond/area_descriptions/D11.5#loc=12/37.549/-77.541" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">subject to redlining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and underinvestment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When mapping Richmond in the 1930s for part of a Depression-era program to revive the nation’s housing market, <a href="https://homeofva.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/RIR_Booklet_HUD_10_26_18_Web.pdf" target="_blank">appraisers lined Black-populated neighborhoods in red</a> and labeled them “hazardous” for home loans. The effects linger today, as many of these areas have had less public infrastructure and investment. Allocating more of the People’s Budget to parts of these districts is a chance to infuse equity into modern-day capital improvement projects, several speakers at Tuesday’s launch noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Richmond People’s Budget is a first-of-its-kind in Virginia, it’s a process that originated in Brazil and has been adopted by thousands of local governments, school boards and other entities since the late 1980s. Charlottesville city council considered implementing the process a few years ago before reversing course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Closer to Virginia, Slaats said cities like Durham and Greensboro in North Carolina have implemented participatory budget processes several years in a row, with projects ranging from improvements to public parks and recreational centers to </span><a href="https://www.cbs17.com/news/local-news/durham-county-news/durham-housing-authority-communities-to-get-safety-upgrades-with-100000-from-participatory-budgeting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">safety enhancements at public housing complexes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://indyweek.com/news/participatory-budgeting-brings-power-to-the-people/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding social programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Richmond’s pilot is focused on capital improvement projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slaats said to think of it as “we’re not funding an after-school swimming program, but we are fixing the pool.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Addison noted the potential for the concept to grow. Slaats said that he and the committee have been in talks with members of Virginia’s General Assembly and other localities in Virginia with the hopes to see it “spread around Virginia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott’s endorsement joins a growing list of over 100 current or former state, local or federal officials to back Spanberger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott, a lawyer and former U.S Navy officer, made history as the first Black Speaker elected in the 400-year history of Virginia’s General Assembly. Spanberger is a former Central Intelligence Agency case officer who was first elected to represent Virginia’s 7th Congressional District in 2018, the first woman to do so. Now, Scott hopes to see her become Virginia’s first woman governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He recalled “getting to know [Spanberger] over the last few years” and their mutual support for each others’ efforts to connect with constituents and other elected officials across party lines around the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think her number one quality is that she listens,” Scott said in a phone call Monday afternoon. “She has made an effort to serve every corner of our community and our Commonwealth.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Spanberger noted Scott’s efforts to engage with people around the state too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Speaker Scott is dedicated to uplifting his fellow Virginians — and his ability to work with both parties shows his commitment to getting things done for the Commonwealth,” she said in a statement.”I am truly grateful for his endorsement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both will be up for election next year, and should Democrats retain their control of the House of Delegates, Scott could continue in his role as Speaker.</span></p>

Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, addresses his colleagues in the House of Delegates after being elected speaker of the House at the Virginia State Capitol on Jan. 10. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s bipartisan efforts to bring infrastructure and broadband funding to the state and her support of congress’ Inflation Reduction Act earned Scott’s backing, he said. He noted their shared goals of increasing investments in public education and Spanberger’s support for three constitutional amendments that Virginia Democrats plan to kick start next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2025, Democrats plan to advance</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-abortion-rights-restoration-same-sex-marriage/article_731f82a4-b4b0-11ee-9c14-7719906ce1fc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposed amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Virginia’s constitution that will cement abortion protections, remove a same-sex marriage prohibition from the constitution, and enshrine the automatic restoration of voting rights for formerly incarcerated people who have served their prison time. The measures will need to pass two years in a row with a House of Delegates election in between before appearing on statewide ballots for voters to approve or reject, meaning they are not subject to gubernatorial approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that doesn’t mean Spanberger’s support won’t be important for their potential success, should she ascend to the governor’s chair, Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to win together [next November],” he said.”That’s because we&#8217;re going to continue to move Virginia forward and not take us backwards.” </span></p>

Tim Walz’s commitment to reproductive rights policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tour will tout campaign promises to voters, such as Harris’ plan to sign into law a bill to restore federal abortion protections, should congress send one to her desk if she becomes president, while Walz will stand ready to cast a tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate if need be. With stops planned in Richmond, Virginia Beach and Northern Virginia, the tour’s foray across the commonwealth comes as early voting begins in Virginia next week and less than two months until Election Day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year while President Joe Biden was still seeking re-election, he and Harris had kicked off their campaign in Virginia on the platform to “restore Roe.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new bus tour will stop in all 50 states, including its three Virginia pit stops. A spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign in Virginia said that more details on the time and exact locations will be announced soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stops in Virginia will feature rallies led by elected leaders to include Virginia congresswomen Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond and Abigail Spanberger, D-Henrico. House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark will join them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Featured speakers include Amanda Zurawski, who is </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/31/texas-supreme-court-zurawski-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">part of a lawsuit against the state of Texas for being denied an abortion amid her pregnancy complications,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Louisiana resident </span><a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/08/19/kaitlyn-joshua/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaitlyn Joshua who  shared the story of being denied care for a miscarriage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Democratic National Convention last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tour plans to highlight the differences between the Harris-Walz campaign and that of former President Donald Trump and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio. The substantially-shifted national landscape surrounding abortion access has changed in recent years following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which had protected abortion federally for decades. Trump’s appointees to the court had upheld Roe as federal law during their confirmation hearings before ultimately ruling to undo it. As states now set their own laws on access or restrictions — something Trump has touted and claimed credit for —  Democrats point to growing uncertainty around access to birth control or family planning measures like in vitro fertilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several states have since voted to enshrine abortion protections into their constitutions — a process Virginia Democrats</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-abortion-rights-restoration-same-sex-marriage/article_731f82a4-b4b0-11ee-9c14-7719906ce1fc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hope to kickstart next year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — or drafted laws to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-contraception-virginia-general-assembly-hashmi-price/article_c74b197a-fb59-11ee-92c1-1b2a173616ec.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">protect other reproductive rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congressional Democratic campaigns along with the Harris-Walz campaign also point to outlines in a Heritage Foundation guidebook called Project 2025 that entails </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/mcclellan-spanberger-work-to-repeal-parts-of-19th-century-law-that-could-ban-abortion-nationally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employing a long-dormant federal law to further restrict abortion medication and mailing of abortifacients.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Critics and reproductive rights advocates have said this could pave the way for a national ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we crisscross the country, we are driving that contrast home to red and blue voters and independents,” Harris-Walz campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. “The [tour] will drive home for voters that this threat to our fundamental freedoms touches every American.” </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A years-long legal battle has entered a new chapter as residents of Brown Grove, a </span><a href="https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/042-5802/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black neighborhood in Hanover County, and a neighboring subdivision, have filed their response as part of the appeal in their case against the county’s board of supervisors and Wegmans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the national grocery chain was granted approval by the county’s board four years ago to build a large distribution center, it’s been beset by legal challenges ever since. The residents’ initial lawsuit was dismissed by Hanover Circuit Court; it has now landed in the Court of Appeals of Virginia. This is because last year, the Supreme Court of Virginia reversed the circuit court’s decision and deemed the residents had the right to challenge the supervisors’ decision.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xaMFx3hOaR"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/12/supreme-court-of-virginia-says-it-wont-reconsider-wegmans-decision/">Supreme Court of Virginia says it won’t reconsider Wegmans decision</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Supreme Court of Virginia says it won’t reconsider Wegmans decision&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/12/supreme-court-of-virginia-says-it-wont-reconsider-wegmans-decision/embed/#?secret=NlHaUQUZQv#?secret=xaMFx3hOaR" data-secret="xaMFx3hOaR" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their suit, a group of local residents ask the court to declare the permissions for the project void based on claims that county officials violated state and local laws when granting Wegmans a special permit and an exception to local zoning ordinances that allowed the development of a 1.1 million square foot distribution center to proceed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though advance notice was published in a local newspaper ahead of the planned vote, the residents’ indicate that there was no specification about a cap on public comment registrations and restrictions on how many people could have physical access to the board room to observe the proceedings. They also challenge that the Wegman’s project was not an “essential” government function — as outlined in a local ordinance established for continuity of governance during that early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, by the time the limited public hearing took place, new proffers related to the project  were put up for discussion, rather than the documents that some residents had been able to provide virtual commentary on beforehand, the suit states. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title15.2/chapter22/article7/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law outlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how zoning changes — which is what an earlier part of the project needed to continue —  must give adjoining property owners written notice of the request for modification, and an opportunity to respond to the request within 21 days of the date of the notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It wasn’t ‘in the dark of night’ with it happening at around 2:00 p.m., but it was effectively in the dark of night,” said Rod Morgan, a plaintiff in the case. “When you combine proffers submitted illegally with lack of access for the public, that’s a real issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as Morgan and his neighbors have filed a brief, other groups have filed an amicus brief in response to the case as well. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Chamber of Commerce, Virginia Economic Developers Association, Associated General Contractors of Virginia and others jointly filed a brief defending Wegman’s and Hanover’s board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That brief said that Wegman’s proffer was submitted before the 21-day deadline, but that the company continued to work with local government on refinements that led to the new proffer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As is customary with these types of applications, Wegmans continued to work with the Board, County officials, and the public to address their comments and further revise </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the proffers,” the brief read. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also notes another part of state code regarding zoning changes that allow for amended proffers to be accepted once a public hearing has already begun should the amendments “not materially affect the overall proposal.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In defense of the county and Wegmans, the brief also said that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if the court doesn’t side with Hanover County’s board, it “will create disastrous results for localities throughout the Commonwealth and significantly impede economic development in Virginia.”</span></p>
<p>Wegmans and the Hanover County Board of Supervisors did not respond to request for comment on this article.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">History and the present</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than a local land use dispute, the placement of the development and pushback it garnered recalls the industrial encroachment or diminishment of historically Black neighborhoods in previous years, when Black people were disenfranchised in society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other examples exist in Virginia, such as how</span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/charlottesville-officially-apologizes-for-razing-vinegar-hill/article_83b8aed4-2f4a-5ee2-baaa-2e7c9d43c2b0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Charlottesville’s city council voted to raze Vinegar Hill in the 1960s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or how </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-03-07/reconnect-jackson-ward-interstate-95-cap-grant" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I-95 cut through Richmond’s Jackson Ward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a “</span><a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/jackson-ward-and-its-black-wall-street.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Wall Street</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” in the south. I-95 also halved Brown Grove around that time as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the once-contiguous community is sprinkled with a municipal airport, an industrial park, a landfill, concrete plants, and an I-95 truck stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown Grove first took shape from formerly enslaved people following the Civil War — just miles away from Richmond, Virginia’s state capital and the former capital of the Confederacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash forward to present day, and Brown Grove native Renada Harris lives near several of her family members as land has passed from generation to generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s what makes our community unique,” she said. “You don’t see a lot of communities (of color) like this still intact.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that communities that have historically been oppressed “are seen as not as likely to fight.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and others founded the Brown Grove Preservation Group a few years ago. Through learning more about local and state laws, she said, neighbors were more equipped to advocate for themselves. The group also had support from the NAACP, Virginia’s chapter of the Sierra Club, and the Virginia Poverty Law Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to organizing efforts, Harris said there had been a defeatist attitude among some of her neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They said ‘Those white people in Hanover are going to do what they want to do anywhere,’” Harris said both her Black and white neighbors would communicate.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as the mostly-white neighbors in the subdivision nearby Brow Grove began to be frustrated with Hanover County’s handling of the Wegmans development, deeper neighborhood alliances were formed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Harris is not one of the plaintiffs, she said the lawsuit is important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad it’s out of Hanover County’s hands at this point,” she said. “Because I don’t think it would get a fair trial.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Buniva, the residents’ attorney who somewhat came out of retirement for this case four years ago, didn’t think at 73 years old, he’d still be defending it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In all these years my clients have not been able to be heard in court on merits, it’s all been through demurrers and motions to dismiss and delays and so on,” he said. “Well, we’re not going away.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only state in the South that hasn’t restricted abortion access since the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade in 2022, which made abortion a federal right, Virginia is a key player in the country’s reproductive health landscape. By dismantling Roe v Wade, the nation’s highest court laid the groundwork for each state to restrict or enhance access to abortion; a spate of state bans on abortion have since emerged, with 14 states making the procedure illegal. Abortion remains legal in Virginia and state Democrats will push to enshrine it as a right in the commonwealth’s constitution next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republican candidates in Virginia’s congressional races assert that abortion access should be determined at the state level. In District 2, Republican incumbent U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, a Navy veteran, nurse and former member of the state senate, has “consistently advocated for women to choose life, but respects exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother,” according to her campaign </span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who is also a Navy veteran as well as the director of a nonprofit focused on women veterans, </span><a href="https://fb.watch/uhpo6DTiSN/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared herself</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “the only pro-choice Navy veteran in this race.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, anchored in Prince William County but also spanning rural parts of the state, Spotsylvania attorney and former Green Beret Derrick Anderson, a Republican, is challenging career military officer and Democrat Eugene Vindman for the seat currently occupied by Abigail Spanberger, who is running for governor next year. Anderson has expressed support for the overturn of Roe and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DerrickAndersonforVA/videos/my-life-story-is-pro-life-and-thats-how-i-will-serve-in-congress-my-mother-got-p/414067620643367/?locale=ms_MY" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life” while sharing on social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his mother had him as a single parent at 17 years old. Vindman plans to support </span><a href="https://vindmanforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to abortions and contraception along with in vitro fertilization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, anchored in Loudoun County, Democratic state Sen. Suhas Subramanyam is running against Republican Mike Clancy to fill Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s seat. Wexton will not seek reelection due to a health issue, and endorsed Subramanyam during his democratic primary. He has supported an effort to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enshrine abortion protections into Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plans to support federal protections. Clancy said that he “does not support federal action on abortion.” His campaign website lists “respect life” as a campaign issue and notes his support for resources for pregnant people and families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, incumbent Rep. Morgan Griffith faces Democratic challenger Karen Baker, a lawyer-turned-nurse. Griffith has voted against congressional efforts to protect abortion access and </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402684" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Roe v. Wade had “produced decades of tragedy.” Baker wrote on her campaign website that “women’s choices must be respected.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ksn63EC7JL"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/">They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;They don’t like abortion, but Kaine’s GOP challengers say they won’t seek a federal ban&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/embed/#?secret=H3VtqeFCdu#?secret=Ksn63EC7JL" data-secret="Ksn63EC7JL" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, who is seeking reelection, has co-sponsored the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/kaine-others-reintroduce-reproductive-freedom-for-all-act/article_f6cbd514-a8a7-11ed-8ac8-e388ae499856.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive Freedom For All Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would protect access federally, now that Roe has been overturned. His Republican challenger, retired Navy veteran Hung Cao, told Virginia Mercury this summer that he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t support a federal abortion ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has also </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/right-to-life/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called himself “pro-life.” </span></a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is an issue people experience practically and constantly, amid paying rent or mortgages. Local governments handle approvals or rejections of developments and craft zoning laws that guide development potential. But state and federal lawmakers have roles to play as well — largely through funding mechanisms or taking action where housing intersects with other policy platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many congressional candidates this year don’t have housing policy outlined on their websites, some have been talking about how they plan to help states and local governments from the federal level. The Mercury reached out to others for more details on what they would do to help with housing supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 2, Incumbent Rep. Jen Kiggans did not respond to inquiry for more details on housing policy by the time of this publication, though during her time in the state legislature as a senator, she voted in favor of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0271HB1889+HB1889" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her challenger, Democrat Missy Cotter Smasal, acknowledged the Mercury’s request for comment but did not follow through with a response in time for this publication. Her website touches on housing policy while addressing the economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to stop the price gouging on groceries, and stop massive corporations from buying up houses and raising rent,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Democratic candidate Eugene Vindman expressed support for building more homes that middle-class families can purchase and “support programs that help first-time homebuyers buy a house.” He added that he’s concerned about out-of-state corporations buying homes that they then sell or rent at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Congress, I will work to take on these speculators who are putting regular people&#8217;s American dream out of reach,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican candidate Derrick Anderson said he’s going to focus initially on how Congress can help reduce inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing I’d do is pass a federal balanced budget amendment – ridiculous inflationary spending drove up housing prices (and grocery costs, gas costs, etc),” he said in an email. “Let’s stop the spending and get inflation down for the sake of Virginians who are struggling to get by.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 10, Republican Mike Clancy could not be reached for comment by the time of this publication. His campaign website doesn’t include housing policy, but it does stress his goal of helping to reduce inflation and stimulate the economy by “unleashing American innovation” and energy as well as reducing regulations on small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Suhas Subramanyam’s campaign replied to The Mercury’s inquiry but did not follow through with his housing policy plans should he become a congressman before publication. He has supported affordability measures as a state senator: This year he </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">co-sponsored a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to allow more Virginian localities to utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits when approving developments, but it was vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Democratic challenger Karen Baker supports expansion of tax credits that can help spur construction of affordable housing available to various levels of area median income. She also wants to</span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/affordable-housing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “work on tailored solutions that address the specific needs of rural communities,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like the Southwest Virginia ones she seeks to represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his tenure as representative, Morgan Griffith has </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=402287" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appropriations to his district meant to help with affordable housing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has cited his early-career experience as a fair housing lawyer before he went into politics. As a member of congress, he pointed to a bill he co-sponsored, the </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/klobuchar-kaine-introduce-legislation-to-address-nationwide-housing-shortage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing Supply and Affordability Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would create a grant program for state and local governments to tap into. He’s also been involved with the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-Income First-Time Homebuyers Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would establish fixed-rate 20 year mortgages for first-time buyers whose income doesn’t exceed a certain amount. Both bills have been introduced multiple times but have yet to become law. Kaine also supports expansions to Low Income Housing Tax Credits, which helps increase affordable housing supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s opponent, Hung Cao, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">echoes a stance of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that ties housing issues to the U.S.-Mexico border</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First and foremost, we need to secure the border,” Cao said in an email to The Mercury. “Everything that’s going wrong in our country right now is a direct result of our wide-open southern border. Housing costs are at an all-time high because there&#8217;s millions who were not here a few years ago for which we need to provide housing.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress remains at a standstill as lawmakers fiercely debate the future of gun rights in America, with proponents of stricter gun control measures clashing with staunch defenders of the Second Amendment. Amid a surge in mass shootings and growing public outcry, both sides are digging in, setting the stage for what will likely be another defining battle over gun laws as the nation is headed toward the 2024 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who was governor of Virginia when the deadly mass shooting at Virginia Tech took place in 2007, co-sponsored the Virginia Plan to Reduce Gun Violence, which he said would enact the same gun safety provisions passed by the Democratic-controlled Virginia General Assembly in 2020 at the federal level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hung Cao, Kaine’s Republican opponent, strictly opposes further legislation that he believes would infringe Second Amendment rights. Instead, Cao proposes that gun-related violence to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Prosecutors who refuse to enforce the law must be held accountable, the retired U.S. Navy captain said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, in 2023 received a 100% rating by Gun Owners of America (GOA), a national gun rights organization, and a 92% rating by the National Rifle Association (NRA) in the previous year. While in the Virginia legislature, Kiggans has voted against universal background checks, expanding red flag laws that take guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and those who pose a threat to Virginians, and against prohibiting guns in schools and childcare centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Missy Cotter Smasal, Kiggans’ Democratic opponent, states on her campaign website that she is committed to legislation seeking to prevent gun violence, create safer communities, and prevent veteran suicide. Smasal said that there are “commonsense measures supported by large majorities of Virginians” that can make Virginia’s neighborhoods safer while also protecting individual rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 7, Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee, has stated that Second Amendment rights are sacred and shall not be infringed upon. As a former special forces Green Beret, Anderson vows to be “a strong advocate for gun owners in the halls of Congress.” Earlier this year, the Republican turned to the social media platform X, where </span><a href="https://x.com/DerrickforVA/status/1774127722647687559" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Americans have to “stand up for and protect our 2nd Amendment rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a former career military officer and the Democratic nominee, supports gun safety measures such as background checks and red flag laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, the mentally ill, and others who might cause harm. While he believes in the right of law-abiding gun owners to own firearms, Vindman also pushes for more legislation ensuring public safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, is a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights. Griffith said in a statement to The Mercury that he does not support government-mandated registrations of guns but that he backs harsher penalties for offenders who “abuse the right to have guns” by committing felonious crimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent and a gun owner, said she backs rigorous gun safety training for children in school. She is also pushing for enhanced gun safety laws, including tax credits for trigger locks, and she has called for enhanced mental health services for troubled individuals, and a legal mechanism to manage early reports of suspicious behaviors involving non-imminent ideation of shootings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the state in District 10, constitutional lawyer Mike Clancy, the Republican nominee, has vowed to defend Americans’ constitutional rights without exception, including the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Instead of regulating gun ownership. Clancy is pushing for legislation to fully fund law enforcement to ensure law enforcement has the training and equipment to protect Virginia’s communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Virginia’s state legislature, Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent, has actively supported several gun safety laws, including </span><a href="https://www.suhasforvirginia.com/press-and-media/key-gun-violence-prevention-bills-from-senator-subramanyam-vetoed-by-gun-lobby-backed-governor" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several measures which passed the General Assembly just this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two of which were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Suhas told The Mercury he believes America can achieve serious progress on this issue while respecting the Second Amendment, and without undermining the rights of responsible gun owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education/Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With divergent calls from some to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education and from others to improve teacher pay, public education is a top matter for voters in Virginia and across the nation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in April, half of the Americans surveyed said that public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction. Some believe that schools should spend more time on core academic subjects. At the same time, communities, including those in Virginia, are sparring over what is taught in schools, particularly history, and gauging if students are falling behind in their studies and how to address that challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools are also facing confrontation from parents over social issues, such as the types of books that are allowed in schools and the treatment of transgender students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these education issues and recommendations to address them are outlined in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/04/what-could-project-2025-mean-for-education-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project 2025</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a conservative plan for how the country should operate if a Republican wins the White House. Some support the plan and others fear it could derail previous efforts to improve public education in Virginia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the state’s District 2 congressional race, Republican nominee and incumbent Jen Kiggans has publicly supported</span><a href="https://jenforcongress.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prioritizing students&#8217; safety and security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and equipping teachers with tools and resources to improve student outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She voted for the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parents Bills of Rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a measure to “ensure the rights of parents are honored in public schools” and stands against critical race theory, a graduate-level framework that focuses on racial inequity and has not been found in Virginia curricula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the authors of Project 2025 and Kiggans, the Republican nominee for the District 10 seat Mike Clancy said he supports school choice. </span></p>
<p>Democratic nominee Eugene Vindman, in District 7, said he opposes book bans and the project, which he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/opinion/column/eugene-vindman-project-2025-is-a-threat-to-democracy/article_709f3f3a-6a2a-11ef-927e-b310eb440bd5.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">sa</a>id his opponent and Republican nominee Derrick Anderson has failed to denounce.</p>
<p>Anderson said Vindman is “lying” and denied supporting the project&#8217;s proposal to eliminate the U.S. Department of <span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Education</span>.</p>
<p>He said he supports helping students in his home district “succeed” and will advocate for ensuring that “test scores go up and conflicts go down.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In District 9, Karen Baker, the democratic nominee, said she supports strengthening public schools, much like Vindman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Baker’s </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she supports making universal preschool “a reality for all families” in Southwest Virginia. She also supports investing in vocational education and making it accessible to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said if elected, he will work to expand Pre-K, access to “critical“ job training into apprentice programs, and support providing resources to local schools to close the pandemic, learning loss gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He told the Mercury that if the recommendations for Project 2025 were implemented, it would “devastate” Virginia’s public education system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We must do the opposite: invest in our schools, support our parents and teachers, and make college and postgraduate education affordable,” Subramanyam’s campaign said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Environment/Climate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates in Virginia’s congressional races largely have expressed the desire to address climate change by transitioning to zero-carbon generation sources. Some candidates differentiate themselves, like District 3 incumbent U.S. Rep. Bobby </span><a href="https://www.bobbyscottforcongress.com/the-scott-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who’s advocated for funding Norfolk’s flood wall to reduce sea level rise damage. District 6 contender Ken </span><a href="https://www.kenmitchellforvirginia.com/issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighted a need to “transition public investments away from propping up fossil fuel companies” on his campaign site, while District 11 incumbent U.S. Rep. Gerry </span><a href="https://gerryconnolly.com/issues/environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connolly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said he’s an advocate for environmental justice, an environmental lens that amplifies the voices and needs of overlooked and overburdened communities during development that could impact their area. District 9 candidate Karen </span><a href="https://www.bakerforva9th.com/coal-miners" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baker </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t address climate change on her website, but highlights a need to protect coal miners’ health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the aisle, Republican congressional candidates also mostly fall in line with each other’s environmental policy views by advocating for  </span><a href="https://www.mikeclancyforcongress.com/services-5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reducing regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.hungforva.com/enviornment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy independence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or promoting energy sources stemming from </span><a href="https://cline.house.gov/issues/energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://sitkaforcongress.com/on-the-issues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nuclear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some candidates don’t take clear positions about their environmental policy plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking unique approaches on the GOP side are District 2 incumbent U.S. Rep Jen Kiggans, who signed onto a letter with other House Republicans earlier this year asking for House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/some-house-republicans-warn-against-climate-law-repeal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax credits of the IRA, which have helped incentivize a burgeoning offshore wind </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/07/09/south-korean-company-plans-to-build-681-million-offshore-wind-submarine-cable-plant-in-chesapeake/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry in the Hampton Roads region. U.S. Rep.

District 7 candidate Derrick Anderson doesn’t offer a clear position on his website.</span></p>

Some environmental groups say the bill includes some concessions for continued natural gas use. Whichever party gains majority control of Congress could determine the fate of that bill.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns over election integrity and the potential for voter fraud have sparked a renewed focus in Congress, as lawmakers from both parties debate how best to safeguard the democratic process. With allegations of fraudulent voting making headlines in recent election cycles, the issue has become a political flashpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some legislators call for stricter voting regulations to prevent potential abuse, others argue that such measures could suppress voter participation. As the 2024 election approaches, members of Congress are crafting new policies aimed at ensuring fair elections while addressing public concerns over security and accessibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the U.S. Senate, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., has carried legislation such as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would implement provisions like automatic voter registration, same-day and Election Day voter registration, online voter registration, and no-excuse mail voting. Kaine has also co-sponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which seeks to restore and update crucial protections against voting discrimination that were weakened by recent Supreme Court decisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent Hung Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain who is backed by former President Donald Trump, has proposed few legislative means to secure the electoral process beyond a universal requirement for providing a voter ID in order to cast a ballot. But he said in a statement to The Mercury that “the only way to have election integrity is to have people watch the polls.” Cao has also suggested that the U.S. hold elections like the ones he witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan, where people vote with their finger and blue ink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, who represents House District 2, voted in support of the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/bills/hr8281/BILLS-118hr8281rh.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which passed in the House of Representatives by a 221-198 vote. Advocates of the SAVE Act say it would ensure that only citizens can vote in federal elections, partly by making it mandatory for states to obtain proof of citizenship to register voters and also requiring states to purge noncitizens from voter rolls. But President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the measure, stating that it would make it more difficult for eligible voters to register and increase “the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal, who previously mounted an unsuccessful campaign in Virginia’s 8th Senate District, has talked little about election integrity legislation. But the U.S. Navy veteran has attacked her Republican opponent for being  a “big supporter of President Trump” for backing “Big Lie” conspiracy theorists in Virginia’s state legislature by being one of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/24/virginia-youngkin-tax-cuts-house-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only four Senators to vote for an audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the 2020 election that would have cost Virginia taxpayers $70 million.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">former special forces Green Beret and the Republican nominee in District 7, has talked little publically about election integrity and he offers no clues about his views on his campaign website, but in </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with The Daily Progress he acknowledged that Joe Biden is the legitimate president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If elected, Anderson’s Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, the twin brother of anti-Trump whistleblower Alexander Vindman, has vowed to work to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and strengthen protections for election workers, “so that anyone who threatens a poll volunteer or election official in an attempt to undermine our vote is held accountable.” Vindman, whose family emigrated to the United States from the former Soviet Union, has also warned against downplaying the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, which he blamed on a pro-Trump movement that did not recognize the nation’s norms of peaceful transfer of power and that he said undermines elections across the country to this day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, the incumbent in District 9, in 2023 sponsored the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4460" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Vote for Non-Citizens Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, seeking to ensure only eligible American citizens may participate in federal elections. The bill, which is still moving through the House, withholds some federal dollars that go to localities that allow non-citizens to vote in their elections. Griffith also voted for the SAVE Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrat Karen Baker, Griffith’s opponent, told The Mercury that Republicans have failed to provide any evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and therefore there is no reason to believe that this year’s election will be different. Baker also stated that fears of undocumented immigrants voting are generated to induce distrust of election integrity but are absolutely without basis, and she has criticized Griffith for refusing to state that he will accept the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Mike Clancy, an attorney from Loudoun County and the Republican nominee in District 10, does not list election integrity as one of his legislative priorities on his campaign website, he has been outspoken on social media about strengthening election laws. “Congress must pass the SAVE Act,” Clancy </span><a href="https://x.com/MikeClancyVA/status/1811031488923586986" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July. “Only U.S. citizens should be voting in our elections.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, Clancy’s opponent and a strict opponent of the SAVE Act, believes that “democracy is under attack” in America. The son of Indian immigrants, Subramanyam has vowed to continue to fight against “restrictive voter ID laws that are designed to suppress the vote, protect early voting to ensure greater access to the polls, and combat political gerrymandering.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Americans find that more migrants are turning to the United States for employment opportunities or to escape violent conflict in their home countries, among other reasons, they are increasingly interested in candidates&#8217; views on immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America has become one of the most prominent destinations for migrants. However, over several years, many migrants have entered the country illegally, prompting backlash. At the same time, migrants have also been a staple of America’s workforce, including in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://map.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/locations/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Immigration Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, immigrants comprised about 12.6% of Virginia’s total population in 2022, and 16.2% of Virginia&#8217;s labor force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 9 race, Republican nominee and incumbent Morgan Griffith said immigrants are welcome to come to the United States “legally” and share in the “American dream,&#8221; but supports “cracking down” on illegal immigration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While criticizing the House for ducking its responsibility, Democratic nominee Karen Baker in District 9 said Congress needs to pass comprehensive immigration reform. She said she supports the Senate&#8217;s template for more border control agents and asylum officers and advocates for a DACA bill to protect children who have lived in the U.S. their entire lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the District 2 race, Jen Kiggans’ campaign said the Republican nominee and incumbent voted for legislation to increase security at the U.S. border by ensuring that federal immigration officials have the training and resources to stop the influx of illegal immigration, drugs and crime into the U.S. The measure has remained in the Senate since last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans supports strict enforcement of existing federal immigration laws and holding President Joe Biden’s administration accountable. She also backed legislation to prevent the administration from using National Parks to house illegal immigrants.</span></p>
<p>Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee for the District 7 seat, said he <a class="c-link" href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/elections/derrick-anderson-talks-biden-the-border-and-inflation-ahead-of-tuesdays-gop-primary/article_a009bd2a-2837-11ef-9cbd-0f478e969dbd.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">supports</a> shutting down the border.</p>
<p>“It’s clear that the crisis at the border is hurting people right here in Virginia’s 7th District,” Anderson said in a statement. “Drugs, fentanyl, human trafficking – we need a serious change. We need to secure the border.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said with the U.S. immigration system being “broken,” he supports the country taking a comprehensive approach to the problem by starting with securing the border and ensuring that people who are doing “the right things the right way and contributing to our economy“ have a path to citizenship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the country must also fix its “broken” asylum system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Foreign policy (Israel-Hamas conflict, China, Ukraine)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia voters are following their congressional candidates&#8217; views on common issues in the U.S., they are also considering their responses to global conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Pew Research Center </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/04/23/what-are-americans-top-foreign-policy-priorities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was completed in April, two of the most important issues to Americans are limiting the powers of China and finding a solution to the Israel-Hamas conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are also interested in limiting Russia’s powers following its invasion of Ukraine in Feb. 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he takes pride in the fact that he is among a wide slate of lawmakers President Vladimir Putin of Russia permanently banned from visiting Russia in response to his record of standing against Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Kaine has voted for aid to Ukraine, and earlier this year he helped pass a supplemental package that included support for the country to defend its sovereignty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also said he views the U.S.-China relationship as the most consequential bilateral relationship of the century. Kaine voted to pass the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHIPS and Science Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to outcompete China by shoring up domestic supply chains and bringing manufacturing back to America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli territories on Oct. 7, 2023, Kaine has worked with Democrats, Republicans, and the Biden administration to ensure that Israel has defensive support. But Kaine has also called for a reduction of civilian casualties, supported the safe and swift delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, and for long-term solutions to allow Palestinians and Israelis to live alongside each other in peace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s Republican opponent and former U.S. Navy captain Hung Cao in a statement criticized the Biden administration and Congress for giving “blanket amounts of money” towards Ukraine’s defense effort, alleging the financial support instead helps fund Ukraine’s retired workers pension plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao considers China an “existential threat” to the United States, and he has further called for the continued support of Israel, which he considers one of the United States’ closest allies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jen Kiggans’ campaign, the District 2 Republican nominee and incumbent supports legislation to impose sanctions against China for its responsibility in the fentanyl crisis and </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/22/cosponsors" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevent selling any petroleum to Chinese Communist Party-controlled entities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her campaign also said she prioritizes protecting American jobs and intellectual property from being stolen by the CCP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in District 7 and a former special forces Green Beret with six tours of duty overseas, including Afghanistan, Iraq, and various countries throughout the Middle East, told the </span><a href="https://jewishinsider.com/2024/04/virginia-congressional-candidate-derrick-anderson-military/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jewish Insider”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an interview in April that Congress needs to move quickly to provide additional aid to the Jewish state in its war against Hamas. He added that he was skeptical of sending more U.S. funds to the Palestinians, noting that other countries are providing aid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Anderson, his Democratic opponent Eugene Vindman, also a veteran, called for continued support for Israel, while asking that the U.S. continue to ensure that all the hostages — including Americans — are returned safe and sound to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman has also pushed for the continued support of Ukraine in both military and economic terms, and for taking on China&#8217;s state-directed economic system, which he said unfairly competes in the market and compromises America’s national security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, voted for the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022, which allowed the lending and lease of American defense material to the country in its defense of the Russian invasion, he also also voted to block similar legislation last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffith </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> China a “dangerous, power-hungry actor” over the country’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, as well as its escalating efforts to control Taiwan, while </span><a href="https://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403086" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticizing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden’s decision to hold an arms shipment to Israel last spring. Griffith also said that America’s dealings with other countries must be driven by a careful analysis of what best serves the United States and its citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, Karen Baker, Griffith’s Democratic opponent, has pointed out that while she acknowledged Israel’s right to exist, there are “bad acts on both sides.” Baker has also endorsed the continued financial and military support of Ukraine by the United States, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, the Democratic nominee in District 10, said he supports the U.S. in opposing Russia leader Vladimir Putin&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe and standing up to China, which is “violating international law and illegally dumping goods to prop up their economy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports the CHIPS Act, which helped to boost domestic research and manufacturing of semiconductor chips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Israel-Hamas war, Subramanyam said he supports the U.S. returning hostages, especially  American citizens, and helping to rebuild communities affected by the war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also supports a two-state solution, adding that Hamas cannot be one of the states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The human lives lost in this conflict have been devastating for all sides,” Subramanyam said in a statement. “I have visited the region, including the areas of Israel that were attacked, and made good friends there. I want to see an end to the war and a long-term path to peace.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His visit to support Virginia Democrats and Vice President Kamala Harris came as Axios reported that former President Donald Trump’s campaign is </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/05/trump-campaign-shifts-path-narrows" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scaling back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia and other states he’d been focused on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this summer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Recent polling shows Harris with a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/20/harris-holds-slim-lead-over-trump-in-virginia-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slight lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday afternoon at Ettrick Deli near Virginia State University, McClellan hosted a meet and greet with Pearson to talk about key issues, two months before the general election that will determine the outcome of McClellan’s race against Republican challenger Bill Moher to represent Virginia’s 4th Congressional District. Though the district is reliably Democratic, McClellan said she hopes to gain re-election with higher margins than she did when she first won the seat by a special election in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/mcclellan-beats-benjamin-in-special-election-for-virginia-congressional-seat/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With that win, McClellan became the state’s first Black congresswoman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and Pearson said that driving up interest about Harris’ campaign in Virginia and elsewhere can benefit Democrats up and down the ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan also called Pearson, 29, a “rising star” in her party who she believes may go on to serve in congress someday. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He made national headlines last spring as one of two state lawmakers to be expelled from the state legislature for </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/expulsion-of-tennessee-lawmakers-opens-questions-about-protections/article_ec4aa832-d583-11ed-9a38-0b3da5a287c4.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">participating in a protest from the House floor concerning gun violence. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dubbed the “Tennessee Three” by supporters, he and colleagues Justin Jones and Gloria Johnson were reprimanded for speaking without formally being recognized on the House floor. Johnson, a white woman, was spared from the expulsion while her Black male counterparts were temporarily kicked out of the legislature. Pearson and Jones went on to win </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/04/1192068281/the-2-expelled-members-of-the-tennessee-3-win-back-their-state-house-seats" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reelection </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to their seats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pearson is still hopeful for more gun violence prevention policy to prevail in state legislatures and said that he thinks a federal assault-style weapon ban would be a big step in gun violence prevention. This year, Virginia’s own proposed version of an assault firearm ban cleared the Democratic-controlled legislature before being </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While speaking with Virginia State University students on the deli’s patio, Pearson noted young voters’ role in helping to shape their own future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Folks from the age 18 to 36 are the largest voting bloc in the country,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, of the over 36,000 new voter registrations last month, over 22,000 of the people are</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/registration-statistics/2024/08/pdf/Monthly_New_Registrant_By_Age_Gender_2024_09_01_053637.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">under the age of 35, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Department of Elections data. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research also shows that Democrats have an </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/age-generational-cohorts-and-party-identification/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">edge </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in younger voter demographics while Republicans tend to have an edge with older voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;ve already got the first Black woman congressperson from the state of Virginia (and the) first Black woman vice president of the United States of America,” Pearson said, before suggesting that young Democrats “are going to be the deciders.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While environmental and social issues have been prominent for young voters, Pearson noted that economics and affordable housing are concerns he’s hearing from younger constituents, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re talking about a fight for our future,” he said. “We’re talking about the climate. We’re talking about having enough money to be able to find a home and start a family.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares signed onto a letter</span><a href="https://consumersresearch.org/documents/analysis-are-asset-managers-blindly-following-iss-on-esg/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> citing research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Consumers’ Research, a nonprofit organization, that highlighted large asset managers voting for recommendations by Institutional Shareholder Services on climate-related shareholder proposals. ISS is a proxy advisory firm that investment companies can use for recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attorneys general asked the companies if they consult or rely on recommendations of proxy firms, such as ISS or other third parties, when voting on shareholder proposals relating to environmental issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are concerned that the [the companies] may have outsourced their voting in this area to ISS or another third party and are failing to carry out their fiduciary duties,” the joint letter to 25 of the nation’s top asset managers read.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ inquiry comes after he joined </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/23/va-attorney-general-miyares-challenging-heavy-truck-emissions-rule-and-other-federal-proposals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to other emission reduction policies and joined an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-joins-multistate-investigation-into-major-banks-net-zero-commitments/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into other banks’ net-zero goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Consumers’ Research is critical of ESG investing and has a “</span><a href="https://consumersresearch.org/wokealert/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">woke alert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” feature on its website. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/esg-investing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ESG is an umbrella term </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">used to describe companies’ consideration of environmental, social and governance factors like climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in their business dealings. The ESG investing lens has prompted</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/business-fights-back-republican-state-lawmakers-push-anti-esg-agenda-2023-04-22/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pushback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2335" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawmakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and attorneys general in several states in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter, sent last week and seeking answers from the asset managers by next month, is led by Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen. Miyares is joined by his counterparts in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, and Wyoming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sound economics should take priority over social fads,” Miyares said in a press release announcing he’d joined the letter. “Asset managers have a fiduciary responsibility to be proper custodians for their investors, not to have those resources pocketed by those driven by irresponsible social and political agendas.”</span></p>

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Clint Taylor, for years the extent of his engagement in politics had just been filling in circles on ballots, he said. But now, he’s active in  political advocacy, encouraging people to shift support from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump this year — despite having voted for Trump in 2016 himself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor decided to back President Joe Biden in 2020 and will support Vice President Kamala Harris this year, he said. It’s a move that some Virginia Republicans are making as they seek a candidate whose values align more closely with their own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There must be other Republicans like me out there that are uncomfortable with Trump,” Taylor said in a call. “I just want to tell them that you don&#8217;t have to vote for him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fairfax County lawyer also offered up a testimonial video for a campaign called </span><a href="https://rvat.org/?state_filter=va&amp;text_search#testimonials" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Voters Against Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website features videos from Republicans or former Trump voters around the country sharing why they’re not voting for Trump in this year’s presidential election, according to Rylee Boyd, a campaign spokesperson. Some of the participants voted for Trump during his 2016 or 2020 campaigns, or both, before deciding they can no longer support him. The campaign is investing $50 million in digital advertisements and outreach with a focus on swing states like Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Ryer, a spokesperson for Trump’s campaign in Virginia, is skeptical of some of the video participants. He noted how Virginia doesn’t have party registration when signing up to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am anxious to hear exactly what leads some of these individuals to identify as Republicans,” he said. “As was the case in 2016 and 2020, President Trump is the Republican nominee this year. Might I suggest that if they’ve yet to vote for him and plan on voting against him this year, they may never have been Republicans in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor once considered himself more of a Republican, having grown up in a conservative bastion in Texas, and he agrees with the party’s fiscally conservative approach to governance. But he doesn’t think Trump’s </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/27/trump-harris-tax-cuts-00175441" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to further cut corporate tax rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be able to benefit people widely. More than policy, he is concerned about Trump’s temperament as a national leader and his influence within the Republican party. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two pivotal moments for Taylor came when Trump appeared to refer to the Nazis and white supremacists that violently marched through Charlottesville as “very fine people” and when a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 following Trump’s refusal to accept the 2020 election results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t believe that this man said that,&#8221; Taylor said in his video. &#8220;It still gets me riled up today that he would defend those torch-wielding Nazis.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In a 2017 <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/26/context-trumps-very-fine-people-both-sides-remarks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/26/context-trumps-very-fine-people-both-sides-remarks/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1725466097541000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2DUbwV93uFfBq_4gBdO7ro">press conference after the Unite The Right rally</a>, Trump told reporters that he thought there were &#8220;very fine people on both sides&#8221; and condemned the Nazis within the crowd.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s connections to authoritarian leaders of other countries also concerns Taylor, a sentiment shared by Washington County resident Greg Hawley, who also submitted a testimonial to Republican Voters Against Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a military veteran and retired school teacher, Hawley wants to peacefully enjoy his retirement years. However, he’s been “fretting over this election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley said he’s been concerned about Trump’s growing influence on the Republican party along with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank’s, influence on Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The writings are on the wall,” he said of the foundation’s presidential playbook, “Project 2025,” and of actions Trump has already taken that align with some of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley points to how Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court picks stemmed from Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society recommendations — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of whom upheld Roe v. Wade as federal law during confirmations hearing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s before ultimately ruling to undo the federal abortion protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley sees the ability to get an abortion as “primarily a healthcare issue” and he worries how much Trump might tap into the rest of the playbook. On abortion alone, chapter 14 entails </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/mcclellan-spanberger-work-to-repeal-parts-of-19th-century-law-that-could-ban-abortion-nationally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">employing a long-dormant federal law to further restrict abortion medication and mailing of abortifacients</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Critics and reproductive rights advocates have said this could pave the way for a national ban.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has distanced himself from the blueprint, despite his ties to several of its authors. The foundation has previously published presidential playbooks dating back to President Ronald Reagan, and </span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">touted how Trump utilized previous guidance during his first term as president</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley is also worried about a statement Trump made this summer at a gathering where he told people that “</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tells-christians-they-wont-have-vote-after-this-election-2024-07-27/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in four years, [they] won’t have to vote again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hawley said that moments like that are where he believes Trump has “let it slip” that he would move towards a more “strong arm government.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pushback from politicians</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Democratic National Convention earlier this month, </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/21/who-are-the-anti-trump-republicans-showing-up-at-the-dnc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a handful of Republicans, including former Trump administration officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, offered support for Harris’ campaign. Some high-profile conservative leaders in Virginia are backing Harris as well. Former Republican 10th District Rep. Barbara Comstock</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/18/barbara-comstock-vote-kamala-harris/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said in an interview earlier this month that she will be voting for Harris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and former 5th District Rep. Denver Riggleman hosted a campaign event at his distillery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After Jan. 6, after Donald Trump has refused for four years to acknowledge that he lost, and his threats against democracy, I think it’s important to turn the page,” Comstock said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with The Mercury, Riggleman said he believes that independent and Republican </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/denver-riggleman-says-kamala-harris-could-help-reset-republican-politics/article_b5b21f80-55d9-11ef-b136-ffdc8b61e1af.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters feeling frustrated with Trump can help give her an edge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What it comes down to is the moral depravity of that man — what he&#8217;s done against our democratic institutions,” Riggleman said in a call with Virginia Mercury. “But also his treatment of women, his treatment of immigrants, and what he says about them, his words about military veterans. You get that feeling that this is just a narcissist who only cares about himself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/20/harris-holds-slim-lead-over-trump-in-virginia-roanoke-college-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of Roanoke College shows Harris has a slight lead over Trump. It’s among the first polling since Harris became the new Democratic candidate following Biden dropping out of the race. Democratic strategists </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/26/strategists-analysts-see-excitement-and-pathways-for-kamala-harris-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">see pathways to victory for Harris </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">given her support for reproductive rights and past experience in politics and as a prosecutor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Ryer called Riggleman and Comstock “lapsed Republicans” that are endorsing Democrats to seek “fawning press coverage and appearances on MSNBC.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riggleman also said Trump’s presence looms too large over the party he was once represented. He noted how the contest between his congressional successor U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville and challenger </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John McGuire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hinged largely on whoever appeared to have the most </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/marjorie-taylor-green-calls-bob-good-a-liar-and-john-mcguire-a-loyalist-at-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fealty to Trump</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than policy debates. (McGuire defeated Good, an outcome confirmed after a lengthy recount process and extra court review of ballots in five precincts.)  Riggleman also pointed to how Virginia U.S. Senate candidate Hung Cao — who hopes to unseat Democrat Tim Kaine — emerged from a crowded GOP candidate pool with Trump’s endorsement.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It goes to show where the Republican Party of Virginia is right now,” Riggleman said. “[It’s] so damaged in this state that Cao could get through the nomination process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine and Harris will have Riggleman’s vote this year and while the 5th District is reliably Republican and poses an uphill battle for McGuire’s democratic challenger Gloria Witt, Riggleman said he’s considering voting for her, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This doesn’t mean he always agrees with Democrats on policy, he said, but “at least they don’t want to overturn our Democratic institutions.”</span></p>

A shortage of new homes is driving continued high housing costs, casting doubt on Virginia's future growth. (Parker Michels-Boyce/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democratic lawmakers praised Vice President Kamala Harris’ housing policy plans in a virtual call Wednesday afternoon. The gathering came on the heels of a new </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHgmtsNxT8c" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign ad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlighting Harris’ plan to build three million new homes and rental units if elected president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan is part of a proposal she unveiled ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which includes providing $</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/16/harris-unveils-plan-to-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">25,000 in down payment assistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for some first-time homebuyers and tax incentives for builders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2021 Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt559-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that most Virginains affected by affordable housing issues are  renters. It also found that a declining number of Virginians can afford to purchase a home, while the state has an estimated shortage of at least 200,000 affordable rental units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-Alexandria, said that Harris’ plans will help local governments handle affordable housing issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She can do this by deploying tax incentives to build starter homes to alleviate the shortage of houses on the market for aspiring homeowners,” Beyer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to Harris’ support of increasing </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3238" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low income housing tax credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that local governments could utilize for construction of new homes and apartments. These tax breaks to developers help incentivize development of homes to various percentages of area median income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-to-boost-affordable-housing-advances-to-youngkin/article_33e7b884-dd8e-11ee-96af-a7e0399a77a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">many localities in Virginia lack the authority to utilize LIHTC credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when negotiating developments and redevelopments with companies and a bill that would have expanded those abilities was </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year by the governor. This is where state and federal levels of government can be helpful to local governments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexandria councilman John Chapman stressed how increasing affordable housing options is “not a hyper-local issue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to hear that at the state level, and we love to hear that at the federal level, that there’s a need for supply, and there are also going to be some additional tools,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing is a personal issue for him, Chapman said, as someone benefiting from living in the home that his mother was able to purchase, in part, from down payment assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know personally of the effect of the generational wealth that has passed along from family to family,” Chapman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Harris’ policy platforms will hinge on who controls the U.S. House and Senate next year if she is elected. In Virginia, Sen. Tim Kaine is running for re-election and all 11 congressional seats are in play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyer said that he thinks the fact that both Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have previously served in Congress can bode well for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that he thinks both candidates “struck a bipartisan and post-partisan tone in the convention.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolstering housing supply is also something former president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, wants to address if re-elected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump&#8217;s </span><a href="https://rncplatform.donaldjtrump.com/?_gl=1*q92itj*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MjQ4NTUyNDMuQ2p3S0NBandsYnUyQmhBM0Vpd0EzeVh5dXlZZkRuWFJsLWc0MUZVNGpZYm1lVHl5bDY1bnAtMmJ3UldUWDk3cEdOOTYwUGpVMExpb1d4b0NyRWdRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTEyODczNjg3NS4xNzI0ODU1MjQz&amp;_ga=2.204398551.651488926.1724855243-1160544380.1724855243&amp;_gac=1.22146377.1724855243.CjwKCAjwlbu2BhA3EiwA3yXyuyYfDnXRl-g41FU4jYbmeTyyl65np-2bwRWTX97pGN960PjU0LioWxoCrEgQAvD_BwE" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> include opening portions of federal lands to allow for new home construction while addressing inflation overall, as well as building on previous efforts to r</span><a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-establishing-white-house-council-eliminating-regulatory-barriers-affordable-housing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">educe regulatory barriers to construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his first term in office he created Opportunity Zones meant to attract investors to underinvested neighborhoods, but there’s n</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/business/economy/opportunity-zones-trump-impact.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ot enough evidence to determine if poverty declined more in these zones than elsewhere.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://rncplatform.donaldjtrump.com/?_gl=1*q92itj*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MjQ4NTUyNDMuQ2p3S0NBandsYnUyQmhBM0Vpd0EzeVh5dXlZZkRuWFJsLWc0MUZVNGpZYm1lVHl5bDY1bnAtMmJ3UldUWDk3cEdOOTYwUGpVMExpb1d4b0NyRWdRQXZEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MTEyODczNjg3NS4xNzI0ODU1MjQz&amp;_ga=2.204398551.651488926.1724855243-1160544380.1724855243&amp;_gac=1.22146377.1724855243.CjwKCAjwlbu2BhA3EiwA3yXyuyYfDnXRl-g41FU4jYbmeTyyl65np-2bwRWTX97pGN960PjU0LioWxoCrEgQAvD_BwE" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agenda 47</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from his campaign also alleges that illegal immigrants have driven up the cost of housing. While limited legal immigrants qualify for </span><a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R46462.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal housing assistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, undocumented people could lose their anonymity if they tried to purchase a home or lease an apartment. </span></p>
<p>Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia said that &#8220;Trump will defeat inflation, lower mortgage rates and make homeownership an achievable dream again for Virginia families.&#8221;</p>

(Courtesy of Neighborhood Health) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While respiratory illnesses like the flu typically trend higher in the winter months, COVID-19 is not totally seasonal. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-currentlevels.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high or very high levels of COVID nationwide this summer. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with new vaccines expected to be available next month and the winter months on the horizon, medical professionals in Virginia suggest people get their shots sooner rather than later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“COVID mutates quicker than the flu,” said Heather Harmon-Sloan with Virginia’s Department of Health. “This makes it incredibly important to get the updated COVID-19 vaccine that will be coming out here shortly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because the newer vaccines — approved last week and expected in September —  will be more effective at guarding against the latest variants of the virus. The new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will target the specific strain of the virus that has been attributed to spikes in infections this past spring and summer. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/see-the-numbers/covid-19-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 3%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of emergency room visitors each week for the past three weeks in Virginia have been diagnosed with COVID-19, a number that has been rising over the summer. And while not every case may lead to an emergency room visit, wastewater surveillance to detect the presence of COVID indicates </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-currentlevels.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high levels around the country</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Virginia’s latest surveillance shows mostly a </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-in-wastewater/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plateau around the state with an increase in the Eastern Shore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’re seeing right now is higher than what we saw this time last year,” Harmon-Sloan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also attributes some of the spikes in cases and emergency visits to the inclination to spend more time indoors amid the summer heat — not unlike how indoor gatherings in the winter contribute to infection spikes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Respiratory viruses tend to be able to spread more efficiently when we&#8217;re all indoors, especially if we have poor ventilation,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where opening windows, practicing social distancing and mask use can help reduce infection potential, Harmon-Sloan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while the new vaccines should target the same variant that has been driving the summer wave, Harmon-Sloan said that anyone who was infected this summer could consider delaying the new vaccine for about three months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because those people may have a temporary resistance to the strain having just recovered from it, but she still suggests that people speak with their doctors if they’re weighing when they should get their newest shots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People overall should get the new vaccine — even if they were vaccinated or were sick with COVID 19 earlier this year,” she said. The vaccine that’s emerging “is going to better target those particular variants that are new, that are in circulation right now in our communities, and the cause for these high trends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC will be launching a </span><a href="http://vaccines.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vaccine locator through the vaccines.gov </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">website. Additionally, President Joe Biden’s administration announced last week that it will once again offer free at-home COVID test kits that people can receive by mail. They can be ordered through </span><a href="http://covidtest.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">covidtest.gov.</span></a></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="452" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fentanyl_candy_pills-1024x452.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fentanyl_candy_pills-1024x452.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fentanyl_candy_pills-300x132.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fentanyl_candy_pills-768x339.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Fentanyl_candy_pills.jpg 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Rainbow-colored fentanyl tablets. (Drug Enforcement Administration) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an unstable childhood, Sheyka Lyon said that she had lost herself as an adult with drug addictions. She made her way to Virginia as a sex trafficking victim, she said, but found recovery when tapping into support programs at Caritas — a Richmond-based nonprofit that supports people in recovery from substance abuse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It really does take a village,” she said as she recounted her journey, from receiving help to now working as a peer navigator at Caritas and earning her degree in social work. After speaking to a crowd at the organization’s headquarters on Tuesday, she then introduced Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor focused on the village mindset as he noted various efforts inside and outside his administration to combat fentanyl addictions and support Virginians in recovery. 1,772 people experienced fentanyl-related deaths in 2023, according to the </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/drug-overdose-data/overdose-deaths/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the somber moments reflecting on lives lost to fentanyl overdoses were statements of hope as he announced the expansion of the “It Only Takes One” fentanyl overdose awareness campaign that had piloted in Roanoke earlier this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No community is immune,” Youngkin said of addiction. “We have work to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the year, Virginia First Lady Suzanne Youngkin visited Roanoke multiple times for awareness events promoting the campaign that urges community members to take a pledge to talk to teens about the dangers of fentanyl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also highlighted other efforts to combat fentanyl use and abuse, including Attorney General Jason Miyares’ “one pill can kill” campaign and the Narcan trainings he and First Lady Youngkin have led around the state. Narcan is a commonly used drug to counteract a fentanyl overdose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent legislative efforts to combat fentanyl abuse by Virignia’s General Assembly include  a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1269" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow people in recovery from substance abuse who’ve been convicted of certain crimes to be able to work in treatment centers and a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb469" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">targeting fentanyl manufacturers. Both measures succeeded in the House and Senate and were signed by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there has been bipartisan work to combat fentanyl issues in Virginia, Youngkin has his eye on a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/23/as-fentanyl-surges-virginia-lawmakers-debate-how-far-criminal-penalties-should-go/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create a felony homicide criminal penalty for dealers whose drugs lead to a fatal overdose, regardless of whether or not it was accidental. Some Democrats had pushed back on the idea over the concern that it could go “too far” to charge people distributing drugs that they don’t know contain fentanyl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will put it forward again, and we will do everything we can to get this bill passed,” Youngkin told members of the media Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jill Chicowicz is pleased to see various efforts that help bolster her nonprofit organization’s mission. After losing her twin brother to an accidental overdose in 2017, she founded 2 End The Stigma and worked to raise awareness about fentanyl. Her brother Scott Zebrowski had been prescribed opioids after an injury that led to the addiction that ended his life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, she said that she talks with her teenage sons about the dangers of black market drugs and the risks of addiction. She said she’s pleased to see the Youngkin administration and lawmakers do their part to help families be less likely to experience a tragedy like hers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always tell parents, ‘Open the dialog. Talk to your children. Don&#8217;t be scared,’” she said.  “It is an awkward conversation. It&#8217;s more awkward to bury them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the in-person help, the </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eviction Defense Center website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also has resources that anyone around Virginia can access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tools include understanding the </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/steps-eviction-process" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steps involved in an eviction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/tenant-legal-rights/glossary" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">glossary of legal terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> typically used in housing cases, and </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/tenant-legal-rights/reading-your-documents-and-notices" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explainers on the types of documents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tenants may receive if they are facing an eviction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resources can help people understand the situation they find themselves in, and could also help tenants identify if they have a solid defense against their eviction, said VPLC lawyer Phil Storey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents can double-check if their landlord has taken all the correct steps to proceed with the eviction in the first place. And if not, then the tenant can explain their case to a judge should the eviction proceed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, residents will be armed with enough knowledge of the process and their rights to plead their case in court, Storey said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when someone needs an actual lawyer to represent them, the Defense Center also has a search </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/find-legal-aid" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">feature to connect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people with legal aid centers around Virginia that can help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond has </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/08/21/richmonds-eviction-filing-rate-remains-second-highest-in-us?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslocal_richmond&amp;stream=top" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held the No. 2 spot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the highest eviction filing rate among major cities for nearly a decade. According to an RVA Eviction Lab report through Virginia Commonwealth University, </span><a href="https://rampages.us/rvaevictionlab/wp-content/uploads/sites/33937/2021/11/Eviction-Legal-Counsel-and-the-Courthouse-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40% of evictions in the city last less than 60 seconds in court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPLC hasn’t done a lot of promotion on the walk-in events yet, but “we want to get it out there for folks to be able to use,” Storey said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program could be scalable and a long-term goal is to see about setting it up in other Virginia localities that have high eviction rates. Storey expects his organization will more heavily promote the website and pop-up events in the months ahead and will have coordinated with local libraries in other areas about partnerships by then as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also provided a manual for librarians to be able to help people use this tool as well,” Storey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city of Richmond is also expected to spearhead a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/19/could-this-right-to-counsel-program-for-evictions-become-a-statewide-model/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right-to-counsel pilot program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> next year. With $500,000 earmarked in the latest city budget, the program is not yet off the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, some state lawmakers have hoped to help find ways to resolve things without needing to go to court. Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, carried legislation to extend a waiting period for landlords to serve eviction notices from five to 14 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In current law, </span><a href="https://www.evictiondefensecenter.org/steps-eviction-process" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tenants usually have five days to respond to their notice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — putting them at about 10 days after missed payments before the next phase of the eviction process may occur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB598" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed Virginia’s legislature this year before it was </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+HB598AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Youngkin said he considered the bill “unnecessary” because current law allows tenants a right to pay amounts due before a court date. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Annika Schunn, a paralegal with VPLC explained that delaying eviction proceedings under Price’s two-week proposal could help prevent a court process altogether in some cases. This is because </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ces/publications/length-pay-period.htm#:~:text=In%20February%202023%2C%20biweekly%20was,establishments%20paying%20employees%20each%20week." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">43% of employers pay every two weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since VPLC launched their drop-in times at public libraries this summer, more tenants have dropped by earlier in the month, closer to when they’d have received their eviction notices, Schunn said. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville’s about to become the second Virginia city to adopt ranked choice voting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlottesville’s city council approved a draft ordinance this week that will allow the use of ranked choice voting next year — when primary elections will be held for some council seats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the measure will still need to formally pass at the next council meeting on Sept. 3 (as ordinances must pass twice), it’s slated for the consent agenda at that meeting. The city’s registrar, Taylor Yowell, also </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15lGat6ain7NSIz5BAtHA2U5GA1IP8ZLq/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended its passage in a memo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranked choice voting lets people select candidates on their ballot in the order of preference. Should a candidate win more than half of the first choice votes, they win the election, just as they would have in traditional voting. Should no one get more than half of the votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. If you voted for that person, then your vote goes to the next choice and counts are tallied again. </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/ranked-choice-voting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The process is repeated until there’s a candidate with enough votes to win. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But unlike traditional voting, ranked choice voting means that voters have more input and potential to be satisfied should their top pick not win. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A push for ranked choice voting stems locally from Charlottesville as its former state delegate, Sally Hudson, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/ranked-choice-voting-may-be-coming-to-local-elections-in-virginia-heres-how-it-works/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">carried legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that former Gov. Ralph Northam signed into law four years ago. Now localities can adopt ranked choice voting for city council and board of supervisor elections. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/12/19/arlington-ranked-choice-voting-primary/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first adopted the method last year, following a change in state law granting local governments permission to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond could have been the first Virginia locality to adopt the method in 2022, but councilors were still too uncertain about it at the time and ultimately </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/13/how-uncertainty-sank-richmonds-plan-to-be-first-to-adopt-ranked-choice-voting/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted it down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A key sticking point was that the law could not be applied to school boards or city-wide contests like Richmond’s mayor — which unlike most Virginia localities is a separately-elected official, rather than member of council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s just a more complicated conversation in Richmond,” Hudson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A subsequent effort to allow the law to be used for any local election was </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-blocks-democratic-bills-dealing-with-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/05/10/virginia-gop-picks-glenn-youngkin-as-its-nominee-governor-heres-what-we-know-about-him/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranked choice voting during the 2021 GOP gubernatorial convention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> propelled him to the general election that year where he went on to become governor. But his ranked choice victory didn’t hinge on expansions to Hudson’s law because conventions are party-run contests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Hudson said that seeing ranked choice voting’s adoption and use locally is “a reminder that big changes are a series of small steps.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ranked choice voting is becoming more widely implemented nationwide. It’s currently allowed in 14 states and last year there were over 100 bills concerning it in 38 states, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/preserving-democracy/2023/12/18/ranked-choice-voting-coming-to-more-statewide-ballots-in-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBS reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hudson noted that local, state and federal elections in Virginia in recent years have seen crowded candidate pools ahead of primaries and conventions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Democracy thrives when voters have options between lots of candidates — but right now, our ballots just are not built to let voters vote for who they really like when a lot of people run,” Hudson said. “Ranked choice voting solves that problem.” </span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the sense of what makes a place a home can be strong, Jana Hobbs knows how fragile the ability to remain in a home can be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a transient childhood to a portion of her younger adulthood spent unhoused and on drugs, to coping with mental health issues, Hobbs has had to overcome obstacles to create the sense of home she has now with her longtime partner, their grandson and puppy in an apartment on Richmond’s North Side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs says she and her neighbors could be one medical emergency, family crisis or lapse in employment away from being at risk of losing their housing. It’s part of why she’s “fired up” about ways local and state governments can help people and has started getting involved with the advocacy group New Virginia Majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She applauds the city for tucking $500,000 into its latest budget for </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/sites/default/files/2024-06/FY%202025%20Adopted%20Annual%20Fiscal%20Plan%20-%20Web%20Version%20V1_3.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a right-to-counsel (RTC) pilot program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — which would provide a lawyer for a tenant facing eviction if they could not afford one — and she hopes it can become permanent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s a right to counsel for criminal proceedings, so why shouldn’t we have it for civil cases?” she asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond council member Andreas Addison proposed the program after sitting in on fast-paced eviction cases in Richmond.  According to an</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> RVA Eviction Lab report through Virginia Commonwealth University, </span><a href="https://rampages.us/rvaevictionlab/wp-content/uploads/sites/33937/2021/11/Eviction-Legal-Counsel-and-the-Courthouse-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">40% of evictions in the city last less than 60 seconds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in court and Richmond&#8217;s <a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2023/03/rva-eviction-lab-shines-a-spotlight-on-virginias-high-eviction-rate#:~:text=The%20lab's%20research%20shows%20that,second%2Dhighest%20in%20the%20nation." target="_blank">eviction rate</a> is the second highest in the nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you see a posting of an eviction notice on your door, you&#8217;re given pretty much two options — either pay what&#8217;s owed or leave,” Addison said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he thinks the “third option” — connecting with legal counsel — could help resolve matters out of court, or at least ensure residents going through court are represented by professionals with deeper understandings of the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Addison said that he saw someone he’d known from high school while watching evictions in court. She had set up a separate savings account specifically for her rent payments, which she’d been withholding over maintenance issues. Addison said she’d presented the judge with receipts of correspondence about fixing her apartment to “take her landlord to task” on the matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was like, ‘wow, why is this the way to resolve that problem?’” he said. “My former classmate had read up on what to do and how to handle things, but that’s not what everyone can do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs concurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not lawyers,” she said of some renters. “People aren’t always going to be able to represent themselves.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With legal counsel, Addison believes residents can also become more aware of existing city resources they can tap into like utility bill assistance, or be able to resolve missed payments with their landlords outside of court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately there are many people in our city that are living paycheck to paycheck,” Addison said. “We need to understand, you know, what&#8217;s really going on.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding earmarked for next year</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond&#8217;s program can be a testing ground for applying in other Virginia localities or exploring a statewide program. John Pollock from the National Coalition for Right to Counsel worked with Addison on Richmond’s pilot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pilot does not create a right itself,” Pollock said. “What it will do is expand representation with the hopes of gathering data on how impactful that representation is, which would then allow for a push for an actual right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the city will need to set up the program and funding is earmarked for next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for Richmond’s mayor said that the city would tap a yet-to-be-determined nonprofit organization that could provide the legal counsel rather than hiring or reallocating lawyers in city hall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not going to be in-house,” the spokesperson said. “We’re supporting a nonprofit that’s going to provide these services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar work has already been tested nearby. Equal Justice Works, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit, partnered with local nonprofits where 7 in 10 cases saw success for tenants, according to a </span><a href="https://www.equaljusticeworks.org/news/an-evaluation-of-the-housing-justice-program-and-its-achievements/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Richmond’s city-sponsored RTC pilot will be new, 17 localities nationwide have adopted right to counsel for tenants facing eviction, including Cleveland, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland; and Louisville, Kentucky. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In New York City, which launched the first program six years ago, </span><a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/hra/downloads/pdf/services/civiljustice/OCJ_UA_Annual_Report_2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84% of households represented in court were able to remain in their homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, a bill is pending in New York’s legislature to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S2721" target="_blank">take the program statewide</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">by creating the Office of Civil Representation in New York, responsible for sorting out the staffing of lawyers. Sen. Rachel May, the bill’s patron, says there’s no guarantee it will pass.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A bill will kind of pioneer in New York City, and then when we try to move it to the whole state, it can be harder,” May said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, said the state’s appropriations committee would have to examine the fiscal impact if the legislature were to pursue some form of statewide RTC program. Jones was previously a member of Richmond’s city council. As Richmond’s own pilot gets off the ground, it can be something for state lawmakers to observe, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hobbs is curious to see how the pilot plays out and housing policy is top of mind amid Richmond’s city council and mayoral elections this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Addison said that making sure there is public outreach about the pilot once it’s up and running in Richmond will be crucial. Though he’d hoped for more funding initially, he’s eager to see how things go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, he said, “I think this is a good step in the right direction.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the roughly 2 million Virginians who’d been enrolled in Medicaid before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480,000 of them </span><a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/data/eligibility-redetermination-tracker/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been disenrolled as of this August.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A top reason for disenrolling people from Medicaid is that they no longer meet the financial requirements to be eligible — such as income at or below 80% of federal poverty levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the ineligibility data could point to higher incomes which can be a good thing for people, policy analysts at The Commonwealth Institute caution that is not always the case when it comes to health insurance coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial disqualifications from Medicaid don’t always mean someone has health insurance otherwise, TCI policy director Freddy Mejia explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examples could be someone having a combination of part time jobs tallying up to their overall income — which wouldn’t entail employer-sponsored insurance — or people might have a temporary spike in income through seasonal work that kicks them off eligibility for Medicaid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also non-financial reasons to be removed, which can include </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/16/as-medicaid-review-continues-many-virginians-have-lost-coverage-for-procedural-reasons/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">procedural hiccups like not submitting proper paperwork for reenrollment on time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re seeing a lot of people come off Medicaid enrollment, but we don’t have a clue what is happening with them,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mejia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said. “Future data will take time to see who is uninsured or not after this.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid is a state and federal program that provides insurance coverage to low-income people or people with disabilities. For some people, having Medicaid or even employer-offered insurance may not be enough. For instance, Virginia’s free clinics report an uptick in patients in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these patients are dubbed “ALICE patients,” — or asset-limited, income-constrained, employed people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rufus Phillips, CEO of the Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, said the demographic was contributing to patient uptick even before the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The pinch is much greater on what we used to know as the middle class,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clinics around the state have been a key point of healthcare access for some of Virginia&#8217;s poorest residents along with immigrant and refugee families. They are also a resource for people who are between jobs and insurance coverage — the “safety net to the safety net,” Phillips said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mejia noted how more uninsured people can continue to strain Virignia’s free clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers who may need to serve larger populations than their resources will be able to handle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, there are still about 69,000 people who are still awaiting redetermination for Medicaid. A spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services said that number is a backlog of members that are about 3% of the “total unwinding cohort.” </span></p>

Tim Kaine, D-VA takes a photo with healthcare advocates in Henrico County on Aug. 15, 2024. Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago Congress’ Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law by President Joe Biden after Vice President Kamala Harris cast a tie-breaking vote. Sen. Time Kaine, D-Va visited Henrico County Thursday to celebrate the anniversary and stress its role in reducing healthcare costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Healthcare-specific components of the IRA have included a $35 cap on insulin and overall annual caps on prescription drug prices for seniors. Medicare is also negotiating prescription drug prices as a result of the legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in Henrico, Kaine also heard insights from policy groups and Virginia residents who shared how the IRA helped them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Kizner has been living with a form of blood cancer for a few years and has relied on a series of medications and procedures, including a bone marrow transplant. But his pills are pricey and he joked about “almost losing a finger” to fish a dropped pill out of his garbage disposal in his sink. Though he stepped down from his job amid his diagnosis, his wife has delayed retirement so that he can have health insurance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historian Chris Graham,52, had been worried about managing his Type II diabetes since he was laid off from his job. Thankfully, he said, he was able to obtain insurance through Virginia’s marketplace using tax credits. He’s searching for his next job and noted the role different employment types play in insurance access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to be realistic that maybe my future is stringing together uncertain freelance work for the rest of my life,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freddy Mejia, a policy director at The Commonwealth Institute noted the IRA extends tax credits people can use when obtaining health insurance. With </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/newsreleases/release/VIM-Debut-Sees-Increase-in-Enrollment#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20health%20insurance,the%20needs%20of%20its%20residents." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased enrollment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia’s healthcare marketplace over the past year, he attributes some of that to the IRA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those numbers mean that the IRA is working for Virginia families,” Mejia said. “It’s making healthcare more of a right for all rather than a privilege for some.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the IRA has drawn criticism from Republicans with some calling for its repeal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to protect it,” Kaine said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His own opponent, retired Navy captain Hung Cao, has criticized the bill and been critical of inflation in general. But Kaine said that there’s “no magic wand” federal lawmakers can wave to fix it. What they can do, he said, is reduce costs where they can. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflation has been easing, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/1u9TLPWB-to?si=HvlcG2QiUvocSX87" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rising just 2.9% in July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the lowest it has been in three years. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin announces an initiative to support formerly incarcerated people as they re-enter society in Richmond on Aug. 15, 2024. Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin formally announced a cross-agency strategy to support formerly incarcerated people after their release. <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-36-Establishing-The-Stand-Tall---Stay-Strong---Succeed-Together-Reenetry-Initiative---FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">Executive Order 36</a> directs several state departments to coordinate with each other on data sharing and programming and to bolster partnerships with organizations for programming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no magic wand,” Youngkin said of a single method to improve post-incarceration experiences. “It’s a comprehensive collection of initiatives and relationships.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was joined by cabinet members, his wife Suzanne, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, Attorney General Jason Miyares and formerly incarcerated people who shared stories of getting back on their feet. The goal, they said of the initiative, is to help people become less likely to commit a crime and instead find success in the workplace and their home lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said that when people who have been released from jail or prison end up back in prison, “it reminds us that we must do better.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said the initiative can help people with employment, healthcare access, mental health resources and substance abuse treatment, and “appropriate supervision levels.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measures also include implementing a statewide partnership between the Department of Corrections and Virgnia’s Community College System and exploring increased opportunities to utilize Pell Grants for people behind bars to earn degrees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The expansion of access to Virginia’s Community Colleges and intentional efforts to stimulate workforce readiness are hallmarks of striving to build systems of restorative justice,” Rev. Linwood Blizzard said in a statement. The reverend is a board member with the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, which has praised government efforts to support incarcerated people and their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While calling Youngkin’s re-entry strategy “a good first step,” Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, criticized the governor for rescinding previous administrations’ automatic restoration of voting rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the time Youngkin said his administration began testing out the efforts outlined in the new executive order — April 2023 — he’d also adjusted the restoration of rights process. Once an automatic process upon completing a sentence, people now must apply with little knowledge of criteria for being granted or denied. </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restoration numbers have dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during Youngkin’s tenure compared to three previous governors that had streamlined the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His administration has also pushed back over laws to expand earned sentence tax credits, which incarcerated people can earn through good behavior and completing programs to shorten their time behind bars. The state’s new budget allowed the credits to be </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/10/groups-and-families-celebrate-implementation-of-law-allowing-early-release-for-certain-inmates/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully implemented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The state’s supreme court also ruled in favor of a man who’d served longer time despite earning credits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Supreme Court this past year was very clear on the current sentence credits, and so we&#8217;re fully complying,” Youngkin said Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, he reported that efforts already underway from his initiative have helped 3,000 formerly incarcerated people find work and helped 7,000 people get health insurance. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based on the [former] governor of Virginia, they’re allowing the death of the baby after it’s born,” Trump said of Democrat Ralph Northam, who was governor from 2018 to 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But infanticide is illegal in all U.S. states. Abortion, which terminates a fetus before it is born, is </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title18.2/chapter4/article9/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal for any reason up until around 26 weeks of gestation in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with limited exceptions for later abortions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infanticide allegation stems from a </span><a href="https://wtop.com/ask-the/2019/01/virginia-gov-northam-joins-wtop-live-jan-30/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WTOP interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Northam in which he described palliative care for babies born with severe complications and low survival rates — not abortion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Palliative care is a type of care to keep dying patients comfortable. It’s typically applied to those dying of old age or terminal illness, but can be used for babies born with severe fetal anomalies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clips from Northam’s interview fed into the popular “no limits” or “moment of birth” narrative that abortion opponents have pushed over the years in Virginia and beyond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because [Northam] never provided the full context of the issue, his comments were interpreted that way — and one could see why they were interpreted that way,” said political analyst Bob Holsworth. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How the national allegation took hold in Virginia </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flash back to the winter of 2019. Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax had </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?191+sum+HB2491" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have lowered the three-physician threshold of approval for abortions that occur later in pregnancy.  </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35027" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/19/56-of-virginia-abortions-were-performed-via-medication-in-2021/img_8710/" rel="attachment wp-att-35027"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-35027" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-768x511.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/abortion_legal_sign-2048x1363.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A sign outside a clinic that provides abortions in Richmond, Va. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortions at or after 21 weeks of gestation are rare, </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/abortions-later-in-pregnancy-in-a-post-dobbs-era/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making up 1% of abortions nationally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These types of abortions tend to happen later in pregnancy because severe fetal anomalies aren’t usually detected earlier through tests or ultrasound. They may also happen because a life-threatening emergency arises later in pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title18.2/chapter4/article9/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then and now also allows for instances where continuing a pregnancy would “irremediably impair” a person’s mental health too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a committee hearing on Tran’s bill, Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, asked if the bill would allow for an abortion to occur if a woman were already in labor. Tran answered “yes,” though she later said that she misspoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tran told The Washington Post </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I should have said: ‘Clearly, no, because infanticide is not allowed in Virginia, and what would have happened in that moment would be a live birth.’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holsworth thinks Tran “botched the answer.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When Northam attempted to rectify the situation, he made it worse.” </span></p>

<p><strong>Status of abortion rights in Virginia</strong></p>
<p>Abortion remains legal in Virginia and next year Democrats will begin a process to enshrine protections in the state’s constitution. The measure will need to pass two years in a row with a House of Delegates election in between before it could appear on statewide ballots in 2026. From there, voters will give final approval or rejection.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly claimed that he thinks the matter should be settled on a state by state basis while Vice President Kamala Harris has made restoring federal protections a platform of her campaign.</p>
<p>Democrats are skeptical if Trump is being truthful in his states’ purview stance.</p>
<p>Project 2025, a policy guideline published by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, points to federal mechanisms to further restrict abortion and ban abortion pills nationally. Trump has said he doesn’t know “who is behind” the blueprint, though members of his previous administration authored portions of it. In a recent press conference, he did not rule out having the Food and Drug Administration revoke access to abortion pills. </div>
	</div>
	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam had explained how later abortions typically occur because of fetal survivability issues. He added that if a person were in active labor, a birth would occur. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he added what has since percolated in messaging from abortion opponents in the years since: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the allegation has been </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-ralph-northam-virginia-abortion-952598071326" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">debunked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> multiple times over the years, it has taken a mythic and persistent root in political arguments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Party of Virginia chairwoman Susan Swecker declined to comment when asked about Trump’s rhetoric of Virginia to national audiences and Republican Party of Virginia chairman Rich Anderson did not respond. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortions and palliative care needs will continue</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia abortion providers have reported a </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-08-07/report-as-southern-states-ban-abortion-virginia-sees-increase-pf-out-of-state-patients-seeking-services" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spike in out-of-state patients</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And sometimes patients have had to travel up to Maryland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diane Horvath, an OB GYN, said her Maryland-based clinic is seeing more patients in need of later abortions. Her clinic provides the procedure regardless of how early or late in gestation patients are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As surrounding states have near total bans or restrictions as deep as six weeks, patients are sometimes needing to travel to areas that can legally give them abortions. While some people may not know they are pregnant earlier in gestation, for others it may take time to arrange appointments, leave work, or find childcare. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in the cases of fetal anomalies that might inspire someone to seek an abortion, patients may not find out until after their state’s abortion limit. Some testing that reveals anomalies doesn’t occur </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">until after 15 weeks of gestation and can take about two weeks to reveal results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horvath said that when parents are faced with severe fetal anomalies sometimes aborting the fetus can be the easier choice, while for others that might be birthing, then burying their child, who has died from natural causes after palliative care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Horvath said to insinuate infanticide is “willfully misrepresenting an incredibly difficult circumstance that happens to some families when their baby has a lethal diagnosis.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you ban abortion at a certain point in pregnancy, it just pushes people further into pregnancy. Some people still need an abortion, they just have to work a lot harder to get it,” Horvath said. “That takes a lot of time and a lot of resources, and it&#8217;s just hard on people — nobody would do this unless they absolutely needed it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 50 year old building has had no major renovations since opening in 1974, and its design isn&#8217;t compatible with phased renovations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The building design does not allow for phased renovations, meaning that staff and residents would need to vacate the building for up to 24 months to accomplish any significant and costly repairs,” a release announcing the planned closure stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of this month, there are 46 patients at the center who are being treated for multiple medical and behavioral health issues. With the closure timeline, this gives a multi-year transition opportunity for patients and staff.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will work with families on the available discharge options that meet their loved one’s needs and preferences and maintain open communication with the skilled staff of [the center] about employment at other DBHDS facilities,” commissioner Nelson Smith said in the release.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen.

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginians’ views varied on presidential hopefuls’ immigration stances</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump’s vision, and the GOP’s, has been to continue constructing a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and to ramp up deportations of those who’ve entered the country illegally. Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris’, and  Democrats’, vision has been to enhance pathways to citizenship and address root causes that lead to spikes in migration. They’ve also attempted to work with Republicans on </span><a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/05/24/bipartisan-border-bill-loses-support-fails-procedural-vote-in-u-s-senate/#:~:text=By%3A%20Ariana%20Figueroa%20%2D%20May%2024%2C%202024%207%3A15%20am&amp;text=The%20Senate%20bill%20failed%20to,aid%20package%20earlier%20this%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">boosting funding for border security, but efforts have failed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the state level, Republican Gov.</span><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jan/24/glenn-youngkin-backs-greg-abbott-border-spat-joe-b/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Glenn Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Attorney General Jason Miyares have been</span><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jan/24/glenn-youngkin-backs-greg-abbott-border-spat-joe-b/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> critical</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Biden administration’s border policies. Both endorsed Trump when he won primary elections this spring and both joined him when he held a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rally in Chesapeake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has an established history of false claims about immigrants. He alleged </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/29/politics/fact-check-trump-mental-institutions-migrants-doctor/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">without proof </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that other countries are releasing droves of people from prisons and mental institutions to come into America, among other claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That rhetoric is a “desperate racist play to bring out white suburban voters,” said Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Alexandria, who is among Virginia&#8217;s delegates who will vote for Harris at the Democratic National Convention this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile Loudoun County resident and longtime Republican activist Jo-Ann Chase said Trump’s hardline stance on immigration is one of the reasons she was excited to vote for him last month at the Republican National Convention as a Virginia delegate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are white, brown and Black,” Chase said of Latino and Hispanic voters, a group with which she personally identifies. A lifelong Republican, she’s spent time working on outreach for the party, particularly to Hispanic and Latino communities. She also served on Youngkin’s Virginia Latino Advisory Board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chase said that she hasn’t been bothered by Trump’s rhetoric painting migrants from Latin countries with a broad stroke as criminals. In a speech announcing his first presidential candidacy in 2015, Trump </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Mexico “isn’t sending their best” and that immigrants are “bringing crime, they’re rapists.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chase said it never offended her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understood that he didn&#8217;t say that everyone was like that — but there were a lot of people like that,” she said. “And to ensure that [violent criminals don’t enter], he was going to make sure that the individuals coming across the border did it the right way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Born in Puerto Rico, Chase has always been an American citizen, but she’s lived stateside and been active in Republican politics for much of her life. She feels the border policy during the Biden-Harris administration has been “rewarding” people for breaking the law by entering the country illegally. As she’s canvassed on behalf of the GOP over the past few months, a top concern she’s heard from potential Republican voters in Virginia is immigration policy and border security, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former state delegate Elizabeth Guzman, who is originally from Peru, said she is excited to cast her vote for Harris at the DNC this month. Guzman said she thinks her daughters will see  Harris’ candidacy and“believe that they could be presidents one day,” since Harris is, like them, the daughter of immigrant parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and Lopez said that recently, they’ve been frustrated by how Republicans are framing their party as soft on the border, because Democrats were working with them on the bill this year to bolster border security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lopez alleged that Republicans reneging on the bill — a move that included one of its patrons — allowed immigration to remain a key talking point for Trump’s campaign, and that of congressional representative hopefuls, going into November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s “hypocritical with a capital H” for the GOP to say “look at all this horrible stuff on the border” when they weren’t following through on a solution months prior, Lopez said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Mittlestadt, a communications director with the Migration Policy Institute, said the GOP messaging is “an expected move” given the salience of immigration for the party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration will continue to be a hot topic, regardless of whether Harris or Trump win the White House or which party controls Congress, Mittlestadt said. But, determining which parts of immigration and border security policy will take center stage is the question. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Continuing challenges, inside and outside the state</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventy percent of new U.S. citizens last year reside in 10 states, including Virginia, according to </span><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship-resource-center/naturalization-statistics" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers in Virginia have proposed legislation to support some of its immigrant populations, such as bills this year to allow undocumented minors access to state-funded healthcare and eligibility for careers in law enforcement to certain immigrants. The healthcare bill failed in committee and the law enforcement bill passed with bipartisan support before it was </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/march/name-1023794-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, U.S. immigration policy at the national level has been rather stagnant for decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, to become a U.S. Citizen, people have to apply and have met certain criteria to continue the process. That includes having been a permanent resident in the U.S for at least five years — or in other words, have held a green card or special visa for that amount of time.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People in the immigration process can usually apply for special visas through family stateside sponsoring them or being married to a citizen. Others may qualify for refugee status. Some people — like the thousands of migrant farmers employed in Virginia — may hold temporary work visas.  Others seek employment-based green cards so they can live and work in the U.S. permanently. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a cap on employment-based green cards at 140,000 per year, a number that hasn&#8217;t moved in decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People that come here illegally do so because they can’t come legally,” Mittelstadt said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated population of 11 million undocumented people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in America, she said “that is a sign of the fact that the legal immigration system does not match employer, family reunification, and humanitarian protection needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing the cap on green card types would be a place to start, she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Guzman noted some other “low hanging fruit” she hopes federal lawmakers could agree on, like pathways to citizenship for Temporary Protected Status holders and DACA recipients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TPS holders are people coming from specifically designated countries that are dealing with issues that endanger citizens, such as ongoing armed conflict or environmental disasters.Some of these people may wish to live in America permanently as a result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DACA stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The roughly decade-old program has allowed for some children of undocumented immigrants to remain stateside, but it doesn’t guarantee them the opportunity to become citizens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating the DACA program was the “last time Congress really worked” on immigration issues successfully, Lopez said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to be able to pull multiple levers at the same time,” Mittelstadt of Migration Policy Institute said. “It can&#8217;t just be in border enforcement. It can&#8217;t just be dealing with root causes in Central America. It can&#8217;t just be, you know, individual ad hoc actions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing immigration issues will take sustained collective action by local, state and federal leaders, she said. Until then, she said, one thing remains apparent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The immigration system that we have today is not firing on all cylinders.” </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, the late Lois Dedeaux McClellan voted for her daughter Jennifer to become the first Black woman to represent Virginia in Congress, but there had been a period in her 91 years of life when the law prevented her from voting at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the suffrage movement granted white women the </span><a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/19th-amendment" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right to vote by 1920</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, women of color had to wait to cast their ballots until the federal </span><a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was signed into law, 45 years later. Now on the 59th anniversary of that landmark legislation, Lois’ daughter U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Virginia, is still pressing Congress to ensure fair access to voting for all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fight since day one is who gets to participate,” McClellan said in an interview this week. “We’ve made a lot of progress, but every time we make progress, we face a backlash. It’s up to all of us to really demand that Congress step up and protect and expand voting rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That quest led McClellan to co-sponsor  the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/11?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22freedom+to+vote+act%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom to Vote Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023. The former would restore provisions that have since been removed from the Voting Rights Act of 1965, while the latter would expand voter registration and designate Election Day as a federal holiday. Both bills have been introduced but not progressed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan said she doesn’t think they will get far unless more Democrats are elected into Congress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibited racial discrimination in voting, </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/shelby-county-decision" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling undid parts of the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ,striking down in a 5-4 ruling provisions that gave the federal government oversight when states with histories of racial discrimination sought to change their voting laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the decade since, a number of states have adjusted their voting laws in ways that some advocacy groups say disenfranchise Black voters or other minority groups. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such has been the case in</span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/10/13/georgias-controversial-2021-voting-law-overhaul-survives-preliminary-legal-challenge/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where a 2021 law included restrictions on absentee ballot drop boxes and </span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/briefs/federal-judge-allows-georgia-ban-on-handing-voters-food-water-to-stand/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">penalties for passing out refreshments to people standing in line waiting to vote.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> More recently, a redistricting case in Texas alleges that Black and Hispanic votes were diluted in violation of the Voting Rights Act. Despite a trial judge and appellate court panel both ruling the voter map was in violation of the federal law, the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/us/texas-voting-rights-minorities.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">full federal Fifth Circuit Court disagreed. </span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s nothing new to Fergie Reid Jr., the son of Fergie Reid Sr. — who was the only Black member of Virginia’s House of Delegates when he was elected in 1968, just three years after the Voting Rights Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This s— has always been happening; it never stopped,” Reid Jr. said of barriers to voting or laws that disenfranchise people of color. “Everything didn&#8217;t just change because the Voting Rights Act got passed. It was always a struggle, one step at a time, pushing a rock up a hill. And now the rock is falling back down the hill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the century before the Voting Rights Act Black men had the right to vote and some had been elected. But after the “hot minute” of that, Reid Jr. said, their access to legislative power was “too much for [white] people.”  What followed was decades of Jim Crow laws that disenfranchised people of color. It took until the 1960s for his father to make history as the first Black member of state government since the Reconstruction era following the Civil War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the decade before his  election, Reid Sr. had also encouraged Black voter engagement through the Richmond Crusade For Voters, an organization he’d co-founded that still operates today. When Reid’s 90th birthday rolled around in 2015, his son launched the 90 For 90 campaign to bolster voter registration and candidate recruitment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black representation in Virginia has grown over the past decade. This year, Reid Jr. said he’s focusing recruitment efforts in states where candidates of color or Democrats could face an uphill battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether or not [Kamala] Harris can win, you have to compete everywhere,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broad engagement is something Black Futures Lab political director Alexsis Rodgers said that the organization is working on, as well, inside and outside Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that there are Black community members there who want to be engaged, but they might not be getting good information. They might not know what the latest laws are in their communities,” Rodgers said. “And so in Georgia, North Carolina and Wisconsin, we&#8217;re really focused on doing that outreach.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not totally partisan, the push for enhanced voting access often falls along partisan lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McClellan noted that when she was still a state senator and Democrats held majorities in Virginia’s legislature and governorship, they were “bucking the national trend” in Southern states to broaden voting access rather than restrict it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature passed laws to allow for more absentee voting, the creation of ballot drop boxes, and extended early voting. McClellan, along with Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, also passed the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+SB1395" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act of Virginia </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, as 2024’s elections play out at the local, state and national level, so do proposed changes in who can participate and how. Georgia’s election board has </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-election-board-plans-votes-on-new-rules-after-trumps-praise/KO32B4XY7VCSPNEXHZF5CUJRQ4/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a focus on Fulton County — where a large portion of the state’s Black population votes — which would require “reasonable inquiry” before approving election results. With Fulton County in particular still at the center of former president and current candidate Donald Trump’s claims he actually won the 2020 election, voting rights advocates warn the measures could be misused by board members to reject the results of the presidential race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/05/trump-praises-georgia-election-board/74674946007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">praised Georgia’s electoral board’s proposals in a recent rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though changes to election processes are the purview of state election boards, McClellan said the congressional efforts to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act that have been cast aside could prevent states from making changes that hearken to the days when her ancestors couldn’t vote or were subjected to restrictions like poll taxes and literacy tests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodgers, who has also been a Democratic organizer and supporter of McClellan, stressed that the federal bills are “about protecting democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sometimes that means Republicans will win, sometimes that means Democrats will win,” she said. “But ultimately it means that more people can participate in our democracy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lifelong Richmond resident has tapped into the Health Brigade — formerly known as the Fan Free Clinic — when she needed it. It was there that she was diagnosed with  fibromyalgia (after previous doctors ignored her pain, she said). It’s also where health care workers helped her tackle her pre-diabetes, high blood pressure and mental health strain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan cohort of lawmakers has been touring the state in recent months to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/rural-health-committee-hears-from-maternal-health-dental-specialists-in-farmville/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hear from community members like Roane-Bell and healthcare providers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They’ll compile legislative proposals by the end of the year that the General Assembly could take up in the 2025 session. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia clinics act as ‘safety net to the safety net’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roane-Bell’s mental health challenges in recent years took her by surprise, she said as her voice cracked in a recent phone call. Therapy has helped her cope with grief and the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn&#8217;t realize how damaged I was,” she said as she paused to steady her emotions. “Through the pandemic, I lost a lot of people. I also lost myself, and I didn&#8217;t even realize it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roane-Bell said she might have taken care of her mental health a little sooner if she’d felt open minded to it. Now 60 years old, it’s just not how her generation was raised, she said, or a common topic in Black communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Black and brown folks, we don’t want to accept or don&#8217;t think we need mental health care,” she explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in public housing in Gilpin Court, Roane-Bell also didn’t feel exposed to resources or more education of the role nutrition plays in health disorders. As an adult, she’s been able to remedy pre-diabetes through nutrition education. This is another area she said the Health Brigade has been helpful for her.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don&#8217;t know a lot of things, because nobody even exposed us to them, you know. As far as health care, we don&#8217;t know where to go to get free health care — so we wind up having diabetes that was never treated or high blood pressure that was never treated,” Roane-Bell explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s among many under or uninsured people around Virginia to rely on a free clinic. There are over 70 such clinics around the state, and about 30 of them serve patients in rural areas, Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics CEO Rufus Phillips said at a June rural healthcare committee meeting in Farmville. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group’s tour has highlighted the need for increased state funding to bolster free clinics statewide. As more and more people have been visiting free clinics in recent years, clinics haven’t received an increase in state funding since 2016. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phillips hopes the state can allocate an additional $5 million. This, he said, would pretty much put the clinics back at the 2016 funding levels, considering the state of inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free clinics typically service uninsured people and people whose income is 200% below federal poverty levels. But others have tapped into the clinics as they’ve found themselves between jobs, facing long appointment wait times through Medicaid, or as people have become ineligible for Medicaid this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, Medicaid recipients have their eligibility checked annually — a process that had been </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/medicaid-unwinding-texas-rcna131366" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on pause amid the pandemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But this year began an “unwinding” process as the eligibility checks were restored. About </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/medicaid-enrollment-and-unwinding-tracker-overview/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500,000 people were disenrolled in Virginia this year while 1.5 million had their coverage renewed.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also the added factor of inflation and the rising cost of living placing some healthcare options out of reach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are the safety net to the safety net,” Phillips said of the clinics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Rebecca Butler, VP of communications at the association, operating costs are up 170% from 2016 to 2023. Clinic usage was also up 28% in fiscal year 2023 from 2022. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pandemic pinch</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Phillips said, another contributing factor to the rise in use of free clinics is what are dubbed “ALICE patients” — or asset-limited, income-constrained, employed people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[This demographic] contributed to patient uptick before [the] pandemic,” he said. “The pinch is much greater on what we used to know as the middle class.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the pinch has been felt by Virginia’s free clinics too, as they’ve served more patients over time, exacerbated by the pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the pandemic subsided and restrictions eased, Phillips said the ALICE demographic and others began to rely on the clinics more as “people had put off care” during lockdowns. He also noted the rise in mental health concerns that had, in some cases, been exacerbated by the pandemic too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in periods when Roane-Bell had insurance, she’s felt the weight of co-pays and understands how it leads to putting off care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s like ‘hold up — Do you put gas in the car? Do you buy something to eat? Or do you pay your co-payment?’” she asked. “And guess what happens?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, healthcare can’t be put off forever, and people eventually find their way to free clinics if they have nowhere else to turn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though the Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics is asking the state for more money, Phillips said his organization is also in support of other policies at the state, local and federal level, such as improving Medicaid reimbursement. This could help other providers accept Medicaid patients in the first place and take some strain off of free clinics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s been a relatively new phenomenon,” Phillips said of patients who seek out care at free clinics because they have had trouble finding providers who accept their Medicaid. “Clinics don’t want to hold onto those patients if they can find a Medicaid provider.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris (who has no relation to the vice president) said the days since President Joe Biden announced he was dropping out of his reelection campaign have ushered in renewed excitement for Democrats where she lives in Glasgow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living near the bottom of the Shenandoah Valley, Harris is among a sprinkling of Democrats throughout that Republican-leaning part of Virginia. The in-person and online chatter this week about the incoming Democratic presidential nominee, she said, has been exciting and a “seismic shift” from last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Harris was knocking on doors for her own state senate campaign to challenge Sen. Chris Head, R-Botetourt, voters would mention Biden and express concerns about his age ahead of a potential second term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Kamala Harris is] that injection of energy that those voters I was talking to were searching for,” she said. “I’m even hearing things at the grocery store.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Southwest and Southside Virginia may not be considered blue bastions the vice president can count on this year in her bid for the White House, Harris said she’s still going to be organizing to stir up excitement in its democratic bases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides potential supporters in Virginia’s rural regions, there’s also opportunity for Kamala Harris with younger voters that Biden had been losing, said Sam Shirazi, a lawyer who monitors political trends. On Friday, a coalition of 17 national youth voter empowerment groups </span><a href="https://mailchi.mp/votersoftomorrow/17-youth-groups-unite-to-support-kamala-harris?e=917d428d3e" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Harris, saying in a statement that electing her “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is crucial to the success of our organizational missions and to the prosperity of young Americans.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Harris in, she’s giving Democrats the chance to reach back out to some of the voters that Biden may not have been able to really reach anymore,” Shirazi said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new developments in the presidential race also seemed to boost prospective Virginia voters’ interest this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Virginia Department of Elections, nearly 5,000 people registered to vote between Monday and Tuesday this week just after Biden dropped out — up from around 3,500 new registrations at the same time last week when Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance was announced as President Donald Trump’s running mate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for the department said individual registrars will still need to review the applications to make them official, and Virginia doesn’t register voters by party affiliation — but the numbers reflect people that might have otherwise sat out this election. </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Democratic Party of Virginia said that there&#8217;s been a spike in people approaching organizers to volunteer for Harris&#8217; campaign and that over 2,300 shifts have been scheduled for events around the state this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Bring it home’: Harris’ prospects with Black Virginia voters</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps one of the vice president’s strongest bases of support in Virginia and nationwide is Black women, who both see themselves in her and view Harris as someone who will fight for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic strategist Atima Omara participated on a virtual call Sunday led by an organization called </span><a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/win-with-black-women-zoom-call-harris-organizers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Win With Black Women; roughly 44,000 people participated in the call.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was a good sign, Omara said, and added that she thinks Black-led organizations will help galvanize voters over the next few months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black women in particular, she said, are “gonna bring it home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And like Jade Harris, Omara is seeing excitement in Democrats that reminds her of Obama’s 2008 campaign. Omara relayed how lots of people during that time opened their homes as bases of operations during canvassing efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would not be surprised if we were able to do that again,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to Biden’s withdrawal announcement, Omara recalled interacting with Democratic donors and volunteers who felt less than enthusiastic about how much their time and efforts could matter. But now, she’s seeing the “wildest energy” that she “hasn’t seen in a very long time in Democratic politics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia specifically, Omara already sees pathways for Harris, whom she suspects will capture swaths of voters in Richmond, portions of Hampton Roads and Northern Virginia — all very diverse places that lean Democratic and contain some of the state’s largest Black voter bases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus suburban women — an often white and sometimes swingy voting demographic – could also boost Harris’ prospects in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To accomplish that, Omara said, “white women are going to need to organize other white women.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris’ reproductive health care stance is a selling point</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political analyst Bob Holsworth noted how</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/reproductive-rights-could-be-a-key-platform-for-harris-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reproductive rights will continue to be a strong pillar for Harris overall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With women the most affected by access to reproductive care, the matter has been able to transcend partisanship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a winning issue for Democrats around the country since the overturn of federal abortion protections and even some Republican-leaning states have supported continued abortion access. As Democrats have worked to restore or protect access to abortions, they’ve also promised to defend related issues like in vitro fertilization and birth control access.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ first </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/25/we-choose-freedom-kamala-harris-campaign-launches-first-ad" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign advertisement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> features the Beyonc</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">é </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">song “Freedom,” referencing her position on reproductive health care, in juxtaposition to Trump’s campaign. During his first presidential term, Trump stacked “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the federal judiciary with staunch abortion opponents, including three Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn” federal abortion protections, according to the June 24 American Civil Liberties Union </span><a href="https://www.aclu.org/publications/trump-on-abortion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Republicans tend to advocate for personal freedom in their platforms, Holsworth said it’s smart for Harris to “reclaim” the word from that party in the context of reproductive rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Still, Holsworth noted, Virginia may potentially remain in play for Harris’ opposition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> question is how much the Republicans will target Virginia and try to make it a winnable state,” he said, adding that other states like Arizona and Wisconsin have been more distinctly labeled as </span><a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/july-2024-swing-state-polls-harris-trails-trump-in-arizona-georgia-michigan-pennsylvania-tied-in-wisconsin/#:~:text=Wisconsin%20%2D%20Emerson%20Polling-,July%202024%20Swing%20State%20Polls%3A%20Harris%20Trails%20Trump%20in%20Arizona,Michigan%2C%20Pennsylvania%2C%20Tied%20in%20Wisconsin" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">swing states.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “[Virginia’s] not the first-tier battleground, but it could certainly become one.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Some challenges ahead</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In America, “Black women have been fighting oppression for over 400 years,” said Virginia Commonwealth University political science professor Jatia Wrighten. “So it&#8217;ll be interesting to see what Kamala Harris can do in about 100 days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ forthcoming candidacy — and the chance for her to become the nation’s first woman president and woman of color president — are  cause for excitement and celebration among voters, Wrighten said. However, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should be humbled by the fact that most western democracies have already had women in positions of power.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrighten suspects Harris’ race and gender will be a challenge even if those aspects allure  some people. She points to the “cyclical” nature of racial history in America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had hundreds of years of enslavement, then about twelve years of Reconstruction before the 80 years of Jim Crow [laws that disenfranchised Black Americans],” Wrighten said. “It’s always a step forward and then two steps back.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Obama’s presidency signaled a big achievement for racial parity in politics, it was countered with the rise of the Tea Party movement and other far-right factions of the modern Republican party. Wrighten cautioned that white politicians’ and parental groups’ efforts to remove books from school curriculums and to dilute Black history lessons, and the current pushback against diversity, equity and inclusion policies are the backdrop of the America that Harris is running in now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Wrighten, Omara and Jade Harris said that the vice president’s gender and track record of championing women’s issues can inspire women of all backgrounds to become or remain politically engaged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ prosecutorial background stands to be a strong point for her against Trump among more conservative voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many Republicans typically label most Democrats as “weak on crime,” Harris will be able to point to her experience as San Francisco&#8217;s top prosecutor in the early 2000s and her time spent as California’s attorney general. Her approach was to </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/prosecutor-harris-mixed-criminal-justice-reform-with-tough-on-crime-approach-2024-07-23/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blend criminal justice reform policies with a tough-on-crime stance.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that blended record could give potential Democratic voters pause, especially Black voters, as Black people are </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2023/05/racial-disparities-persist-in-many-us-jails#:~:text=require%20tailored%20solutions.-,Black%20people%20were%20overrepresented%20in%20most%20jails%20with%20relevant%20data,available%20for%20the%20entire%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a stark reflection of America&#8217;s historic and systemic racism. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ background was a bit of a hindrance during her former presidential campaign in 2020, as more localities were electing progressive district attorneys around the country (known as commonwealths’ attorneys here in Virginia). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time Biden had tapped Harris as his vice president pick, the murder of Black man George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer had prompted national outcry and calls for police reform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calls to “defund the police” have been less loud than they were four summers ago and majority-liberal cities are now </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/07/liberal-cities-crime-policies-00145532" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">embracing conservative anti-crime policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but some things stay the same. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/06/03/10-things-we-know-about-race-and-policing-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are still more likely to have negative or deadly encounters with law enforcement — such as Illinois’ Sonya Massey who was shot by law enforcement when they responded to her 911 call this summer, or Virginia’s </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/07/26/irvo-otieno-medical-response/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irvo Otieno</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who died last year amid a mental health crisis, after being held down on a hospital floor by seven police officers and three hospital workers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’ prosecutor record was a mark against her in her previous run for president in 2020 when she was up against a crowd of other Democrats vying for the position. She eventually dropped out of the primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s going to be less of a problem than when she was trying to negotiate the two poles of the Democratic Party,” Holsworth said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the race will feature a Democrat former prosecutor versus a Republican with 34 criminal convictions, playing up her prosecutor past can help her, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appears Harris is already leaning into that strategy. At a <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/07/23/in-milwaukee-vice-president-harris-lays-out-choice-between-compassion-and-chaos/" target="_blank">rally in Wisconsin this week</a>, she alluded to Trump’s criminal convictions and other pending legal woes while hearkening back to her California prosecutor past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I took on perpetrators of all kinds, predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own game,” Harris said at a rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday. “So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while his indictments and convictions are a badge of honor to him, — “I was convicted for you,” Trump told his followers at a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rally in Chesapeake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this summer — they’re a stark contrast to Harris, who shaped her career on the other side of courtrooms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Wrighten said a prosecutor&#8217;s background can be broadly appealing because of the role they play in general public safety. The desire for safer communities is not bound by demographic or voter type, she stressed, and differs “from the ways Black people have good reason to fear police officers.”</span></p>

(Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holsworth anticipates Harris will face sharp criticism from opponents on the economy and U.S.-Mexico border security. However, those areas have always been a vulnerability for Democrats. Harris, who was </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/24/kamala-harris-immigration-border-surge-477810" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made a White House point person</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the border just as a record number of crossings took place, is already facing attacks from Republican political action committees </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/25/trump-allies-harris-immigration-00171187" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over both</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And despite Democrats’ and the Biden-Harris administration’s leadership on the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, its effects have been nuanced, as Americans still face the rising costs of gas and groceries each day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holsworth said presidents overall get “too much credit and too much blame” for the economy, as they aren’t a sole entity in control of its performance. He said it’s hard to convince some voters otherwise when they’re faced with inflation’s effects daily. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the border issue, he said Democrats and Harris are going to need to put Republicans on the defensive about it, by highlighting actions such as a GOP committee </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-kill-border-bill-sign-trumps-strength-mcconnells-waning-in-rcna137477" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killing a border deal earlier this year carried by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, in the days since Biden dropped out of the race, Democratic officials and operatives have spoken out about the accomplishments of the Biden-Harris administration, like efforts to lower some prescription drug costs, expanding environmental policies and helping steer America out of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. But Holsworth said if the party wants to win voters, it’s time to keep the focus squarely on Harris now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Republicans are going to try to paint her as simply the heir to Biden,” he said. “It’s important for her not to be seen that way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Black women and Democrats, Omara and Jade Harris are especially excited to vote for the vice president in November’s presidential election. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first, they’ll be voting for her next month as delegates at the Democratic National Convention where Harris will formally become the party’s presidential nominee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is historic,” Harris said. </span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though now somewhat outdated after President Joe Biden dropped out of his campaign for reelection, a recent </span><a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/virginia-2024-poll-trump-45-biden-43/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerson College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed former President Donald Trump with a two-point lead over him. While forthcoming polling can help shed more light on a matchup between Trump and current Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, the Emerson poll also noted where abortion law could give an edge to Harris’ campaign in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-four percent of polled Virginia voters “would like to see abortion laws be less strict.” Meanwhile, 35% support laws remaining as they are — legal for any reason up to about 26 weeks, with limited exceptions later — and 21% support more strict abortion laws, the poll showed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris has emerged as a national leader in discussing abortion rights — often noting the prominent role electing Democrats plays in retaining or re-establishing abortion rights around the country. Earlier this year, she visited an abortion clinic — an apparent first for a presidential or vice presidential candidate in America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion access has been a winning issue for Democrats around the country in state congressional races since the overturn of federal protections two summers ago. In Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin led an effort to build consensus around a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/abortion-virginia-democrats-republicans/article_7671a5b2-1cef-11ee-b3ed-67d2bc05b52d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15-week ban </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with limited exceptions after that point and most GOP candidates fell in line last year as the entire state legislature was up for election. Amid heated debates about that key issue, Democrats </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/08/virginia-democrats-triumph-in-statehouse-elections-reducing-youngkins-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held their majority in the Senate and gained control of the House of Delegates.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, a </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey found that two thirds of the country believes abortion should be legal in most or all cases.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;At this critical point in our history, the leadership of women, both at the federal and state levels, has become even more important,&#8221; said Virginia state senator Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, who is a voting delegate at next months Democratic National Convention where Harris can formally become the party&#8217;s nominee. &#8220;On this issue especially, the contrast between Kamala Harris and the dangerous misogyny of Donald Trump is a bright and clear line.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reproductive rights advocates began </span><a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/kamala-harris-abortion-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lending their support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Harris soon after Biden’s announcement. Planned Parenthood Action Fund’s CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said in a recent statement that she believes Harris will “continue to fight like hell to rebuild a fundamental right that was stripped away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Trump’s campaign has said Virginia is “in play” among other states that could be key to control of Congress and the White House, Harris’ stance on abortion could be one of her strongest policy positions that could lock down Democratic voters and sway others for whom reproductive rights resonate strongly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in their re-election campaign before Biden dropped out, he and Harris announced restoring federal abortion protections as a key pillar of their platform, and </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/elections/biden-harris-virginia-abortion-rights/article_2470d9f4-ba0b-11ee-8a33-cf7a3fed9ec7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the same sentiment in Virginia. Democratic leaders around the country have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/florida-abortion-ban-six-weeks-virginia-susan-swecker/article_e5c13ac8-0708-11ef-9bfa-831eade60f7b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also stressed reproductive rights as a key focus of this year’s elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from abortion, other areas of reproductive rights have emerged as campaign talking points this year as well. When Louisiana’s Supreme Court ruled that embryos are people, it called national </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-elizabeth-carr-first-ivf-baby/article_4e86ef1e-d7f5-11ee-a484-f38d84585aab.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">access to in vitro fertilization into question.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia brought Norfolk, Va.-born Elizabeth Carr as his State of the Union address guest this year — she was the first American born of IVF. Democratic members of Congress have pressed for a bill to support IVF access nationwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ve also tried to pass a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-contraception-virginia-general-assembly-hashmi-price/article_c74b197a-fb59-11ee-92c1-1b2a173616ec.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to protect contraception, as have state lawmakers Sen. Hashmi and Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News. Though Hashmi and Price’s measure passed the state legislature, it was vetoed by Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price accused the governor at the time of “aligning with the most extreme parts of the Republican Party despite overwhelming support for right to contraception bills.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A largely Democratic yet not totally partisan issue, reproductive rights may continue to feature as prominently in Harris’ presidential campaign as they have nationwide. </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators met on Thursday and</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?242+sum+SB6012" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">passed bills</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to repeal changes to a college financial aid program for military veterans’ families and designate $90 million towards sustaining it for at least the next two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program (VMSDEP) provides education benefits to children and spouses of severely injured or killed veterans. Amid the rising costs of the program in recent years, an effort to downsize it appeared in the state budget that lawmakers passed and Youngkin signed earlier this summer. That move was met with swift pushback from military families, who called for the changes to be reversed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A point of contention throughout the summer has been who should take the credit — or blame — for the changes, as lawmakers met several times attempting to resolve matters. Members from both parties have acknowledged a desire to fix what several deemed a “mistake,” and to study the matter further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Clearly, we did this in the budget and quite a few of us didn’t understand the implications,” Sen. Richard Stuart, R-King George, said during a Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee meeting earlier in the day. “We are trying to fix it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter military spouse Kayla Owen, who’s prodded lawmakers all summer to protect the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During public comment at the committee meeting, military spouse Kayla Owen — who has prodded lawmakers all summer to protect the program —  said that she didn’t feel like the day’s proceedings should be something legislators should pat themselves on the back too much for. While speaking to the committee, she urged lawmakers to stop “sneaking contentious or highly controversial legislation through the budget.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement gave Stuart and Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, pause; they both asked Owen if she’d rather they leave and not pass the bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both in a rebuttal to Owen and in an interview with media after the committee meeting, Lucas stressed that the changes to the program originally stemmed from the governor’s administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing was tucked into my budget,” Lucas said. “The bill came out of the governor&#8217;s office. So I just want to make sure I cleared that up.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curious about details leading up to the now-repealed changes to the program, Owen has sought internal communications from the governor’s office for insights into how the changes came about in the first place. Despite being a member of a task force Gov. Glenn Youngkin created to study the program and its future sustainability, Owen’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/05/youngkin-administration-denies-foia-request-from-member-of-own-task-force/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freedom of Information Act request was denied.</span></a></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Youngkin administration denies FOIA request from member of own task force&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/05/youngkin-administration-denies-foia-request-from-member-of-own-task-force/embed/#?secret=5wWKeoYdEW#?secret=kLPyikq0it" data-secret="kLPyikq0it" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>After the legislature&#8217;s actions, Youngkin signed the bills and said in a statement he and lawmakers &#8220;took the necessary step to reverse and fully repeal changes to VMSDEP and provided significant new funding for the program. We will continue our work to make Virginia the best place for our military, veterans, first responders and their families to live, work, raise a family, and retire.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the bills passed Thursday to continue funding the program for two years, Virginia’s Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission will conduct a study and Youngkin’s task force will analyze the program, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owen said she hopes the situation will encourage lawmakers to stop using the budget to legislate, as changes to VMSDEP done through a standalone bill originally would have been able to undergo a robust committee process. She suggested that the original VMSDEP changes were made “under the cloak of darkness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody’s blaming each other and it’s like that Hamilton song ‘Room Where It Happens’— nobody else is in the room where it happens!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the matter resolved for now, lawmakers will have their eyes on the various groups that are analyzing VMSDEP. As the costs of the program rise, Lucas stressed that lawmakers need to figure out how to make sure it can last for future generations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[The passage of bills on Thursday] will allow us to have a solution while we await results from the JLARC study and other groups to ensure that the program is sustainable in the long term,” Lucas said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the legislature reconvenes for its 2025 session, it could take up adjustments to the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Owen, who has spearheaded military families’ advocacy for keeping the program, she said Thursday’s actions are “a sigh of relief until January.”</span></p>

Virginia’s health department wants to better understand it, so it’s about to conduct a new study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest study will focus on Southwest Virginia residents after an initial analysis on Central Virginia last fall.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long COVID </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">is diagnosed when symptoms persist for months or longer after a person’s initial viral infection. It’s something that John Bolecek of Richmond unfortunately knows very well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After his family’s January 2022 bout with the virus, Bolecek said the disease “derailed” so many aspects of his life. He experienced insomnia, weight loss, and constant malaise. The fitness enthusiast had to trade his arduous runs and bike rides for gentle walks, though he often must rest most of the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My life looks nothing like it used to. I was an employed, active father of two who loved taking his kids on bike rides, hiking, and adventuring,” he wrote in a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/06/a-life-derailed-by-long-covid/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guest column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Virginia Mercury last year. “If you see me out in the world, I may look normal, but just know I’m still suffering, as are many others experiencing long COVID, and I’m expending my very limited energy budget in strategic ways so my family can function as normally as possible.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36135" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/06/a-life-derailed-by-long-covid/newriverbikepack/" rel="attachment wp-att-36135"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-36135" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/newriverbikepack-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  John Bolecek on a bikepacking trip along the New River Trail, May 2021. (John Bolecek)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With long COVID a relatively new medical phenomenon, his symptoms also overlap with another lesser-studied condition — </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/me-cfs/about/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With little known about either condition, Bolecek is hopeful that lawmakers can bolster research through funding.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/81/2024/07/CV-LC-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preliminary report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">based on interviews with 68 participants from last fall’s central Virginia-anchored inquiry found that 88% of the participants with long COVID symptoms were not up to date on their vaccinations. At the onset of Bolecek’s contraction of COVID and subsequent symptoms, he was vaccinated and boosted, but he did have asthma. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High blood pressure was common among participants and the majority of people with long COVID symptoms reported severe or moderate symptoms during the initial infection that may have triggered the lingering symptoms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such triggers included physical activity, stress and mental activity. About 57% of participants were able to work, but with difficulty, while others needed to reduce hours, work remotely, or found themselves terminated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine has also struggled with long COVID symptoms and has used his personal experience to spearheaded efforts at the national level, including research, to address the disease. . </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year the National Institutes of Health </span><a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-bolster-recover-long-covid-research-efforts-through-infusion-515-million" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redirected $515 million </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in federal funding for the RECOVER Initiative, first launched in 2021. By the time funding was running low last summer, </span><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/09/long-covid-nih-trials/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advocates had been skeptical of the trials conducted so far</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bolecek believes a permanent office should be created to focus on long COVID research and treatment because “without a permanent program, there is little incentive for new doctors and academic researchers to specialize in this field.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part in Congress, Kaine continues to press for passage of the bipartisan </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/long_covid_support_act_bill_text.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long COVID Support Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which he and U.S. Sen. Todd Young, R-Indiana, introduced last summer.  If passed, the bill would authorize centralization of data sets regarding patients with long COVID and related conditions for future research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m glad that the Virginia Department of Health is conducting this study and that the Biden Administration has taken steps to better support Americans with Long COVID,” he said in an email. “ I will keep pushing to pass my bipartisan bill to accelerate research on Long COVID, educate providers, and expand resources to patients.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican National Convention began Monday, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin helped kick off the festivities by celebrating former president Donald Trump, who became the party&#8217;s official nominee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gathering in Milwaukee, Wisconsin took place days after a shooter attempted to assassinate Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania. Trump’s ear was injured, two men were wounded and an attendee was killed at the July 13 event. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin ordered flags raised at half-staff to honor the life of Corey Comparatore, who died shielding his family from the bullets while attending the Trump rally on Saturday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his RNC speech, Youngkin offered prayers for the victims and Trump, before pivoting to issues plaguing Americans like high mortgage rates, increased grocery and gas costs and &#8220;the silent thief of inflation, unleashed by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.&#8221;</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39318" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-touts-trump-as-fellow-outsider-republican-businessman-at-republican-national-convention/iowarnc/" rel="attachment wp-att-39318"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39318 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IOWARNC-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IOWARNC-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IOWARNC-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IOWARNC-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IOWARNC-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IOWARNC-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IOWARNC-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The floor of the Republican National Convention on its first day, Monday, July 15, 2024. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin went on to reflect on his 2021 win as a Republican in a state that has trended Democratic over the past decade. He noted how, like Trump, he is an &#8220;outsider businessman&#8221; who brought his business background to politics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In November 2021, Virginians elected a Republican outsider businessman as their 74th governor,” Youngkin said as one of the featured speakers at Monday’s convention. “And I believe this year Virginia will elect another Republican outside businessman as president of the United States.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s name had </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4769841-kevin-mccarthy-donald-trump-glenn-youngkin-veepstakes-2024-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been among</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a few rumored to be considered for Trump’s vice presidential pick. By Monday afternoon, however, freshman Ohio senator and author of the bestselling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” J.D. Vance had been announced as Trump&#8217;s VP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he had when his name surfaced last year as a potential presidential candidate, Youngkin has kept his comments on national attention more narrowly focused on Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I love my job. I love what we’re doing in Virginia,” he said recently.“I wake up every morning with a spring in my step and I go to work knowing Virginia is absolutely on a roll and it’s exciting to see it happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the day, Youngkin participated in a panel on policies to boost manufacturing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appearance came shortly after Virginia reclaimed the top spot on CNBC’s annual ranking for best states to do business in — marking the sixth time the state has snagged the number one placement across multiple gubernatorial administrations.</span></p>
<p>With the Democratic National Convention set to convene next month in Chicago, President Joe Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee. Virginia&#8217;s Democratic Party reminded voters on Monday night that they had thwarted some of Youngkin&#8217;s goals as governor with their gains in last year&#8217;s House of Delegates elections.</p>
<p>Last year, Youngkin had propped up a 15-week ban on most abortions as a key platform for many GOP candidates. Democrats took control the the House and held their majority in the Senate.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After voters rejected his plan to ban abortion by electing Democrats to take control of the state legislature in 2023, it is clear that Virginians want a change and reject Republican policies that push us back by generations, not move us forward into a brighter future,” DPVA chair Susan Swecker said in a statement Monday night. </span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of a </span><a href="https://www.dmas.virginia.gov/media/3lvdytyw/2023-medallion-acute-annual-technical-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">commissioned by a state department shows that a majority of low-income pregnant people newly enrolled in Medicaid aren’t able to access prenatal care in a timely manner due to processing issues stemming from managed care organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managed care organizations are insurers paid by the state to provide Medicaid coverage, which is a federal and state health insurance program that typically serves low-income or disabled people. In Virginia, Medicaid is administered by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, or DMAS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Medicaid enrollees are handled by managed care organizations, or MCOs. DMAS commissioned the “secret shoppers” survey to test the efficacy of Virginia’s contracted MCOs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DMAS</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> monitors the MCOs in many ways,” Mary Olivia Renter, a spokesperson for the department, relayed in a statement. “The Secret Shopper Survey served as an innovative addition to our many processes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It found that 95% of the nearly 2,000 survey participants were unable to set up prenatal care. Causes included reaching disconnected numbers, excessive hold times, or the numbers connecting to out-of-state providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey also concluded that the MCOs were not compliant with DMAS’ wait time standards. This means that pregnant people would also be unable to set up doctor appointments while waiting for the MCOs to process their applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a new method of data collection and auditing, DMAS noted the limitations of the survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The surveys assessed a small sample of providers for the timeliness of new patient appointments only, not overall access to an appointment,” Renter wrote. “Due to the nature of the Secret Shopper Survey, callers were unable to provide any personal information or details required for preregistration. This was stated as the most frequent reason cases were unable to be offered an appointment or schedule an appointment within the appointment standards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the survey helped to highlight some concerns which, anecdotally, advocates and prenatal professionals said they have been hearing from people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PUSH Maternal Health Coalition, a cohort of various advocacy groups, gathered at Virginia’s capitol on Tuesday to highlight the survey results. They also implored lawmakers and the governor to support legislation to enhance maternal healthcare access more broadly and to “hold MCOs accountable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our hope is that MCOs see this as an opportunity to advocate for legislation they may need to improve access,” said Kathryn Haines, the health equity manager with the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Association of Health Plans, a lobbying organization that represents Virginia’s MCOs, said their clients asked them to respond to media inquiries on the matter. Representative Heidi Dix said that the organization and its members are “keenly aware of the need for overall improvements in prenatal care” and that they are “fully engaged” to address issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This report and other analyses have identified a variety of factors placing a historic strain on prenatal care, the Medicaid program and the overall healthcare sector,” Dix wrote in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the disparities hit close to home for several members of the PUSH Coalition Tuesday — particularly when it comes to Black maternal health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kenda Sutton-El, director of doula and maternal health advocacy organization Birth In Color, said the survey didn’t surprise her. Instead, it helped confirm what she’s personally seen both as a Black mother and a doula with Black clients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This just validated the experiences of many Black pregnant women who have tried to navigate the complex world of managed care organizations against a backdrop of significant disparities,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While studies and data show that </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">negative health outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mortality rates are higher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when Black people give birth than white people, Sutton-El wants lawmakers and officials to think more critically about the systemic contributions to such data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Instead of saying Black women are three times more likely to die, we have to start using language like, the system is actually murdering Black women at three times the rate,” Sutton-El said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nichole Wardlaw, a midwife with the American College of Nurse-Midwives and the National Black Midwife Alliance, said requirements for implicit bias training when renewing medical licenses must be a legislative priority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, a bipartisan effort to do just that cleared the legislature before being </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in May. With racial bias one component of negative health outcomes, Youngkin did more recently issue an executive order to reestablish a maternal data task force (</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/27/youngkin-to-reestablish-maternal-health-data-task-force-after-vetoing-bill-that-would-have-done-so/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">after vetoing a passed bill that would have done so as well</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephanie Spencer, a nurse and founder of Urban Baby Beginnings, commended the governor’s executive action. The coalition said they hope to see the governor signing laws, issuing orders, allocating funding and voicing support for these issues more often. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s still a lot of work that needs to be done, and obviously this survey shows that we need to do better,” Spencer said.</span>        <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/subscribe" style="text-decoration:none;">

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santia Nance and Quadaire Patterson’s love story is entering a new chapter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A law took effect last week that allowed certain incarcerated people to be released from prison for acquiring earned sentence credits. Patterson is now also earning good fiance points by “doing every dish” in the house since he moved out of prison and in with Nance. The couple’s long-fought-for chapter entailed years of political advocacy and maintaining hope. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Opportunity is nothing without hope,” Patterson said as one of the featured speakers during a press conference at Virginia’s Capitol on Tuesday. “I relish the opportunity to be able to represent the incarcerated and all of my reentering brothers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Nance had gathered at Virginia’s Capitol on Tuesday with various prison reform advocacy organizations and Democratic lawmakers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterson was among people to be released last week. July 1 is when new laws typically take effect each year, but in this case, a four-year-old law was finally able to be implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earned sentence credits are applied to shorten inmates’ time behind bars. Incarcerated people can achieve them through things like good behavior, participation in programs and seeking educational advancements. Prison reform advocates stress that earned sentence credits help incentivize rehabilitation so that families can be reunited sooner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s legislature passed a law in 2020 that increased the number of credits inmates could earn and expanded it to people serving time for both violent and nonviolent offenses. It had a delayed start date for 2022, but that year Gov. Glenn Youngkin blocked its implementation through the state budget. It’s a law that Nance, through her work co-founding a group called Sistas iIn Prison Reform, has hoped for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizations like Sistas in Prison Reform continued to advocate for its implementation. Before his release Patterson kept his fellow inmates in the loop on legislative processes, and he was also able to connect with Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Alexandria. </span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko carried the Senate version of the bill in 2020. Del. Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, had the House version — and his own lived experience as a formerly incarcerated person who has since gone on to become Virginia&#8217;s first Black Speaker of the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Democratic-controlled legislature was able to get the earned sentence credits through this year’s budget with Youngkin’s signature, Republican resistance remains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the celebratory gathering, Attorney General Jason Miyares issued a statement calling earned sentence credits a public safety risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe in redemption and am a strong proponent for helping our returning citizens re-enter society to live productive lives. However, aggressive retroactive sentence reductions for violent criminals with a high risk of recidivism undermines our justice system and disregards victims,” Miyares wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares also wrote a letter earlier this year to lawmakers urging them to keep Youngkin’s budget language in place that would have blocked implementation of the 2020 law. He has used the influence of his office to advocate against various other criminal justice reform efforts in the state’s legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko bucked Miyares’ characterization of the legislation at Tuesday’s event, saying he and some other Republicans want to “get everybody worked up into a frenzy” ahead of next year’s state legislative elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Data shows that earned sentence credits help reduce recidivism, no matter what he says,” Boysko said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next year, all 100 seats in Virginia’s House of Delegates will be up for election and Virginians will elect a new governor. With criminal justice reform often a Democratic-led issue, partisan control of the House or governorship could determine what future bills might succeed or fail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until then,  recently released Virginians will be settling back into their unincarcerated lives. Patterson will continue his education with the hope of eventually becoming a lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wedding plans are also on the horizon. Nance is ecstatic about having Patterson home with her and how their shared passion for advocacy is intrinsic to their love story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It really is a full circle moment to be standing here with him,” she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key accomplishment of the Biden-Harris administration has been the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which also entailed various cost-reducing incentives for environmental actions and forthcoming negotiations with pharmaceutical companies over prescription medication costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The declaration of support comes after four Democrats in Congress said during a call on Sunday that Biden should end his candidacy, </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/four-democrats-congress-call-biden-step-2024-race-rcna160625" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to NBC News. Separately, The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/mark-warner-joe-biden-exit-race-democratic-senators/" target="_blank">reported</a> that Virginia’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner was trying to marshal support from his colleagues to call for Biden to step aside. His office released a statement Monday afternoon that didn’t confirm or deny that account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of the impending election, “</span>now is the time for conversations about the strongest path forward,” Warner’s statement read in part. “As these conversations continue, I believe it is incumbent upon the President to more aggressively make his case to the American people and to hear directly from a broader group of voices,” about how to defeat Trump.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Black leaders in Virginia’s legislature,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/race-politics/4759620-joe-biden-donald-trump-debate-maxine-waters-jim-clyburn/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prominent Black members of congress have also reaffirmed their Biden backing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including Virginia Democratic </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/07/politics/house-democrats-biden-out/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democratic governors like Maryland’s Wes Moore have also </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/president-joe-biden-white-house-jeff-zients-7794155c12bc78c084e4b964545e2b7f" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spoken in support of Biden this past week.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At age 81, concerns over his mental and physical capacities began circulating in political punditry following his performance in a June 27 debate against former President Donald Trump. Biden appeared to lose his train of thought at times and stumbled over his words. His voice was also soft and raspy. A </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646547/age-issues-working-trump-advantage-pre-debate.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June Gallup poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found the American voters surveyed are “nearly twice as likely to say Biden is too old to be president (67%) as say this about Trump (37%).” Trump is 78 years old. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/08/biden-in-first-tv-interview-since-debate-denies-medical-condition-it-was-a-bad-episode/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> called</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his debate performance a “bad night” that stemmed from fatigue and a “really bad cold,” in a recent interview with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president reiterated during the interview that he does not plan to drop out of the race. When asked about the possibility of undergoing a cognitive test and making the results public, Biden refused to commit, adding that the demands of his job as  president equates to taking a cognitive test each day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the Republican and Democratic national conventions have yet to take place, Biden and Trump are the presumptive nominees for their parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The choice is between two visions,” Bagby wrote in the VLBC statement of support. “A second Trump presidency would set us back a generation. We have full faith that a second Biden presidency would keep us moving forward.” </span></p>

Bob Good, R-Campbell, speaks at a campaign rally in Powhatan County. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having likely lost to challenger state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, 5th Congressional District Rep. Bob Good is seeking a recount. The Virginia State Board  of Elections certified primary election results Tuesday — which opened a window of opportunity for candidates appearing to have lost by less than 1% of the vote to pursue a recount if they wish. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the loss at less than 400 votes, Good is entitled to a recount, but his campaign will have to cover the costs of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good’s campaign manager, Diana Shores, said that people in the district have been reaching out to the campaign to ask for a recount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our donors, our volunteers, and our supporters expect it. This isn’t about Bob Good. This is about the people of the district,” she said in a text message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shores said that the recount can “settle any questions about the fairness and transparency of the election process” so that “voters can confidently move forward to the general election.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the state elections board <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/02/virginia-officials-defend-free-and-fair-elections-as-primary-results-are-certified/">certified the results</a> of the June primaries on Tuesday, chairman John O’Bannon said Virginia’s elections were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“free and fair.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nV9LiL7T6A"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/02/virginia-officials-defend-free-and-fair-elections-as-primary-results-are-certified/">Virginia officials defend ‘free and fair’ elections as primary results are certified</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia officials defend ‘free and fair’ elections as primary results are certified&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/02/virginia-officials-defend-free-and-fair-elections-as-primary-results-are-certified/embed/#?secret=TeF0oXKQe9#?secret=nV9LiL7T6A" data-secret="nV9LiL7T6A" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>In a statement Tuesday, McGuire called the election results &#8220;the honor of a lifetime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I look forward to continuing our fight for Virginia families every day in Congress.&#8221; He asked voters to support him and former president Donald Trump, adding that without &#8220;Trump and a Republican Congress, we will lose our great country.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good, first elected in 2020 — the same year former president Donald Trump lost to president Joe Biden — has challenged the results of the Biden-Trump matchup, as has McGuire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two-term congressman has previously won the GOP nomination through a convention process before topping Democratic challengers in the conservative-leaning district spanning parts of central and Southside Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Good faced state senator McGuire in a district-wide primary, which meant more people were able to vote. Though similar candidates in many ways when it comes to conservative Republican policy platforms, fealty to Trump became a highlight of their contest, as Trump and Biden face off again this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last summer Good briefly endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for president. This was shortly after some of Trump’s indictments had been announced (and Trump has since been convicted on 34 counts in one of the pending cases, involving payments to an adult film star). When DeSantis dropped out of the race, Good immediately re-endorsed Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump went on to endorse McGuire and sent a cease and desist letter to Good’s campaign for signs that included Trump’s name — implying an endorsement he didn’t have. </span></p>

Bob Good, R-Va, has been sent a cease and desist letter from former President Donald Trump for including his name on signs, despite his endorsement for Good&#8217;s opponent John McGuire.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a recent rally in Chesapeake, Trump spoke about several Republican congressional candidates in Virginia, including a shoutout for McGuire that commended his military service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know a lot of tough guys and they wanted to be Navy SEALs. It was their dream to be a Navy SEAL. … They couldn&#8217;t get there,” Trump said. “It&#8217;s a very tough thing to do. It&#8217;s really tough, guys,” adding that McGuire is “a tough cookie” who is “doing a good job” as a state lawmaker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoever wins Virginia’s 5th District congressional race will face Democrat nominee Gloria Tinsley Witt in November’s general election. A Republican-leaning district, voters have </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/us-representative-5/district/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically favored GOP candidates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though Democrat Tom Periello represented the district from 2009 to 2011. </span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darryl Byers-Robinson choked up as he stood before a crowd of about 30 at Virginia&#8217;s Department of Corrections headquarters in Richmond on Monday with various advocacy groups and members of Virginia’s DOC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The groups had gathered to celebrate the first year since the full reestablishment of eligibility for incarcerated people to receive Pell Grants. The grants, a federal subsidy for some qualifying undergraduate students, have not been applicable to incarcerated people for much of the past 30 years. That’s because the passage of the 1994 Violent Crime Bill made incarceration a disqualifier for Pell Grants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Byers-Robinson attributes his participation in a pilot program that allowed him to receive his associates degree as an example of how higher education can change someone’s life. His voice cracked and eyes watered as he recalled beginning his post-incarceration journey. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember the day when I got released — one of the things I held on tightly to in my folder was my degree,” Byers-Robinson said. “I knew it was going to give me an opportunity to do something powerful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has since gone on to serve as a pastor and public speaker. He’s also currently involved as an organizer with Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byers-Robinson earned his degree by participating in the pilot program while incarcerated in New York through Bard College. Around that time in 2015, there were also four colleges in Virginia that had been part of a national Pell pilot program  through the U.S. Department of Education. Flash forward to July 2023, and Pell became fully accessible to people behind bars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are currently 10 correctional facilities in Virginia that have established partnerships with community colleges for inmates to pursue associates or career technical education degrees with Pell Grants, as of July 1, 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of colleges is expected to grow;  Virginia Wesleyan and Brightpoint Community College are currently going through the application process to partner with correctional facilities, officials said Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Rev. Kieth Jones, a Virginia Interfaith Center board member, and Virginia DOC director Chadwick Dotson noted the role that education plays in reducing recidivism.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The more education we can provide, the better outcomes are,” Dotson said of people being more prepared to find work and less likely to reoffend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A January 2023 national study</span><a href="https://www.mackinac.org/30588" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that prison education programs reduced recidivism by about 15% while rates of employment for ex-offenders had increased about 7%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s still more work to be done, Dotson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that entails expanding high speed internet access for incarcerated students to be able to take advantage of virtual learning options through their colleges. Currently, students are limited to on-site classroom locations in their prisons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allison Kroboth, a software engineer, Resilient Professional Community Manager  and former Fluvanna Correctional Center For Women inmate, recalled at Monday’s event the roundabout ways she had to retrieve research materials for coursework while earning her associates degree in 2013. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had to fill out a form through her prison and then volunteers with Piedmont Virginia Community College would research the requested subjects that Kroboth would then have to pay 10 cents per page to get her hands on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was a long process,” she said. “So we had to go about our assignments way in advance to make sure there was time for someone to get our research to us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson said that’s where investing in some on-site technology like tablets could help students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are there any legislators that want to toss us some money? We’ll use it for education, I promise,” Dotson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, like Byers-Robinson, Kroboth used her degree to go into advocacy work for people with similar lived experiences to her. In addition to being a website engineer for Resilience Education, she is a mentorship program coordinator for the nonprofit that connects formerly incarcerated people seeking to use their degrees and reestablish their lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a chance for these people “to come together and learn from each other,” Kroboth said of the mentorship programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The significance of the moment wasn’t lost on Byers-Robinson, who was a featured speaker Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am standing here as an example for all of the people in prison,” he said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CHESAPEAKE — &#8220;We win Virginia, the race is over,&#8221; former president Donald Trump told a crowd of more than a thousand at Historic Greenbrier Farms in Chesapeake on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and opponent President Joe Biden each held rallies following their debate the night before. Biden held one in Raleigh, North Carolina earlier in the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a roughly hour and a half-long speech, Trump took several victory laps for not entering America into new wars and pressing Congress to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 during his first term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump made several factually inaccurate statements during his remarks. One example was his false claim that in 2020, protesters in Portland, Seattle and Minneapolis were &#8220;ripping people apart and killing people&#8221; during demonstrations that roiled the nation after a Black man, George Floyd, was killed by a white police officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With border security still a key issue for Trump in this election, he alleged without proof that other countries are releasing droves of people from prisons and mental institutions to come into America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the former president took the stage, the gathering had a county fair vibe, but Trump-themed. Attendees milled about, perused Trump merchandise, and visited food trucks in a large field on Historic Greenbrier Farms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake resident Renee Cobb said she’s not been particularly pleased by either presidential candidate and that this presidential election feels like picking between the “lesser of two-evils.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy-wise, she gravitates Republican, so attending the rally was a way for her to hear directly from Trump more about his plans should he be elected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He really skirted a lot of questions that I would have been interested in,” Cobb said of the debate the night prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cobb described the debate as a “s&#8212; show” for both candidates, though she thinks it went worse for Biden. </span>The president, age 81, spoke in a voice that was often soft and raspy, stumbled over his words at points, and appeared to lose his train of thought a few times. A June Gallup <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646547/age-issues-working-trump-advantage-pre-debate.aspx" target="_blank">poll</a> found the American voters surveyed “are nearly twice as likely to say Biden is too old to be president (67%) as say this about Trump (37%).”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My biggest thing from the debate last night was that the Democrats are even saying Biden isn’t fit,” Cobb said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump played into those impressions throughout his speech Friday, taking jabs at Biden and often calling him &#8220;Crooked Biden&#8221; and &#8220;Sleepy Biden.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Rich Vanderford’s vote for Trump has never been in question. The North Carolina resident drove to Chesapeake on Friday to attend the Trump rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that he’s been frustrated with the rising cost of living and inflation in recent years and hopes that Trump will be able to help alleviate that. He also supports Trump’s plans for tighter U.S.-Mexico border security and the former president’s more assertive stance when engaging with foreign governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel like World War III is right around the corner,” he said of international conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war and tensions between Israel and Hamas, which governs Gaza in the West Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump mentioned that he&#8217;s the only &#8220;competent&#8221; candidate that can prevent that, saying he wants America to have defense systems similar to Israel&#8217;s dome.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin at a rally in Chesapeake, June 28, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speakers at the event included Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, GOP U.S. Senate nominee Hung Cao, former Republican governors Bob McDonnell and George Allen and U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, who represents the second congressional district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, who</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/03/06/virginia-governor-youngkin-endorse-trump-president/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> endorsed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trump in March, said &#8220;Joe Biden&#8217;s path to retirement runs through Hampton Roads.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans’ race against Democratic challenger Missy Cotter Smasal could likely be close by November, as the Virginia Beach-anchored district often oscillates between partisan control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we saw last night was elder abuse,&#8221; Kiggans said Friday afternoon of Biden’s performance in the presidential debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal’s campaign is buffeted by investments from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and potential next Speaker of the House, Hakeem Jeffries, has endorsed her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic Party of Virginia organized a nearby gathering earlier in the day that was supposed to support Smasal’s campaign, but she pulled out at the last minute. The event, featuring military veterans and DPVA chair Susan Swecker, put Trump on blast for past comments referring to military members killed in action as “suckers” and “losers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives from Smasal’s campaign, DPVA and DCCC did not provide comment by the time of this publication as to why Smasal — a Navy veteran — did not attend.</span></p>

Abigail Spanberger, D-7th, speaks to a crowd in Richmond, Virginia on the second anniversary of the overturn of federal abortion protections. (Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are finally talking about the Comstock Act — and they are finally trying to repeal it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The act is a dormant 19th century federal law that’s still technically on the books and could be used to implement a national abortion ban. Named for activist Anthony Comstock who pushed for it, the 1873 </span><a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section1461&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prohibits the mailing of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the “Stop Comstock Act,” U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., announced legislation last week that would repeal portions of it. A House version of the bill is co-sponsored by Virginia Reps. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond and Abigail Spanberger, D-Henrico.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More broadly, the Gilded Age-era law focuses on obscene materials such as pornography, but other provisions of it have included abortifacients and contraception. The contraception components were stripped away over the years. While its abortion components have not been enforced, the law has been used in child pornography prosecutions. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22legislation%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22%5C%22comstock%5C%22+AND+%5C%22abortion%5C%22%22%7D&amp;pageSort=dateOfIntroduction%3Aasc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four previous attempts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from decades ago to repeal the abortion components of the act have failed and McClellan was candid about how her bill may not see success in the U.S. House right away due to its current GOP control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That doesn’t mean we don’t start fighting,” McClellan said, noting how it took her about a decade to pass legislation to remove abortion barriers when she was a state senator in Virginia. “Hopefully it will be the next Congress, under Speaker Hakeem Jeffries, that we pass that bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeffries, the House Minority leader from New York, stands to become the next Speaker of the House if Democrats are able to take control of the chamber in this year’s elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Showing their work on Comstock can help Democrats communicate about threats to abortion access amid this year’s presidential and congressional elections, said Erin Covey, an analyst for the Cook Political Report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the reason that this is coming up now is because we&#8217;re getting closer to the presidential election,” she said. “The potential reality of a second Trump term is something that Democrats in Congress are reckoning with right now.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why does this particular law matter?</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has </span><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/110384051064378318" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taken credit for</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">how his Supreme Court picks during his presidency ushered in the fall of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that federally protected abortion for nearly 50 years. With speculation at how far he would seek to regulate abortion, he’s said different things in interviews with national press over the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While President Joe Biden has made abortion protection a pillar of his re-election campaign, Trump has made </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/compare-2024-candidates-health-care-policy/?utm_campaign=KFF-Health-Policy-101&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_HRRnbnWlwDVW2NM5l9DQk1jYM_RqWvqC6w7ohqGbfp_j_cbuKLZ05Xq7-b22j0fd-elvauV1HskryaKFS-80nxUFu2dQz3wq4ZTMK3CjN0iGvNgo&amp;_hsmi=312903414&amp;utm_content=312903414&amp;utm_source=hs_email#abortion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various statements</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ranging from supporting a national 15 or 16 week ban, to leaving regulation to the states, and “feeling “strongly” about Comstock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an </span><a href="https://time.com/6972022/donald-trump-transcript-2024-election/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">April interview with TIME Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he said he’d have a “big statement” within two weeks, but he never did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also said earlier this month that he would “</span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-says-hell-work-side-side-group-wants-abortion-eradicated" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work side by side”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a group that wants to see abortion “eradicated.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though Comstock’s abortion provisions were not enforced during the nearly 50 years of Roe, it has been a looming specter for the abortion rights movement all along. Activists and legal scholars have cautioned about its potential as it is still technically on the books. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a Trump-appointed Texas’ judge’s interpretation of Comstock that helped propel the Federal Drug Administration v Alliance For Hippocratic Medicine to the U.S. Supreme Court. Though the Supreme Court, which has several Trump appointees, did not rule in the Alliance’s favor, they kicked the case back down to lower courts where it will continue to be litigated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most directly, the Comstock Act applies to mailing abortion medication, but some think it can be interpreted further to prohibit transport of supplies to establish abortion clinics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While “not literally a ban,” legal historian Mary Ziegler explained how abortion opponents can interpret it to be used as one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The question is, if you can&#8217;t put anything in the mail or through a common carrier or potentially into interstate commerce, then how do you get surgical tools or whatever? How do you get any of the items you would need?” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comstock’s </span><a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-14.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appears in a conservative manifesto called “Project 2025” that Trump could tap into should he win a second term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter 14 of the policy guidebook by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation recommends that promotion and approval of mail-order abortion medications cease and alleges they are “in violation of long-standing federal laws that prohibit the mailing and interstate carriage of abortion drugs.” Comstock’s legal code is then cited in footnote number 16. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local government officials have tried for years to use Comstock to limit abortions in their communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law has surfaced in local ordinances around the country, such as in Virginia where it was </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/a-virginia-county-considered-19th-century-approach-to-abortion-restrictions/article_2b72de8a-9b04-11ee-9864-1fbc992a7e0e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year and in New Mexico where </span><a href="https://sourcenm.com/2023/12/14/n-m-supreme-court-hears-arguments-on-local-anti-abortion-ordinances/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legal challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have ascended to the state’s supreme court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assisted by former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, Texas activist Mark Lee Dickson has </span><a href="https://sourcenm.com/2024/03/04/texas-activists-pushed-abortion-restrictions-in-nm-cities-and-counties-records-show/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">encouraged localities to pass such ordinances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Dickson also has said that they offer legal representation to localities that </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/abortion-roe-versus-wade-youngkin-bristol-tennessee-virginia/article_31281cfc-15f1-11ee-8559-9b85d4db3696.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“goes up” to the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be it Trump utilizing Comstock if elected, or legal challenges progressing successfully in Dickson’s favor through courts, Dickson’s confident it can be a path for a national ban. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If enforced, it would have the same impact as a national ban on abortion,” he said. “That is because it is a de-facto national abortion ban.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legal historian Lauren MacIver Thompson, who specializes in Comstock, echoed Ziegler’s theory of how that could work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If Trump is reelected, (abortion opponents) basically have a clear path to enforce it with a newly re-formed Department of Justice,” said legal historian Lauren MacIver Thompson. “They can kind of read the act however they want it to be read.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin announced a new executive order to reestablish a maternal health data task force a little over a month after vetoing legislation designed to accomplish the same goal.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/EO-32---Maternal-Health-Task-Force---FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 32 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reestablishes the Maternal Health Data and Quality Measures Task Force, which was first established in 2021 and ran through the end of last year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal was, and is, to collect maternal health data that can inform future policy but the report with recommendations from the previous task force was not published in time for the 2024 legislative session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Del. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB781" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 781</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year to reestablish the board and it cleared both chambers with bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin then pursued a shorter substitute, which Herring said “gutted” her bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposal also removed the term “birthing people.” Pregnancy is most common in cisgender women. Meanwhile, for transgender and nonbinary people who are pregnant, finding competent medical care can be a challenge, </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/for-many-pregnant-trans-people-competent-medical-care-is-hard-to-find" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PBS News reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the legislature reconvened in May, they rejected Youngkin’s proposal and he vetoed the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, the proposed legislation politicized an otherwise noncontroversial issue,” Youngkin’s veto statement had said. “I offered an amendment to address this, but unfortunately the General Assembly did not adopt it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herring feels it was Youngkin doing the politicizing of an otherwise bipartisan bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems like this is truly being politicized by the executive order,” Herring said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for Youngkin did not respond when asked if Youngkin’s veto statement was in reference to Herring’s inclusion of “birthing people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new task force will include various health care and maternal health care officials such as OB GYN doctors, nurses and midwives, as well as representatives from various state agencies and nonprofits related to health care information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know who he&#8217;s going to appoint but he did keep some of my structure for the task force in the executive order,” Herring said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike his shorter substitute, Youngkin’s executive order is longer and includes details from Herring’s bill such as examining the quality of care and barriers that prevent collection and reporting of timely maternal health data. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cohort will develop recommendations for standard quality metrics on maternal care and report findings to both the governor and state legislature by Dec. 1, 2025. There is also a Dec. 1 deadline this year for the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to provide a report with recommendations for ways to address maternal mental health and substance use issues to help eliminate disparities in care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the previous task force’s  </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD136" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are to mandate a year of postpartum coverage for commercial insurance plans, identify reimbursements to incentivize social determinants of health screenings, and to develop a fetal and infant mortality review team — a bill from this year that was</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB140" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tabled until next year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infant mortality review team was among a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-black-maternal-health-carroll-foy-youngkin/article_4608fd84-d1ae-11ee-8379-138efdfc34c7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slate of maternal health bills this session</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, carried primarily by Black women lawmakers; while some advanced, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">others were vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herring said in a Thursday interview  that she’s been in touch with the administration about composition of the new task force. This week, she spoke with John Littel, who is Youngkin’s new chief of staff and former head of the department of health and human resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not yet clear when the new task force will be up and running or if previous members will rejoin it and a representative from the state health department could not be reached by the time of this publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite divergence on details of the task force, lawmakers in both parties have worked on various measures to enhance maternal health outcomes in recent years. Youngkin has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">supported maternal health hubs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of the Partnership for Petersburg initiative. He also signed a bill this year to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require health insurance coverage for doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mothers play an incomparable role in the lives of their children and families, and it is imperative that we do the necessary, collective work to ensure they are receiving the care they deserve,” Youngkin said in a release announcing his order. “This begins with knowing where we need to improve, so that we can better maternal health policies throughout the Commonwealth and promote the well-being of women, children and families.” </span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My story includes abortion — a guy I&#8217;ve known since I was a kid raped me,” actress and activist Ashley Judd shared with a crowd of about 100 in Richmond on Monday to mark the two-year anniversary of the overturn of federal abortion protections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And when I became pregnant, I was so grateful that I was able to access safe and legal abortion,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judd, who was a prominent figure amid the #MeToo movement to advocate against sexual assault and harassment, joined state and federal lawmakers Monday to stress the significance of abortion access amid this year’s presidential and congressional elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though the personal story Judd shared was grim, the attitude of the event was light at times; Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, celebrated the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/08/virginia-democrats-triumph-in-statehouse-elections-reducing-youngkins-power/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic gains made in the state legislature last year </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">while U.S. Reps. Jennifer McClellan, 4th District, and Abigail Spanberger, 7th District, celebrated camaraderie among women in politics. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the seriousness of abortion laws was central to the gathering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs held by participants read “This is Trump’s fault” — a reference to how President Donald Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court picks gave conservatives the majority to overturn Roe v. Wade, the nearly 50 year-old case that had guaranteed abortion rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you think Dobbs was the beginning, it wasn&#8217;t,” McClellan said, in reference to the 2022 case that overturned Roe. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39056" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39056 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2149-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attendees hold signs in Richmond, Virginia on June 24,2024 for a political rally on the second anniversary of the overturn of federal abortion protections. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted how in the years following, legislators and legal cases have challenged contraception and in vitro fertilization, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump will face off against current president Joe Biden this November, as will congressional and U.S. Senate candidates around the nation. While Biden has made abortion protection a key pillar of his campaign, another Trump presidency and GOP gains in congress could usher in further abortion restrictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot afford Republican-controlled governance. We cannot afford a Republican-controlled Congress,” Lucas told the crowd. “Our freedoms are at stake: Freedom to vote, freedom to contraception, freedom over our bodies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas and Spanberger stressed how before Democrats held their line in the state senate and flipped the House of Delegates last year, they’d blocked Republican-led attempts to restrict abortion in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Spanberger, who is not seeking another term in congress and is instead running for governor, could be the person to sign other reproductive health-related legislation into law in 2026. That year, voters statewide could also see a potential ballot referendum to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-abortion-rights-restoration-same-sex-marriage/article_731f82a4-b4b0-11ee-9c14-7719906ce1fc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decide if abortion protections should be enshrined in Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in a place where we have seen desperate people come from other states, because Virginia is the only state in the South that has not put additional restrictions in place,” Spanberger said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That fact was reiterated several times later in the morning in a roundtable discussion at the VCU Health Hub in Richmond’s east end. McClellan was joined by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services acting director Melanie Fontes Rainer, Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax and Del. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond to hear from reproductive health professionals. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A turning point’</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From various providers of reproductive healthcare, to those who assist with births and political advocates, each person had insight to share. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Longtime OB-GYN William Fitzhugh, Whole Woman’s Health CEO Amy Hagstrom Miller, Kenda Sutton-El of Birth in Color and Stephanie Spencer of Urban Baby Beginnings shared concerns about the influx of out-of-state abortion patients.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39055" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39055 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2297-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Lawmakers and reproductive healthcare professionals participate in a roundtable discussion in Richmond, Virginia on June 24, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hagstrom Miller said that there’s been an uptick in patients visiting Whole Women’s Health from Georgia and Florida – where most abortions are banned after six weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted how last year, a patient&#8217;s menstrual cycle had continued after she conceived, so she was unaware she was pregnant until she had lost the ability to receive an abortion in Georgia. The patient, Chasity Dunnans, then traveled to Whole Woman&#8217;s Health’s Charlottesville clinic for the procedure. As many other southern states impose near-total bans or six-week limits, North Carolina and Virginia stand as a point of access for some. But </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/n-c-s-12-week-abortion-ban-to-make-va-least-restrictive-state-in-south/article_5ac91606-f503-11ed-b9b5-2315241bf865.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina’s 12-week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cap meant </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/31/virginia-abortion-rights-ban-south-state" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunnans had to travel further</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are at a turning point here in Virginia,’ Boysko said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She has carried a proposed constitutional amendment that would enshrine abortion access in Virginia’s constitution. This would make access less subject to partisan turnover in the state legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To alter the constitution, Boysko’s resolution will need to clear the legislature two years in a row, with a House of Delegates election in between, before appearing on statewide ballots for voters to accept or reject. Pending its first passage next year, this could happen in 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Abortion isn’t always a partisan issue,” Hagstrom Miller said. “Everytime we put abortion on the ballot, it wins.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the two years since Roe was overturned, voters have backed abortion rights in red states like </span><a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/03/05/august-was-not-a-fluke-kansas-advocates-warn-against-raft-of-bills-limiting-reproductive-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kansas </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2023/11/08/ohio-voters-pass-issue-1-constitutional-amendment-to-protect-abortion-and-reproductive-rights/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and blue states like </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-health-california-89310197d2b3bd3e3ba806620dd2bdbb" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in competitive states like </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2022/11/10/braving-long-lines-michigan-college-students-help-propel-dem-proposal-3-victories/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a patchwork quilt of different abortion laws exist around the country. So, as people travel to other states to receive abortions, privacy and criminalization concerns have emerged. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rainer noted a </span><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2024/04/22/biden-harris-administration-issues-new-rule-support-reproductive-health-care-privacy-under-hipaa.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new Biden administration rule </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that strengthens privacy protections. It will prevent reproductive healthcare information from being shared for criminal investigations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bolstered patient privacy and trust isn&#8217;t just about your records,” she said. “It&#8217;s about ‘am I too scared to go back to an emergency room or to go back to a facility to get the care that I need? Am I too scared to keep information from my doctor because I&#8217;m trying to protect myself or I&#8217;m trying to protect my doctor? Or is my provider too scared to give me information because they risk criminal liability?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Virginia has taken on the issue at the state level. After vetoing it previously, this year Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a bill this year to </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-menstrual-data-virginia-search-warrants-general-assembly/article_b2ea107c-f5b8-11ee-ac2c-ab1a87d2cca1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prohibit menstrual health data from being subject to search warrants.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But  he vetoed a companion bill that would have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-menstrual-data-virginia-search-warrants-general-assembly/article_b2ea107c-f5b8-11ee-ac2c-ab1a87d2cca1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">prevented Virginia from complying with extradition requests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for patients who travel from states with bans to receive abortions in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concurrent with abortion legislation, lawmakers from Virginia and nationwide have sought to protect access to contraception and in vitro fertilization. Youngkin vetoed a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">right-to-contraception</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bill this year while congress’ right-to-contraception and IVF efforts have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/u-s-senate-gop-prevents-contraception-access-bill-from-moving-ahead/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been stalled </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">as well. Lawmakers say they will keep trying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is imperative that we take action at the state and federal level,” Cousins said. “It’s concerning to me that with one election, we could go all the way backward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Judd noted how some who seek abortions are already mothers and may not be able to afford to care for more children, an example of the various reasons a woman may need to end a pregnancy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Becoming a mother or a parent is a profoundly human endeavor. It rests on our hearts and on our souls,” Judd said. “It involves circumstances that are deeply practical — our light bill, our pocketbooks, housing, social support — and it often involves faith and prayer. And what it should not include is the United States government.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rural health committee met in Farmville this week as part of ongoing efforts to hear from community members and experts on rural healthcare disparities and brainstorm ways to fix them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assembled </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/12/scott-announces-special-committee-on-rural-health-care-access/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this year,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the bipartisan cohort has been hosting meetings around the state to focus on different challenges to healthcare access in rural communities. The group is also tasked with delivering policy recommendations by the end of the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of those recommendations may include trying again on bills that didn’t cross the finish line this year or were vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such was the case for a bill to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB286" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reestablish a maternal health task force</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which had been tabled for this year, and a bill to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb35" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">require unconscious bias training</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when renewing medical licenses, which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin vetoed last month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An effort to collect data on </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB140" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fetal and infant mortality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had also been tabled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katie Page, a certified nurse-midwife with Centra Health who serves as the legislative liaison for the American College of Nurse-Midwives said she considered those policies to be important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Page was among presenters at the meeting where maternal health was a focus of discussion. As a midwife, she explained the role the medical professionals play in labor and delivery as well as prenatal and postnatal care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maternal health was a focal point of Tuesday’s meeting in Farmville in Virginia’s South Side. Other topics included overlapping issues with regards to access such as dental care and how free clinics have been “safety nets” for communities since Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/02/virginias-uninsured-rate-dropped-after-medicaid-expansion-new-report-finds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded Medicaid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several years ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workforce development was a shared concern for the various industries and a suggestion that emerged during the discussion was a sales pitch to medical professionals about working in rural areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polly Raible, director of Delta Dental of Virginia Foundation, said “we’re not doing enough” to ask medical professionals what would bring them to rural areas. And, she added that Virginia isn’t doing enough to “sell” what’s attractive about rural areas and working in them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge that the different groups shared was transportation for patients — be it travel time and cost or less access to public transportation options. The matter also popped up when the committee met in Tazewell this past spring, the first of its several meetings scheduled throughout this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we&#8217;re finding out is that even if you can find a provider, so many people can&#8217;t get to them or their follow up visits,” said Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, who chairs the committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally from Farmville, Willett recalled how his own family had to drive up to an hour away for dental care growing up. That’s not feasible for everyone, he said, and added that allocating state and federal funding towards transportation can help families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Money of course could always be part of the equation, but we&#8217;ve got to look at that,” he said.  “But once you’ve got the funding, can you find a transportation company willing to provide services in a really rural area? We’ve got some figuring out to do there; this (issue) just keeps hitting us in the face.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suspects transportation struggles will surface in future presentations at future committee meetings. The next meeting is slated for mid-September on Virginia’s Eastern Shore. Willett said the details are still being finalized. </span>        <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/subscribe" style="text-decoration:none;">

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the closures of obstetrics services at several rural hospitals around Virginia, state and federal lawmakers are hoping to help where they can. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican lawmakers from southwest Virginia </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earmarked funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the new state budget to attract OB-GYN medical residents, while Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner has </span><a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/d/b/db64187c-8170-4b41-93c7-2e292710d7e4/671BBC17FF60624673294CC49BA54FA4.061724-keep-obstetrics-local-act-discussion-draft-leg-text.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drafted a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help limit obstetrics closures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the “Keep Obstetrics Local Act,” the federal legislation would increase Medicaid payment rates for labor and delivery services to hospitals in rural and high-need urban areas. It would also provide payments to help hospitals cover the cost of staffing and maintaining obstetrics at low-volume hospitals and require all states to provide postpartum Medicaid coverage for up to 12 months after birth (which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-will-expand-medicaid-coverage-up-to-a-year-after-pregnancy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia already does</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recruiting and retaining these professionals is one reason rural hospitals are shutting down their obstetrics units.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In some parts of Virginia, we’ve got a declining population, but also if you’re an OB-GYN, you can make more money in a suburb or urban area,” Warner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money is both a problem and solution, Southwest Virginia resident Wendy Welch said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the director of the Southwest Virginia Graduate Medical Education Consortium, Welch’s organization helps cover costs of bringing medical residents into Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While family practice doctors and midwives play an important role in care for pregnant people, OB-GYN doctors can be useful for high-risk pregnancies and complicated births. They’re also a key component of hospitals having obstetrics units. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To catch a unicorn — to catch someone who’s that valuable and knows they’re that valuable, you need a whole lot of stuff to attract them now,” Southwest Virginia resident Wendy Welch previously told the Mercury. “If they’re a kayaker or their mom is in Southwest Virginia, you’ve got them, but if not, how are you going to get them here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner said his bill can help hospital systems spend money to recruit and pay OB-GYN specialists. He noted how addressing maternal healthcare intersects with other work that public and private sectors are doing to bolster rural communities such as job creation and broadband buildout. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re not going to bring good quality jobs if a future young mom can&#8217;t get the health care she needs,” Warner said. </span></p>

Bob Good, R-Campbell, speaks at a campaign rally in Powhatan County. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Final results of the intra-GOP brawl in the 5th district between U.S. Rep. Bob Good and state Sen. John McGuire might be a ways off. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With McGuire’s lead of about 300 votes and yet-to-be received mail-in ballots, the race hasn’t been called in any candidates’ favor just yet. A busy week of work lies ahead for the Virginia Department of Elections to count votes and for the state’s Board of Elections to certify results on July 2. From there, the Good-McGuire matchup could be headed for a recount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law allows for candidates to request a recount if the margins are less than 1%. Such was the case last fall when Kimberly Pope Adams challenged Del. Kim Taylor, R-Dinwiddie, to represent the 82nd district in Virginia&#8217;s House of Delegates. After ostensibly losing by 78 votes, the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/recount-confirms-taylor-topped-adams-in-petersburg-area-house-contest/article_c69ada60-9ea7-11ee-a157-dbbd0e803587.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recount </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed that Taylor had topped Adams by 53 votes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Thursday, Good’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry into whether he is considering a recount, but he noted optimism in a social media </span><a href="https://x.com/GoodForCongress/status/1803455257487323318" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This race remains too close to call. We are in a period where the law provides a process for evaluating the accuracy of all the vote totals from election day to ensure everyone can have full confidence in the certified results,” he wrote. “Provisional ballots and mail-in ballots are also still to be counted. We are asking for full transparency from the officials involved and patience from the people of the 5th District over the coming weeks as the certification of results is completed. We believe we can still prevail.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the Department of Elections will receive mail-in ballots by noon Friday, as long as they have been postmarked on or before election day. The department will also review and verify provisional ballots, which are typically used when someone forgot identification while voting or if someone is registering on the same day that they’re voting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all the various ballots are counted, the state board of elections will certify election results on July 2. Once completed, Good would have 10 days to file a petition for a recount if he meets the less than 1% threshold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the 5th Congressional District is reliably Republican-leaning, the primary matchup between Good and McGuire was hotly contested — </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/marjorie-taylor-green-calls-bob-good-a-liar-and-john-mcguire-a-loyalist-at-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at times drawing national attention</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More locally, it represented the lawmakers’ different factions and styles. Good hails from Campbell County where he served on its board of supervisors and McGuire has represented the Goochland area in the state legislature for several years. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good has previously been insulated by a </span><a href="https://www.cvilletomorrow.org/foregoing-a-primary-election-means-just-2000-people-will-be-responsible-for-selecting-the-5th-congressional-district-gop-candidate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">convention nominating process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with tuned-in party activists while his challenge from McGuire is the first time he’s defended his seat in a district-wide primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But former President Donald Trump loomed large in the Virginia race. Aside from the various high-profile congresspeople who stumped for both men and former Trump strategist Steve Bannon rallying with Good — Trump backed McGuire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Good has been a longtime fan of the once-and-possibly-future president, it’s his brief endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last summer before he dropped out of the presidential race that has haunted Good. He backed DeSantis shortly after </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/07/politics/trump-indictments-criminal-cases/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">indictments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were levied against Trump for cases that are </span><a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/briefs/georgia-court-of-appeals-pumps-the-brakes-on-fultons-2020-election-racketeering-case/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still playing out in court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race, Good supported Trump again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire’s campaign went on to label Good a “Never Trumper.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By definition, you can’t be a ‘Never Something’ that you have documented evidence that you currently are (a supporter of),” Good </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bob-good-john-mcguire-donald-trump-5th-district-primary/article_a5c98b6a-07e8-11ef-85a9-b7027fc5fc26.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said at a campaign event this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38870" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire01-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-38870" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire01-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MTGMcGuire01-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Va, has been sent a cease and desist letter from former President Donald Trump for including his name on signs, despite his endorsement for Good&#8217;s opponent John McGuire.</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Trump didn’t forget the months Good boosted his former opponent and fealty to Trump emerged as a key issue between the candidates leading up to the primary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“John McGuire has my complete and total endorsement,” Trump said in a </span><a href="https://www.virginiascope.com/trump-participated-in-a-tele-rally-for-john-mcguire/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tele-rally for McGuire ahead of the election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “I want that to be understood, because Bob Good’s going around saying we’re friends. I mean, he was fine the last six months, but before that, he was a basic disaster.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Trump loyalty was a litmus test that attracted national attention, congressional races are still somewhat local in nature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If there’s one thing I guess we can take away is that a Trump endorsement alone — even in one of our most conservative districts — does not necessarily guarantee an outcome,” Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Warner said during a press call on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whoever wins will face Democrat nominee Gloria Tinsley Witt in November’s general election. A Republican-leaning district, voters have </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/us-representative-5/district/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">historically favored GOP candidates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though Democrat Tom Periello represented the district from 2009 to 2011. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, McGuire believes he’s likely won. On election night, he called it an “honor” to be the Republican nominee and echoed his stance </span><a href="https://x.com/JohnMcGuire4VA/status/1803280397561741475" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are still a few votes left to count,” he wrote. “But it’s clear that all paths end with a victory.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the most high-profile contest in Virginia — the intra-GOP brawl between incumbent Rep. Bob Good and state Sen. John McGuire — was too close to call as of 10 p.m Tuesday evening, three hours after the polls closed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Navy veteran Hung Cao won a lopsided victory in a Republican primary to take on Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine in November, several competitive House of Representatives districts saw hard-fought battles for both parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are the primary results so far:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">10th District: Subramanyam prevails </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, bested 11 other Democratic candidates to win the party’s nomination in the blue-leaning but competitive 10th District based in Northern Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, a lawyer and former White House technology advisor in the Obama administration, has served in the Virginia General Assembly since 2020. He was endorsed for the 10th District seat by incumbent Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, who is stepping down from public service after being diagnosed with a severe neurological disorder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The runner-up in the Democratic contest was Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax. Former Virginia Education Secretary Atif Qarni finished in third place, followed by former House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn in fourth and Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, in fifth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Republican contest, attorney and technology executive Mike Clancy easily defeated three other GOP contenders. Clancy will likely face an uphill battle in a district Wexton won by 6 percentage points in 2022.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">7th District: Vindman’s victory</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman, a military officer who rose to national fame by helping his twin brother blow the whistle on former President Donald Trump’s conduct in office, won the Democratic nomination for the competitive 7th District seat being vacated by Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vindman’s anti-Trump profile helped him crush his Democratic rivals in fundraising and helped him win around 50% of the vote in a seven-person primary. Early results showed Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William, finishing second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Green Beret turned lawyer Derrick Anderson won the GOP nomination in the district, defeating fellow military veteran Cameron Hamilton. Four other Republican candidates were in the running, but the results reflected what was essentially a two-person race between Anderson and Hamilton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger is running for governor in 2025 instead of seeking reelection to Congress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based largely in Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford counties, the district also covers rural bits of central Virginia and has been seen as in play for Republicans as they seek to hold their majority in the House. In 2022, Spanberger defended her seat by 4.6 percentage points against Prince William supervisor Yesli Vega. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2nd District: Smasal wins, will take on Kiggans</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in Virginia Beach, a Democratic primary set the stage for a general election that will likely draw national attention. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee-backed Navy veteran Missy Cotter Smasal topped Democratic challenger attorney Jake Denton. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denton trailed in fundraising, as Cotter Smasal had notched big endorsements from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries — who stands likely to become Speaker of the House if Democrats regain that chamber — along with all six of Virginia’s Democratic representatives and former governors Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incumbent Rep. Jenn Kiggans’ seat is among vulnerable Republicans that Democratic national groups are targeting ahead of November for potential to flip. Kiggans is a Navy veteran and nurse who previously served in Virginia’s state senate. She defeated fellow Navy veteran Elaine Luria in 2022 by 3.4 percentage points. The Virginia Beach-anchored district has oscillated between Democratic and Republican control over the years and is expected to be very competitive for both women by November. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">1st District: Mehta succeeds</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney Leslie Mehta, who formerly worked for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, handily beat former New Kent County treasurer Herb Jones in a two-way Democratic primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’ll now take on Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, in a Republican-leaning district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta received a high-profile endorsement from Spanberger in the primary.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">5th District: Good v. McGuire, too close to call </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of the 5th District congressional primary contest weren’t solidified hours after voting ended, with Good and McGuire each pulling nearly 50% of all counted ballots Tuesday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s largest congressional district attracted a national audience as GOP heavyweights campaigned with both men. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On election eve, once-and-possibly-future president Donald Trump had a virtual rally for McGuire, while Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga stumped for McGuire at multiple events and posted videos on social media in the weeks leading up to the election.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ibqwUuuoKW"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/marjorie-taylor-green-calls-bob-good-a-liar-and-john-mcguire-a-loyalist-at-rally/">Marjorie Taylor Greene calls Bob Good a ‘liar’ and John McGuire a ‘loyalist’ at rally</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Marjorie Taylor Greene calls Bob Good a ‘liar’ and John McGuire a ‘loyalist’ at rally&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/marjorie-taylor-green-calls-bob-good-a-liar-and-john-mcguire-a-loyalist-at-rally/embed/#?secret=G7dMLgfeqf#?secret=ibqwUuuoKW" data-secret="ibqwUuuoKW" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Good had reinforcements from Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Texas congressman Chip Roy. Good was also joined by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon (weeks before he’s </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/steve-bannon-contempt-jan-6-committee-prison-2da50bcf2f8ff8f3e01ef4bf2b1b845e#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">due in federal prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for denying a subpoena related to a congressional investigation into the U.S. Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a June 7 event in Powhatan, Bannon said “prison is not gonna be that bad” and compared his upcoming sentence to his Navy service. “It’s just serving my country in a different way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also praised Good for his service as an elected official and chair of the House Freedom Caucus, congress’ most conservative group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he had a high profile former Trump strategist backing him, he lacked the support of Trump himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though both candidates share conservative Republican policy stances and have expressed admiration for Trump, it’s Good’s brief endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis that has haunted him. Trump’s team also sent a cease and desist letter to Good’s campaign for using signs with his name that implied an endorsement he doesn’t have. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s congressional primaries Tuesday, Republicans will be picking a nominee to run against U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, while Democrats will be picking would-be successors for two Northern Virginia congresswomen who aren’t running for reelection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent polls have pointed to a close presidential race in Virginia between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Those early polls indicate there could be several hard-fought congressional contests further down the ballot, particularly in three suburban districts — the 2nd, the 7th and the 10th — that Democrats and Republicans battled over in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s primaries will set the table for those races and settle a hard-right grudge match between warring MAGA factions in central Virginia’s Republican-leaning 5th District.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what to watch on primary night:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A referendum on Rep. Bob Good</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Incumbent Rep. Bob Good, R-Va., is facing primary challenger Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, in a contest that’s been attracting national attention. In a safe Republican district, the winner of this week’s GOP primary will be a strong favorite to win the seat in the fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good is a two-term congressman first elected in 2020. He spent nearly 20 years working in finance before becoming an associate director in Liberty University’s athletics department. He also served as a member of Campbell County’s board of supervisors and led efforts to declare it a &#8220;Second Amendment Sanctuary&#8221; in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who declared his candidacy against Good days after being elected to the state senate, has previously run for the 7th Congressional District and spent three terms in Virginia&#8217;s House of Delegates. He’s a former Navy SEAL and owns a physical training business. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both men have traveled around the 5th district — which sprawls from Albemarle County westward towards Richmond and down to Danville near the North Carolina border — connecting with voters. Sometimes they’ve been flanked by high-profile Republicans in the national spotlight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/05/marjorie-taylor-green-calls-bob-good-a-liar-and-john-mcguire-a-loyalist-at-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined McGuire at a few events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the district and posted videos of her support for him on social media. Former President Donald Trump has also endorsed McGuire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist, headlined an event for Good recently. Texas congressman Chip Roy and Florida congressman Matt Gaetz have also joined Good on the campaign trail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While each candidate shares similar stances on several conservative Republican issues, it’s Trump’s backing that is a litmus test in the race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Good has been a longtime cheerleader of the once-and-possibly-future president, his brief endorsement of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last summer before he dropped out of the race has haunted him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s campaign has since endorsed McGuire and sent a cease and desist letter to Good’s campaign for signs that include Trump’s name that imply an endorsement he doesn’t have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, meanwhile, attended January’s Iowa caucuses to support Trump — and missed some presentations and votes during this year’s General Assembly session to do so. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Good and his allies assert McGuire doesn’t have what it takes to serve on the House Freedom Caucus — Congress’ most conservative group that Good chairs — McGuire and his allies call Good a “liar” who is a “Republican In Name Only.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A scramble to replace two departing Northern Virginia congresswomen</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being diagnosed with a severe and incurable brain disorder, incumbent U.S. Rep Jennifer Wexton announced she wouldn’t run again for the 10th District seat she first won in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her eyes on Virginia’s 2025 race for governor, U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger also isn’t running for another term in the neighboring 7th District.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That left two competitive Northern Virginia districts without incumbents and set off a surge of candidates hoping to succeed Wexton and Spanberger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 10th District — based mostly in Loudoun, Prince William and Fauquier counties — the biggest names in a field of a dozen Democratic primary contenders are Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, Del. Dan Helmer, Sen. Jennifer Boysko and former House of Delegates Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wexton, who defeated a well-funded Republican challenger by more than six percentage points in 2022, has endorsed Subramanyam for the seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in the Democratic mix are Del. David Reid, Del. Michelle Maldonado and former Virginia Secretary of Education Atif Qarni, who served under former Gov. Ralph Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The winner of the 10th District Democratic primary will face whomever emerges victorious from a four-person Republican primary happening Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP field in the 10th includes attorney and technology executive Mike Clancy, Marine Corps veteran and former Youngkin administration official Aliscia Andrews, retired military officer Alex Isaac and defense contractor Manga Anantatmula.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 7th District, seven Democrats and six Republicans are competing for the chance to replace Spanberger, who’s currently the only candidate from either party actively running a 2025 gubernatorial campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top Republican contenders in the 7th are Derrick Anderson, a former Green Beret turned lawyer who worked in the Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Trump administration, and Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL who more recently worked at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Despite their remarkably similar profiles, Anderson and Hamilton have </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/08/virginia-7th-district-anderson-hamilton-ads/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">traded blows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over who gives the GOP the best chance to flip a seat that’s winnable for the party under the right conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats in the district are facing a choice between experience in state and local politics and national star power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eugene Vindman — a career military officer who rose to fame during the Trump era when he and his twin brother, Alex Vindman, raised alarms about a phone call Trump made to Ukrainian officials — has raised more than $5 million to run in the district as a Democrat. His fundraising has dwarfed the other six Democratic candidates he’s competing against, many of whom have longer backgrounds in Virginia politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competing against Vindman are Dels. Elizabeth Guzman and Briana Sewell, as well as Prince William county supervisors Margaret Angela Franklin and Andrea Bailey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 7th District, based largely in Prince William, Spotsylvania and Stafford counties, covers a big enough swath of rural central Virginia that it’s seen as more competitive for the GOP than the 10th. In 2022, Spanberger defeated Prince William supervisor Yesli Vega by 4.6 percentage points. </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine has a long history in electoral politics, serving in local, state and federal office before being tapped as Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential running mate in 2016. Facing challengers is nothing new for Kaine, but running for office is new to some of his five would-be challengers competing in the Republican U.S. Senate primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While they overlap on various policy stances, it’s the resume and personal flair of the GOP candidates that make each stand out for different reasons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After challenging Wexton in 2022 and coming up short, Navy veteran Hung Cao appears to be a top contender in the GOP’s crowded U.S. Senate primary after winning Trump’s endorsement. Cao’s political action committee, Unleash America, has come under scrutiny for </span><a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/15/pac-built-to-help-va-candidates-across-the-finish-line-left-many-confused-where-the-money-went/73264487007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not supporting other Republican candidates as he’d initially announced the PAC was created to do.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis staffer Scott Parkinson also has a fundraising background as a senior official at the Club For Growth political action committee. Additionally, he’s worked for various representatives on Capitol Hill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyer and Navy veteran Chuck Smith has mounted unsuccessful campaigns to include Virginia Beach city council and a run for attorney general. He also spent time as the local chair of Virginia Beach’s Republican Party chapter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawyer Jonathan Emord </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/nyregion/alex-jones-coronavirus-cure.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">represented Alex Jones when the conspiratorial radio host was ordered to stop selling products that claimed to cure COVID-19</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Previously, he worked for the Federal Communications Commission during President Ronald Reagan’s term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eddie Garcia touts his background as the “son of a ranch hand” in Texas who went on to serve in the Army for over 20 years and be a congressional liaison for the Army. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The candidates share a desire to “retire” Kaine from office and overlap on many policy stances — such as being fiscally conservative and supporting tighter security at the U.S &#8211; Mexico border. They dislike abortion and some refer to themselves as “pro-life,” but several have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/17/they-dont-like-abortion-but-kaines-gop-challengers-say-they-wont-seek-a-federal-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said they won’t implement a national ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the procedure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cook Political Report </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranks </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine’s senate seat as a “Solid D” — meaning he would likely be able to fend off whoever emerges from the primary when they face him in November. But given the polls showing a close presidential race in Virginia, a stronger showing of Trump voters in November could translate to higher support for whomever Republicans pick to run against Kaine.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic leaders look to lock in pick against Kiggans</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she prepares to defend the Hampton Roads-based 2nd District for the first time, Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, is considered a top target for Democrats who want to flip back a seat they lost in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is backing Missy Cotter Smasal, a Navy veteran who now serves as the executive director of a veteran-focused nonprofit. The DCCC named  Smasal to its “Red to Blue” program, which focuses resources on districts where Democrats have the greatest chance to knock off a Republican incumbent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smasal is facing competition in a Democratic primary from Jake Denton, an attorney who focuses on civil rights and constitutional law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Denton trails in fundraising, and  Smasal has notched big endorsements from U.S. House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, all six of Virginia’s Democratic representatives in the U.S. House and former Govs. Ralph Northam and Terry McAuliffe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiggans, a former state senator and Navy veteran herself, defeated former congresswoman Elaine Luria two years ago by 3.4 percentage points. The district has alternated between Democratic and Republican representatives over the years. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A Democratic primary with a Unite the Right angle</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1st District, two Democrats competing in a primary have been sparring over</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/23/an-aclu-lawyer-defended-racists-free-speech-rights-now-shes-running-for-congress/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the violent Unite the Right rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that took place in Charlottesville during the summer of 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney Leslie Mehta — seen as the frontrunner to win the Democratic nomination against GOP Rep. Rob Wittman — worked for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia when the organization lent legal representation to Unite the Right organizers as they battled Charlottesville officials over the terms of a rally permit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal judge sided with the ACLU, ruling that the city didn’t have a legal basis to move the rally to a more distant location and allowed the rally to proceed in a park in the heart of the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehta, endorsed in the primary by Spanberger and other prominent elected Democrats, says she and the ACLU stood up for the principle that people should be free to peacefully express unpopular political beliefs without government interference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her primary opponent, former New Kent County treasurer Herb Jones, has argued she and the ACLU should have been more clear-eyed about threats of violence that day and has warned Democrats against nominating someone with a connection to the infamous event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district represented by Wittman leans Republican and runs from the Richmond suburbs to the Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula and outskirts of Hampton Roads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this stage in her career, the chapter of being a medical resident is naturally coming to a close and she will move on to become an attending physician in Rhode Island. Resil has spent the past three years at Johnston Memorial Hospital in Abingdon, in Southwest Virginia. She’s excited that she’ll be closer to her family in Boston and nearer to metropolitan areas, though practicing family medicine in a rural area was attractive to her as a medical resident. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Family medicine practice can include obstetrics — the delivery of babies — and the exodus of doctors like Resil comes at a time where several rural hospitals in Virginia have suspended their obstetrics programs. Within the past year, Sentara Halifax Regional Hospital, Sovah Health in Martinsville and LewisGale Hospital-Montgomery in Blacksburg have stopped offering obstetrics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentara</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Halifax Regional Hospital Dr. Brian Zwoyer said that there was a 33% decrease in births there over the past five years. In a recent email, he attributed this to “changing demographics, aging populations and a national declining birth rate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With hospitals already less accessible in rural areas of the state than urban areas, Resil noted that patients end up traveling further for check-up appointments or to give birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And as you get closer to your due date, you have more appointments,” Resil said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 15% of people in Virginia </span><a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/reports/virginia/maternity-care-deserts" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t have a birthing hospital within a 30-minute drive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to a report from the March of Dimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danville-based doula Roshay Richardson works with clients around Virginia’s South Side and occasionally some from North Carolina. She said that she’s seen patients travel to Danville from elsewhere to give birth and wonders how much of a strain that could put on labor and delivery doctors with an uptick in clients. Richardson works with the Virginia Rural Health Association, which advocates to lawmakers about rural healthcare needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While doulas aren’t obstetricians, they provide companionship and patient advocacy to their clients. A U.S. Department of Health </span><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/dfcd768f1caf6fabf3d281f762e8d068/ASPE-Doula-Issue-Brief-12-13-22.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted doulas’ role in positive health outcomes and they’ve been particularly helpful for Black parents. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Resil described a patient traveling about three hours because they wanted to see a doctor of color. Resil is among a diverse cohort of medical residents in a</span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/virginia-population-change-between-census-decade.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> predominantly white part of the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They were a little bit scared because they had providers that were white in the past and they felt uncomfortable because they felt like they weren’t being heard,” Resil said of the patient.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a woman of color with family from Haiti, Resil knows this feeling. She shared that anecdotally, she and members of her family have felt this way when they’ve gone to the doctor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then seeing that in some of my patients. They’ve been hopping around from doctor to doctor saying ‘something is wrong but I can’t figure it out; but no one is listening to me,” Resil said. “And then we find out, ‘oh yeah, there is. Let’s make sure we get you to the high-risk OB-GYN.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OB-GYN care can be deadly at times, with pregnancy-related medical emergencies that can arise suddenly. Such was the case for Wendy Welch’s friend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welch, director of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southwest Virginia Graduate Medical Education Consortium, described how a friend developed eclampsia. The pregnancy-related blood pressure disorder is life threatening and her friend had to be flown to a different hospital across the state line and into an urban area. This saved her life, but also resulted in much higher medical bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She explained that her friend was unconscious when loaded onto a flight and then “woke up about $30,000 in debt.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A funding boost</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money is both an issue and a solution, Welch explained. Her nonprofit organization works to help cover costs of bringing medical residents into Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welch said that lower population density and declining birth rates has meant there’s not “enough people for the hospital system to consider (obstetrics) profitable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But funding positions could help. Most OB-GYN residencies </span><a href="https://www.acog.org/career-support/medical-students/medical-student-toolkit/ob-gyn-residencies-by-state" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are in other areas of the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Though family medicine residents can work with pregnant clients, OB-GYN residents are more specialized in obstetrics and gynecology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Rural areas) get screwed,” Welch said. “To catch a unicorn — to catch someone who’s that valuable and knows they’re that valuable, you need a whole lot of stuff to attract them now. If they’re a kayaker or their mom is in Southwest Virginia, you’ve got them, but if not, how are you going to get them here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers have secured </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2024/1/HB30/Enrolled/1/288/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">funding in the state budget </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that they hope can bolster medical residencies. Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery and Del. Jason Ballard, R-Giles pressed for one million over the next two years to fund 10 obstetric-gynecological residents. Two positions are specifically earmarked for Johnston Memorial, where Resil has worked in family medicine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The matter is also personal to Obenshain, whose wife had to travel to give birth to their child recently when the LewisGale hospital near them stopped labor and delivery services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He felt lucky that there is a cluster of hospitals in his portion of Southwest Virginia, but he noted how other parts of Southwest Virginia and South Side have less options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s a much bigger issue when a hospital doesn&#8217;t provide these services anymore,” Obenshain said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Maternal health legislation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia legislators in both parties worked on a variety of bills this year to improve maternal health outcomes. Some proposals, like a requirement for health insurance </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coverage of doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, were signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, he vetoed a proposal to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">include unconscious bias and cultural competency training when renewing medical licenses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black people are more likely to experience</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> negative maternal health outcomes, in part, due to providers’ racial bias,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> according to a study. </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black women are also more likely to die from pregnancy complications than white women</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women whose skin is darker than my wife’s skin have significantly worse outcomes,” Sen. Chris Head, R-Botetourt, said during a floor speech while defending the bill in the Senate. “Something needs to be examined and done about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head had carried the bill with three Democratic  lawmakers who are also Black women: Sens. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg; Mamie Locke, D-Hampton; and Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though he ultimately vetoed the bill, Youngkin had first sought amendments that advocates for the bill worried made the training just a “checked box.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin signaled interest in working on more maternal health legislation so the bill could come up again next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, new cohorts of medical residents will cycle through Virginia and state agencies are set to use the new budget funding to recruit some with OB-GYN specialties. </span></p>
