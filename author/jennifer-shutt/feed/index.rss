(Photo by Getty Images).</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate approved a broadly bipartisan bill early Saturday that would increase Social Security benefits for millions of Americans with pensions by ending two of the program’s policies in place for decades — the windfall elimination provision and government pension offset.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The legislation, which would cost more than $195 billion over 10 years, now goes to President Joe Biden for his signature. While he hasn’t released a public endorsement of the bill, extensive support in the House and Senate could signal he’s likely to support the measure becoming law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Senate vote was <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00338.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76-20</a> and the <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House vote</a> in November was 327-75.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said during floor debate Wednesday that a fix for the two provisions has been decades in the making, noting she held the first hearing on the issue in the upper chamber in 2003.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Collins later partnered with the late California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein to introduce the first version of the bill in 2005, before working with former Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski in 2007 on another version.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Social Security is the foundation of retirement income for most Americans, yet many teachers, firefighters, police officers and other public servants often see their earned Social Security benefits unfairly reduced by two provisions,” Collins said. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The windfall elimination provision, she said, “affects public servants who receive a pension from a job not covered by Social Security, but who also worked long enough in another job to qualify for Social Security benefits.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The government pension offset affects people who worked in jobs that weren’t eligible for Social Security, but were eligible for a spousal benefit. That pension offset, Collins said, can reduce a spouse’s Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the non-covered pension, leading to 70% of those affected by the GPO to lose the entire Social Security benefit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This issue is extraordinarily important in my state of Maine because the state’s pension system does not include a Social Security component,” Collins said. “And among those most affected are Maine school teachers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Collins called the WEP and the GPO “an unfair, inequitable penalty.” </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Hit to trust fund</h4>
<p dir="ltr">North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said the bill’s title made it sound like “motherhood and apple pie,” but argued it wasn’t the right approach to address the problem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He expressed concern the bill would reduce the Social Security trust fund by an additional $200 billion during the next decade, moving up the insolvency date by six months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This chamber needs courage and needs to say what needs to be said — we are about to pass an unfunded $200 billion spending package for a trust fund that is likely to go insolvent over the next nine to ten years and we’re going to pretend like somebody else has to fix it,” Tillis said. “Well, when you’re a U.S. senator and you have your election certificate, that falls on us.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tillis said he agreed with Collins and others who support the bill that the WEP and the GPO must be fixed, but said that should be part of a larger conversation about addressing Social Security’s upcoming insolvency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We do not disagree with what we ultimately need to do,” Tillis said. “This is a disagreement in how to get here and how to have something that assesses the downstream risk. So it is with some trepidation that I come to the floor and criticize the good work of Sen. Collins. But I do it because there is so much riding on us getting this right and having the courage to fix Social Security over the next few years.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said during floor debate Wednesday that people who paid into Social Security for the required amount of time should receive their full benefits. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“Social Security we know is a bedrock of our middle class — it’s retirement security that Americans pay into and earn over a lifetime,” Brown said. “You pay in for 40 quarters, you pay in essentially for 10 years. You’ve earned it. It should be there when you retire.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown said it “makes no sense” that workers in certain public service jobs, like teachers, police officers and firefighters, cannot draw their full benefits. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“They protect our communities, they teach our kids, they pay into Social Security just like everyone else,” Brown said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">How do these provisions work?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The pension offset reduces a “spousal or widow(er)’s benefits of most people who also receive pensions based on federal, state, or local government employment not covered by Social Security,” according to a <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The windfall elimination provision changes the formula to reduce Social Security benefits for people “who are also entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from jobs that were not covered by Social Security,” the report said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pension offset affects about 746,000 Americans while the windfall provision affects 2.1 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The share of Social Security beneficiaries affected by the GPO varies widely by state,” the CRS report says. “States with a relatively larger share of GPO-affected beneficiaries are usually those with a larger share of state and local government employees not covered by Social Security or those with more (Civil Service Retirement System) retirees.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pension offset has a disproportionate impact on Social Security beneficiaries in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas and Utah. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The windfall elimination provision affects a larger percentage of residents in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington, Wyoming. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“Similar to the GPO, the share of Social Security beneficiaries affected by the WEP varies by state,” CRS wrote. “Typically, states that have a larger share of state and local government employees not covered by Social Security or more CSRS retirees have a relatively larger share of Social Security beneficiaries affected by the WEP.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Bipartisan House support</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The U.S. House <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted 327-75</a> in November to approve the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/82/text?s=1&#038;r=1&#038;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22social+security+fairness+act%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four-page bill,</a> sponsored by Louisiana Republican Rep. Garret Graves and Virginia Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Graves said during <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/crec/2024/11/12/170/166/CREC-2024-11-12-house.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor debate</a> that for 40 years, Social Security worked by “treating people differently, discriminating against a certain set of workers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These are police officers, teachers, firefighters, and other public servants,” Graves said at the time. “I worked side by side with these folks. They are not people who are overpaid. They are not people who are underworked.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spanberger called the windfall elimination provision and the government pension offset “two misguided provisions that were added to the Social Security Act in 1983 (and) have denied Americans the retirement security they worked for and expected to receive.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For more than 40 years, public servants have tirelessly implored their representatives in Congress to listen to their stories and to correct this glaring injustice,” Spanberger said. “Today, for the first time, Congress will vote on the Social Security Fairness Act, to repeal the WEP and the GPO, and to finally put an end to this theft.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Opposition to bill</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Missouri Republican Rep. Jason Smith, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the two provisions affect around 4% of all Social Security beneficiaries, more than 60% of whom are concentrated in 10 states.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two provisions, he said, “were put in place more than four decades ago to prevent workers with earnings that were exempt from Social Security payroll taxes from getting more generous treatment from Social Security than workers who spent their whole careers contributing to Social Security.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Unfortunately, these policies still result in overly generous benefits for some while unfairly penalizing others,” Smith said, before arguing the bill wasn’t the right way to address the two provisions. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Smith said that getting rid of the two provisions “without a replacement potentially trades unfair treatment for preferential treatment.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He also expressed concern about how pulling more money from the Social Security trust fund would impact solvency. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60690" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> the bill would cost $195.65 billion during the next 10 years and wrote in a <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-11/60876-HR82.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a> to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley that it would likely move up the Social Security insolvency date by six months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If H.R. 82 was enacted, the balance of the (Old-Age and Survivors Insurance) trust fund would, CBO projects, be exhausted roughly half a year earlier than it would be under current law,” CBO Director Phillip L. Swagel wrote. “The agency estimates that under current law, the balance of the OASI trust fund would be exhausted during fiscal year 2033.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Social Security<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> trustees report</a> for 2024 says that the program will be able to pay full benefits until 2035. After that, if Congress hasn’t brokered a solution, Social Security would be able to pay about 83% of benefits. </p>

Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks to members of the press at the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 20, 2024 in Washington, D.C.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Congress finally approved a stopgap spending bill&nbsp;early Saturday that will keep the government open for a few more months, after a raucous 48 hours that served as a preview of what President-elect Donald Trump’s second term in office might look like.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The short-term spending package, the third version of a bill to be released this week, will give lawmakers until mid-March to negotiate agreement on the dozen full-year government funding measures and provide about $100 billion in natural disaster assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although it technically was passed by the Senate after the midnight deadline for a shutdown, deputy White House press secretary Emilie Simons <a href="https://x.com/EmilieSimons46/status/1870332808813764703" target="_blank">said on X </a>that agencies would continue normal operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The House passed the bill Friday evening following a&nbsp;<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024517" target="_blank">366-34 vote</a> with one Democrat voting “present.” The Senate voted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00339.htm" target="_blank">85-11</a> shortly after midnight Saturday. President Joe Biden signed the bill Saturday morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The legislation did not include any language either raising or suspending the debt limit, rejecting a demand by Trump that it be addressed. Congress and Trump will have to deal with that next year when they control the House, Senate and the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20241216/ARA%2012.20.pdf" target="_blank">118-page bill&nbsp;</a>will extend programs in the five-year farm bill through September, giving the House and Senate more time to broker a deal, even though they are already more than a year late.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The package would not block members of Congress from their first cost-of-living salary adjustment since January 2009, boosting lawmakers’ pay next year from $174,000 to a maximum of $180,600.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It does not include a provision considered earlier this week that would have allowed the year-round sale of E15 blended gasoline nationwide in what would have been a win for corn growers and biofuels.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The White House announced during the House vote that Biden supports the legislation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“While it does not include everything we sought, it includes disaster relief that the President requested for the communities recovering from the storm, eliminates the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires, and would ensure that the government can continue to operate at full capacity,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wrote. “President Biden supports moving this legislation forward and ensuring that the vital services the government provides for hardworking Americans – from issuing Social Security checks to processing benefits for veterans &#8212; can continue as well as to grant assistance for communities that were impacted by devastating hurricanes.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Appropriators at odds</h4>
<p dir="ltr">House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., urged support for the bill during floor debate, saying it would avoid a partial government shutdown, provide disaster aid and send economic assistance to farmers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Governing by continuing resolution is never ideal, but Congress has a responsibility to keep the government open and operating for the American people,” Cole said. “The alternative, a government shutdown, would be devastating to our national defense and for our constituents and would be a grave mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Connecticut Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, spoke against the bill and criticized GOP negotiators from walking away from the original, bipartisan version released Tuesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She rejected billionaire Elon Musk, a close Trump ally, seemingly calling the shots as if he were an elected lawmaker, though she ultimately voted for passage.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The United States Congress has been thrown into pandemonium,” DeLauro said. “It leads you to the question of who is in charge?”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Trump, Musk objections</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Democrats and Republicans reached<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/huge-spending-bill-unveiled-congress-provides-more-100-billion-disaster-aid" target="_blank"> an agreement earlier this week</a> to fund the government, provide disaster aid, extend the agriculture and nutrition programs in the farm bill, extend various health care programs and complete dozens of other items. But Trump intervened, preventing House GOP leaders from putting that bill on the floor for an up-or-down vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump and Musk&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/chances-government-shutdown-escalate-after-trump-and-gop-reject-stopgap-spending-bill" target="_blank">were unsupportive of some of the extraneous provisions in the original bill&nbsp;</a>and Trump began pressing for lawmakers to address the debt limit now rather than during his second term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">House Republicans&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-torpedoes-new-spending-plan-government-shutdown-nears-friday-night" target="_blank">tried to pass their first GOP-only stopgap bill&nbsp;</a>on Thursday night, but failed following a 174-235 vote, with 38 GOP lawmakers voting against the bill. That bill included a two-year debt limit suspension, but that was dropped from the version passed Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Friday before the vote that the GOP was united on its plan forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have a unified Republican Conference. There is a unanimous agreement in the room that we need to move forward,” Johnson said following a 90-minute closed-door meeting. “I expect that we will be proceeding forward. We will not have a government shutdown. And we will meet our obligations for our farmers, for the disaster victims all over the country, and for marking sure the military and essential services and everyone who relies on the federal government for a paycheck is paid over the holidays.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A total of 34 House Republicans voted against the bill. No House Democrats voted against passage.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">No shutdown, for now</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The House and Senate not agreeing on some sort of stopgap spending bill before the Friday midnight deadline would have led to a funding lapse that would likely have led to a partial government shutdown just as the holidays begin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During a shutdown, essential government functions that cover the protection of life and property continue, though no federal workers would have received their paychecks until after the shutdown ends. That loss of income would have extended to U.S. troops as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If there is going to be a shutdown of government, let it begin now, under the Biden Administration, not after January 20th, under “TRUMP,” the president-elect posted on social media Friday morning. “This is a Biden problem to solve, but if Republicans can help solve it, they will!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a separate post that went up just after 1 a.m. Eastern, Trump doubled down on his insistence that any short-term spending bill suspend the debt limit for another four years or eliminate the borrowing ceiling entirely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Congress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling,” Trump wrote. “Without this, we should never make a deal. Remember, the pressure is on whoever is President.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">That short-term spending bill, or some version of it, must become law before Friday at midnight, otherwise a partial government shutdown would begin. A partial shutdown would halt paychecks to federal employees and U.S. troops just ahead of the holiday season.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/CR2%20State%20by%20State_0.pdf" target="_blank">breakdown</a> shows states battered by hurricanes and other natural disasters such as California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia would miss out on more than $2 billion each, though the figures for the larger states go above $10 billion.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Misinformation over pay raise</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/chances-government-shutdown-escalate-after-trump-and-gop-reject-stopgap-spending-bill" target="_blank">stalemate over the short-term spending bill</a> began shortly after congressional leaders&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/huge-spending-bill-unveiled-congress-provides-more-100-billion-disaster-aid" target="_blank">released the 1,547-page package&nbsp;</a>on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaker Mike Johnson defended some of the extraneous measures during a press conference Tuesday before it was publicly released and during a Fox News interview Wednesday morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Louisiana Republican reinforced the need for disaster aid and economic assistance to farmers, though the spending package includes dozens of unrelated items, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/win-biofuels-stopgap-spending-bill-allows-year-round-sales-e15-gas-nationwide" target="_blank">a provision that would allow the nationwide sale of 15% ethanol blended gasoline</a> year round.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/members-congress-rolled-pay-raise-themselves-big-must-do-spending-bill" target="_blank">dropped a long-standing provision that blocked members of Congress from getting an annual cost of living adjustment&nbsp;</a>salary increase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There was considerable misinformation Wednesday around how much of a boost in pay lawmakers would stand to receive next Congress, riling up people who didn’t have access to the correct figures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The incorrect numbers were spread by many online, but received special attention from Musk, who&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1869461048828522999" target="_blank">advocated shutting down the government&nbsp;</a>before Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1869495076604227726" target="_blank">weighed in</a> later Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers would receive a maximum 3.8% salary increase, boosting their annual pay from $174,000 to $180,600, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/97-1011" target="_blank">report</a> released in September by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Lawmakers haven’t received a COLA increase since January 2009.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Sudden debt limit demand</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The full package, which congressional leaders and committees spent weeks negotiating, would have given Congress until March 14 to negotiate a bicameral agreement on the dozen annual government funding bills that were supposed to become law by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans wanted to hold over the full-year spending bills until they have unified control of government next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The package would have given lawmakers until Sept. 30 to work out a deal on the five-year farm bill, which they should have completed work on well over a year ago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump pressed Wednesday for lawmakers to add the debt limit to negotiations, with just about two days left before the shutdown deadline. Working out a bipartisan agreement to raise or suspend the nation’s borrowing authority typically takes months of talks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he didn’t want to have to deal with the debt limit debate once his second administration begins on Jan. 20 and would rather have had it on President Joe Biden’s record.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/GarrettHaake/status/1869744357886263420" target="_blank">told NBC News on Thursday morning&nbsp;</a>that he wanted Congress to eliminate the debt limit entirely, marking a substantial shift in how Republicans have approached the cap on borrowing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The GOP typically leverages the debt ceiling debate to push for spending cuts, though not always successfully.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democratic leaders in Congress maintain they are not going to renegotiate with Republicans, which would prevent any Republican-only bill from becoming law before the deadline. While the GOP controls the House, Democrats right now run the Senate and hold the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Thursday morning in a floor speech that GOP infighting over the bipartisan bill was risking an unnecessary government shutdown.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Unfortunately, it seems Republicans are in shambles over in the House,” Schumer said. “But as they try to piece things together, they should remember one thing — the only way to get things done is through bipartisanship.&#8221;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Jeffries urges vote on stopgap</h4>
<p dir="ltr">House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., on didn’t entirely rule out lawmakers from his party voting for a slimmed-down stopgap spending bill, but urged GOP leaders to stick with the version they spent weeks negotiating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This reckless Republican-driven shutdown can be avoided if House Republicans will simply do what is right for the American people and stick with the bipartisan agreement that they themselves negotiated,&#8221; Jeffries said at a Thursday press conference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s insistence that the package address the debt limit in some way was “premature at best,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jeffries also said Democrats would not give Johnson extra votes to secure the speaker’s gavel in January, should several of his GOP colleagues refuse to vote for him during a floor vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Numerous far-right Republicans have hinted or said directly that they might not support Johnson continuing on as speaker due to their grievances over provisions in the stopgap spending bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans will have an extremely narrow House majority next year, meaning Johnson can only lose a few votes before the GOP would begin the third prolonged speaker race in just two years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy began this session of Congress in January 2023 going through 15 floor votes before he was able&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-backs-mccarthy-speaker-after-tense-and-chaotic-late-night-session-25" target="_blank">to secure the votes needed</a> to become speaker.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank"> voting to oust</a> him a little over a year ago led to several GOP speaker nominees, who were unable to get the 218 votes needed to become speaker on a floor vote or who opted to not even try.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans nominated House Majority Leader&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-nominated-us-house-gop-speaker-closed-door-meeting" target="_blank">Steve Scalise&nbsp;</a>of Louisiana, Ohio Rep.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ohios-jordan-latest-us-house-gop-nominee-speaker-after-days-turmoil" target="_blank">Jim Jordan&nbsp;</a>and Minnesota’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/emmer-nominated-us-house-speaker-drops-out-after-trump-opposition-0" target="_blank">Tom Emmer&nbsp;</a>before landing on Johnson, who was<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/mike-johnson-louisiana-elected-speaker-us-house-after-three-weeks-stalemate" target="_blank"> able to win a floor vote</a>.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Musk for speaker?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-fails-attempt-oust-house-speaker-mike-johnson" target="_blank">tried but failed to oust Johnson as speaker</a> in May, has been leading the charge to select someone else, possibly Musk. The Constitution is silent on the question of whether the speaker must be a member of the House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The establishment needs to be shattered just like it was yesterday,” Greene&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1869768295399964765" target="_blank">wrote</a> on social media. “This could be the way.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>This report has been updated with state-by-state numbers revised by U.S. House Democrats later Thursday morning.</em></p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump pledged Monday to keep the polio vaccine available throughout his presidency, but didn’t extend that protection to other vaccines, saying he expects his administration will look closely at safety — something the U.S. Food and Drug Administration already does before granting approval.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s comments came during an hour-long press conference where he hinted at trying to privatize the Postal Service and said he planned to file a lawsuit against a presidential preference poll published by The Des Moines Register that found him trailing Vice President Kamala Harris in the last days before the election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump, who will take the oath of office on Jan. 20, also said he would solve the war between Ukraine and Russia and establish the Middle East as a “good place,” though he declined to provide details.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Starting on day one, we&#8217;ll implement a rapid series of bold reforms to restore our nation to full prosperity,” Trump said in his first formal back-and-forth with reporters since the Nov. 5 election. “We&#8217;re going to go full prosperity and to build the greatest economy the world has ever seen, just as we had just a short time ago.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he expects Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the vaccine denier he has said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-taps-vaccine-skeptic-rfk-jr-lead-department-health-and-human-services" target="_blank">he will nominate&nbsp;</a>to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, will be “much less radical” than some people expect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said Kennedy and others in his administration will file reports sharing what they think about vaccines, but didn’t say what actions might be taken after those reports are released.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he didn’t like the idea of mandating vaccines, but didn’t go as far as saying he’d change vaccine policy for parts of the federal government, like the Defense Department, which has numerous requirements for troops, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.military.com/off-duty/2020/02/10/why-most-dreaded-injection-called-peanut-butter-shot.html" target="_blank">the so-called peanut butter shot.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Kennedy is notorious for spreading misinformation about vaccine safety, one of the many issues that could imperil his attempts to garner U.S. Senate confirmation and actually lead HHS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he wanted this administration to look at why autism rates have increased in recent decades.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/autism-vaccine-link-debunked" target="_blank">Multiple research studies have debunked&nbsp;</a>any connections between vaccines and autism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His administration, Trump said, would also look at ways to lower the costs of health care and prescription drugs within the United States, but he didn’t provide details.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Lawsuit threats</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump doubled down on his grievances with news organizations during the press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, saying he planned to file several lawsuits in the days and weeks ahead against people or organizations he believes have wronged him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The announcement came just days after Trump’s legal team&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/abc-trump-lawsuit-defamation-stephanopoulos-04aea8663310af39ae2a85f4c1a56d68" target="_blank">reached a settlement with ABC News</a> in which the news organization agreed to pay $15 million to Trump’s presidential library.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The suit centered on anchor George Stephanopoulos saying during an interview that a New York state jury had found Trump liable for the rape of writer E. Jean Carroll, when the jury had found him civilly liable for “sexual misconduct.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said during his press conference that he would likely file lawsuits against Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer, the news show “60 Minutes” and the Pulitzer Prize organization for awards given to the New York Times and Washington Post.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In my opinion it was fraud and election interference,” he said of the Iowa Poll published by the Des Moines newspaper. “She&#8217;s got me right, always. She&#8217;s a very good pollster. She knows what she was doing, and she then quit before and we&#8217;ll probably be filing a major lawsuit against them today or tomorrow.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Selzer, a longtime pollster, said last week on Iowa PBS that she hadn’t yet figured out what went wrong with the poll she released just ahead of Election Day that showed Democratic presidential nominee Harris outperforming Trump in the state by 3 percentage points. Trump won Iowa in the election with 56% of the vote to her 42.7%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There wasn&#8217;t anything that we saw that needed to be fixed. The reality is that more people supporting Donald Trump turned out,” she said. “I&#8217;m eagerly awaiting the secretary of state&#8217;s turnout reports that will happen in January to see what we can glean from that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But there wasn&#8217;t an adjustment to my data when we saw that it was going to be a shocker that I would have said okay, let&#8217;s adjust it. It&#8217;s not like I know ahead of time what the right numbers are going to be in the future. So, you kind of take the data designed to reveal to me our best shot at what the future is going to look like.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Selzer said during the PBS interview that she was “mystified” about allegations that she sought to interfere in the election results through the poll. Carol Hunter, executive editor of The Des Moines Register, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he also planned to sue the CBS News program “60 Minutes” over how it edited an interview with Harris that was released before the election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He said he wants to sue the Pulitzer Prize organization&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staffs-new-york-times-and-washington-post" target="_blank">for awarding&nbsp;</a>staff at The New York Times and The Washington Post the national reporting award in 2018 for their reporting on “Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I want them to take back the Pulitzer Prizes and pay big damages,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Pulitzer Prize Board&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/news/statement-pulitzer-prize-board-2" target="_blank">announced in July 2022</a> that it would not revoke the prizes in response to an inquiry from Trump and two independent reviews of the work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Both reviews were conducted by individuals with no connection to the institutions whose work was under examination, nor any connection to each other,” the board wrote. “The separate reviews converged in their conclusions: that no passages or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The 2018 Pulitzer Prizes in National Reporting stand.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Israel and Ukraine</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said during his press conference that he would address the ongoing Israel-Gaza war as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine once he takes office, but didn’t say exactly how he’d encourage those countries to end their conflicts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he believed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing a “fantastic job” and said he thinks his second administration will be able to solve longstanding issues throughout the Middle East.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think the Middle East will be in a good place,” Trump said. “I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation. I see that as more difficult.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has refused to leave the country’s borders. In the years since Russia launched a war, numerous organizations, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/un-commission-concludes-war-crimes-have-been-committed-ukraine-expresses" target="_blank">United Nations,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/11/ukraine-russian-strikes-amounting-to-war-crimes-continue-to-kill-and-injure-children/" target="_blank">Amnesty International</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/04/03/ukraine-apparent-war-crimes-russia-controlled-areas" target="_blank">Human Rights Watch</a> have all made allegations of war crimes against Russia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.state.gov/crimes-against-humanity-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">statement</a> in February 2023 that “Russia’s forces and other Russian officials have committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Russia, he wrote, had engaged in torture, rape, execution-style killings and “deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians to Russia, including children who have been forcibly separated from their families.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said during his press conference that he didn’t believe the Biden administration should have allowed Ukraine&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-ukraine-long-range-weapons-russia-52d424158182de2044ecc8bfcf011f9c" target="_blank">to shoot long-range missiles into Russia’s sovereign territory&nbsp;</a>and said he may reverse the policy once in office.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I thought it was a very stupid thing to do,” Trump said of the Biden administration’s policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the Israel-Hamas war, Trump declined to clarify exactly what he meant when he said there would be “hell to pay” if Hamas had not released the remaining hostages abducted in October 2023 before Trump took over the Oval Office. He simply added that it “would not be pleasant.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Postal Service, TikTok, primary challengers</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump left many questions about his agenda unanswered following the press conference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He declined to clarify whether he would press to privatize the U.S. Postal Service, saying only that there was “talk” about severing the agency and that his team is “looking at that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He didn’t divulge whether his administration would seek to force social media giant TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company if it wants to remain operational within the United States. TikTok on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-appeals-court-upholds-rapidly-approaching-tiktok-ban" target="_blank">an appeals court order</a> preserving a bipartisan law forcing ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, to cease operations in the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ll take a look at that,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He left open supporting Republican primary challenges against GOP senators who don’t support his nominees to lead federal departments and agencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A senator voting against one of his nominees “for political reasons or stupid reasons” would likely earn them a primary challenger, he said. But Trump added that wouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump also declined to say whether he expected Chinese leader Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration after extending an invitation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If he&#8217;d like to come, I&#8217;d love to have him, but there&#8217;s been nothing much discussed,” Trump said. “I have had discussions with him, letters, etc, etc, at a very high level. You know, we had a very good relationship until COVID. COVID didn&#8217;t end the relationship, but it was a bridge too far for me.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump then added he believes Xi is “an amazing person.”</p>

Edgar Hoover FBI Building is seen on Jan. 28, 2019 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — The decade-long endeavor to move the Federal Bureau of Investigation out of its crumbling headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., and into a new facility outside the city could face roadblocks next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">President-elect Donald Trump and some of his top allies in Congress have rebuked the federal agency that undertook the search for a new suburban location, ultimately deciding on Greenbelt, Maryland, over two other options.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once Trump is back in the Oval Office and the GOP controls both chambers of Congress, the funding stream for the General Services Administration to build the new facility could end.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republican lawmakers could also require the GSA to restart the search process, change the criteria the federal agency used to select the Greenbelt location, or simply tell the agency it must construct the new headquarters in a different location. Other options <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/briefs/wsj-ohio-congressman-wants-to-move-fbi-headquarters-to-huntsville/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floated by GOP lawmakers</a> include Alabama and somewhere inside the District of Columbia. Or they could require GSA to build the new FBI headquarters in either Springfield, Virginia, or Landover, Maryland — the other two locations considered for the new building.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the spending panel that controls GSA’s budget, told States Newsroom he believes the issue is settled, in part, because some funding has already been allocated for the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re going to work very hard to make sure we keep the program on track,” Van Hollen said. “I think there’s a consensus that the FBI’s current headquarters does not meet the security requirements, does not meet the other requirements. So, you know, from our perspective, a decision has been made and we will work hard to make sure it’s executed, implemented.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Construction funding</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Congress approved $200 million for the headquarters project this spring as part of a much larger government spending package.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond that, funding is less certain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Senate Appropriations Committee, controlled by Democrats, has proposed $375 million for construction in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4928/text?s=6&#038;r=7&#038;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22van+hollen%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this year’s GSA spending bill</a>. That measure, which includes numerous other funding proposals, received bipartisan support during a committee vote. In January, control of the Senate will flip to the GOP.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP00/20240613/117435/BILLS-118-FC-AP-FY2025-AP00-FY25FSGGFullCommitteeMark.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House version of the bill</a>, drafted by Republicans, doesn’t include any funding for a new FBI headquarters and would require the GSA to send Congress “a detailed plan and timeline to support the District of Columbia based personnel by keeping the current FBI headquarters operational or identifying another Federally owned location in the District of Columbia that can serve as the FBI headquarters building.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two chambers will likely negotiate a final, bicameral version of the bill during the first few months of next year, once the GOP holds unified control of Congress and the White House. </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Trump hotel</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said during an interview he hadn’t really thought about whether his state could become the new site for the FBI headquarters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you just go by history, Trump didn’t want to put any money into a new FBI headquarters,” Kaine said. “He didn’t want that block that the FBI is on to be cleared and opened for a hotel that might compete with his own hotel. So four years of the Trump administration was him basically doing everything he could to stop a move and to stop funds being used for the move.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Now he may not have the same financial interest that he had back then so I bet it’s hard to say.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump owned a hotel in the old Post Office building along Pennsylvania Avenue during his first term in office, but it was later sold and is now a Waldorf Astoria. The building is about one block away from the current FBI headquarters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the top Democrat on the House panel that funds the GSA, told States Newsroom there’s “no doubt” the Greenbelt location “is the best site, both in terms of security and in terms of finances.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m going to continue to push that position,” Hoyer said. “We need to get this done for the FBI, for the American people. The building is literally falling down. And the fact that we have delayed this … is testament that we’ve escalated cost, decreased security for the federal employees at FBI, and we ought to move on. And hopefully we will.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Maryland and Virginia governors’ offices declined to comment for this article. A GSA representative, speaking on background, said the agency has submitted a report to Congress that was required by <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the spending package lawmakers approved </a>in March 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">GSA, the person said, is trying to secure “resolutions” from congressional committees before it obligates funds to buy the site or begin design and construction activities. They said this is consistent with other large-scale development projects that require congressional approval. It was not clear what those resolutions would say.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Evaluation of selection process continues</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The GSA has been under review by its inspector general for how it undertook the site selection process for more than a year, one factor that could potentially complicate things during unified Republican control of Washington.</p>
<p dir="ltr">GSA acting Inspector General Robert Erickson <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/investigation-launched-site-selection-process-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched an evaluation </a>into the agency’s process in November 2023, a few weeks after GSA <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maryland-confirmed-pick-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced its decision</a> to pick the Greenbelt, Maryland, location.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That evaluation is ongoing, and the inspector general continues “to work thoroughly and expeditiously on the project,” according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner told States Newsroom in a brief interview he’s waiting to see the inspector general’s evaluation before deciding on a path forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know people thought that it might come out in the spring. It didn’t,” Warner said. “The reports we’ve got is that they’re still doing the investigating, and let’s see what that says first.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hoyer said he doesn’t expect the results of that evaluation will affect moving the FBI headquarters to Greenbelt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think everything was done absolutely as it should have been,” Hoyer said. “An argument was made by both sides in public on the merits of their sites.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Debate over process</h4>
<p dir="ltr">FBI Director Christopher Wray <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fbi-director-slams-selection-process-new-hq-maryland-while-lawmakers-squabble%C2%A0%C2%A0-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also questioned the decision</a> last year, writing in a letter to employees that he and others held “concerns about the fairness and transparency in the process,” though he wrote those “concerns are not with the decision itself but with the process.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump has announced he will name Kash Patel as head of the FBI, though Wray would have to be fired or quit first. Trump has not yet named someone to lead the GSA.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Greenbelt decision brought about some bipartisanship in Congress, with House Oversight &#038; Accountability Committee Chair James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-oversight-leader-demands-probe-political-interference-fbi-hq-move%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urging GSA to conduct a full investigation</a> into the site selection process. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The two said the most disturbing aspect to them was that then-GSA Commissioner of the Public Building Service Nina Albert “overturned the unanimous site decision of an expert panel of civil servants representing GSA and its agency client, the FBI.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Albert left that role on Oct. 13, 2023, about a month before the final decision was announced. General Services Administrator Robin Carnahan had also <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/Enclosure%201.2%20-%20N.Albert_Authorization%20Memo_7.6.21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said two years earlier </a>Albert didn’t have a conflict of interest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Congress created GSA in 1949 to increase the efficiency and economy of federal government operations — not least the procurement and use of property,” Comer and Connolly wrote in their letter. “To fulfill that mission, GSA must be fair and transparent in its operations. Its real estate dealings should consider only what is best for taxpayers and the Nation. It must set aside political or parochial interests.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Comer and Connolly added they were “deeply concerned that GSA’s choice of a new FBI headquarters site departed from those principles — and in doing so, failed to put taxpayers and the public interest first.”</p>

(Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Incoming White House budget director Russ Vought has spent much of his career learning the detailed, often convoluted mechanisms that make up the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The agency, little known outside Washington, D.C., is relatively small compared to the rest of the federal government, but it acts like a nucleus for the executive branch and holds significant power.</p>
<p dir="ltr">OMB is responsible for releasing the president’s budget request every year, but also manages much of the executive branch by overseeing departments’ performance, reviewing the vast majority of federal regulations and coordinating how the various agencies communicate with Congress. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought was deputy director, acting director and then director at OMB during Trump’s first term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before that Vought worked as vice president of Heritage Action for America, policy director for the U.S. House Republican Conference, executive director of the Republican Study Committee and a legislative assistant for former Texas Republican Sen. Phil Gramm. He has an undergraduate degree from Wheaton College and a law degree from George Washington University Law School.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following Trump’s first term in office, Vought founded the right-leaning Center for Renewing America. The group’s mission is “to renew a consensus of America as a nation under God with unique interests worthy of defending that flow from its people, institutions, and history, where individuals’ enjoyment of freedom is predicated on just laws and healthy communities.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Cutting government spending</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Vought outlined his agenda for the next four years in Project 2025, a 922-page <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document</a> from the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation that led to speculation during the presidential campaign about what Trump would seek to do without Congress, including in areas that constitutionally fall within the legislative branch, like government spending.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, repeatedly tried to tie Project 2025 to Trump and his campaign, and they sought to distance themselves from its proposals. But Trump has since nominated some of its authors or contributors to run federal departments and agencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought, in a 26-page chapter on the executive office of the president, wrote the OMB director “must ensure the appointment of a General Counsel who is respected yet creative and fearless in his or her ability to challenge legal precedents that serve to protect the status quo.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump, Vought and many others are bullish about cutting government spending, but will likely run into legal challenges if they try to spend more or considerably less than lawmakers approve in the dozen annual government funding bills. </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Budget request</h4>
<p dir="ltr">One of Vought’s most visible responsibilities will be releasing the president’s annual budget request, a sweeping document that lays out the commander-in-chief’s proposal for the federal government’s tax and spending policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president’s budget, however, is just a request since Congress has the constitutional authority to establish tax and spending policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers on Capitol Hill write the dozen annual government funding bills that account for about one-third of annual federal spending. The rest of the federal government’s spending comes from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which are classified as mandatory programs and mostly run on autopilot unless Congress approves changes and the president signs off on a new law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That separation of powers led to frustration during Trump’s first term in office and will likely do so again, since he spoke during the 2024 campaign about using “impoundment” to prevent the federal government from spending money Congress has approved.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump withheld security assistance funding from Ukraine during his first term in office, leading to one of his two impeachments and a ruling from the Government Accountability Office —a nonpartisan government watchdog — that he had violated the law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,” GAO <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-331564.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. “OMB withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The withholding was not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump spoke on the campaign trail about using “impoundment” to drastically cut government spending, but that would likely lead to lawsuits and a Supreme Court ruling. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought’s think tank, Center for Renewing America, <a href="https://americarenewing.com/the-history-of-impoundments-before-the-impoundment-control-act-of-1974/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published analysis </a>of presidents using impoundment throughout the country’s history, with the authors concluding the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">‘Every possible tool’</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Vought sought to defend the president’s budget request in his chapter in Project 2025, writing that though “some mistakenly regard it as a mere paper-pushing exercise, the President’s budget is in fact a powerful mechanism for setting and enforcing public policy at federal agencies.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He signaled the second Trump administration would be more nuanced in its interpretation of presidential authority.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The President should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government.” Vought wrote. “Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought also wrote about the management aspect of OMB’s portfolio, pressing for political appointees to have more authority and influence than career staff.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is vital that the Director and his political staff, not the careerists, drive these offices in pursuit of the President’s actual priorities and not let them set their own agenda based on the wishes of the sprawling ‘good government’ management community in and outside of government,” Vought wrote. “Many Directors do not properly prioritize the management portfolio, leaving it to the Deputy for Management, but such neglect creates purposeless bureaucracy that impedes a President’s agenda—an ‘M Train to Nowhere.’”</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dr. Jay Bhattacharya will require Senate confirmation before taking over the role officially, but assuming he can secure the votes next year when the chamber is controlled by Republicans, he’ll have significant sway over where the federal government directs billions in research dollars.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Dr. Bhattacharya will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to direct the Nation’s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives,” Trump wrote in the announcement. Kennedy is Trump’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-taps-vaccine-skeptic-rfk-jr-lead-department-health-and-human-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pick to lead</a> the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya <a href="https://x.com/DrJBhattacharya/status/1861586856590320071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on social media</a> that he was “honored and humbled” by the nomination and pledged to “reform American scientific institutions so that they are worthy of trust again and will deploy the fruits of excellent science to make America healthy again!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to Kennedy, other Trump nominees for health-related positions include former TV personality and onetime Pennsylvania U.S. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-picks-dr-oz-run-mammoth-centers-medicare-and-medicaid-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to lead</a> the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, former Florida Congressman Dave Weldon <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-unveils-his-lineup-fda-cdc-and-surgeon-general" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to run</a> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Marty Makary for commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and Fox News medical contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat as the next surgeon general.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Together, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America’s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease,” Trump wrote in his announcement.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Health economist</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya received his undergraduate degree from Stanford University in 1990 before earning his medical degree from its School of Medicine in 1997 and a Ph.D. from the university’s Economics Department in 2000.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He focuses his research on health economics and outcomes, according to <a href="https://fsi9-prod.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/cv-jay-march2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his curriculum vitae</a>, the academic version of a resume.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya’s <a href="https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/jay_bhattacharya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biography</a> on Stanford’s website says that in addition to being a professor of health policy, he runs its Center for Demography and Economics of Health and Aging, in addition to working as a research associate at the National Bureau of Economics Research.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Dr. Bhattacharya’s research focuses on the health and well-being of vulnerable populations, with a particular emphasis on the role of government programs, biomedical innovation, and economics,” according to the biography. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Among his research areas is the “epidemiology of COVID-19 as well as an evaluation of policy responses to the epidemic.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">‘A fringe component’</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/roundtable/preparing-for-the-future-by-learning-from-the-past-examining-covid-policy-decisions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified</a> before the U.S. House Oversight Committee’s Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic in February 2023 that he believed there was “near universal agreement that what we did failed.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Official counts attribute more than one million deaths in the United States and seven million worldwide,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bhattacharya was one of three authors of The Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020, arguing that younger, healthy people should have gone about their normal lives in an effort to contract COVID-19, since they were somewhat less likely to die than at-risk populations. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The brief declaration says that “(a)dopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19.” But it doesn’t list what those measures should include and never brings up masking, physical distancing, or vaccination.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Several public health officials and researchers rejected the declaration, noting that it didn’t cite any research, data or peer-reviewed articles.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former NIH Director Francis S. Collins, who ran the agency from 2009 through 2021, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/covid-herd-immunity/2020/10/10/3910251c-0a60-11eb-859b-f9c27abe638d_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told The Washington Pos</a>t in October 2020 that the Barrington Declaration authors’ beliefs were not held “by large numbers of experts in the scientific community.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This is a fringe component of epidemiology. This is not mainstream science. It’s dangerous. It fits into the political views of certain parts of our confused political establishment,” Collins said in the Post interview. “I’m sure it will be an idea that someone can wrap themselves in as a justification for skipping wearing masks or social distancing and just doing whatever they damn well please.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the many reasons public health experts recommended masking, working from home and physical distancing before there was a COVID-19 vaccine was to prevent patients from overwhelming the country’s health care system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There were concerns during some of the spikes in COVID-19 infections that the country would have so many ill people at one time there wouldn’t be enough space, health care professionals or equipment to provide treatment.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Wide-ranging agency</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The NIH is made up of <a href="https://www.nih.gov/institutes-nih/list-institutes-centers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27 different centers and institutes</a> that each focus on health challenges facing Americans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, formerly run by Dr. Anthony Fauci, became one of the more well known institutes during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when he would regularly appear beside Trump at press briefings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other components at NIH include the National Cancer Institute, National Institute on Aging, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and the NIH Clinical Center that’s also referred to as America’s research hospital.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Congress approved $48 billion in discretionary spending for NIH during the last fiscal year, continuing a broadly bipartisan push that for years has increased funding to the agency to provide grants to research some of the most challenging diseases and illnesses facing Americans.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The current NIH director, Monica M. Bertagnolli, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nih-targeting-rare-diseases-director-tells-us-house-funding-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testified before Congress </a>in early November about how the agency was working to rebuild trust following the pandemic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bertagnolli told U.S. House lawmakers the NIH was focusing some of its research on finding cures for rare diseases, since for-profit companies often don’t have the financial incentive to do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She also rejected the notion that NIH leaders have allowed politics to interfere with the agency’s mission.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“First and foremost, NIH concentrates on science, not on politics,” Bertagnolli said. “We actually have an integrity mandate against political interference in our work. That is the law for us and we abide by that completely.”</p>

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz announced Thursday he’s withdrawing as President-elect Donald Trump’s planned nominee for attorney general days after securing the appointment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz’s path to Senate confirmation was highly unlikely following years of investigations about alleged drug usage and payments for sex, including with an underage girl. He submitted his resignation to Congress last week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,” Gaetz wrote in&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1859649045553402285" target="_blank">a social media post.</a> “There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I&#8217;ll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump&#8217;s DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.”&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113522181118234752" target="_blank">posted on social media</a> afterward that he “greatly” appreciated “the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect,” Trump wrote. “Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">When asked if the Trump-Vance transition team had another nominee choice lined up, and whether they viewed the Gaetz withdrawal as a setback, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not provide details.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;President Trump remains committed to choosing a leader for the Department of Justice who will strongly defend the Constitution and end the weaponization of our justice system. President Trump will announce his new decision when it is made,&#8221; Leavitt told States Newsroom in an emailed statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The House Ethics Committee&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-ethics-panel-republicans-vote-against-disclosure-gaetz-report" target="_blank">voted along party lines</a> Wednesday not to release its report on Gaetz, following more than three years of investigation. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including the allegations that he had sex with a minor.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Meetings with senators</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, spent Wednesday shuffling Gaetz between meetings with Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would have held his confirmation hearing. Republicans will control the Senate in the new session of Congress beginning in January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1859657654336983200" target="_blank">wrote on social media</a> that he respected Gaetz’s decision to withdraw his name from consideration as AG.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I look forward to working with President Trump regarding future nominees to get this important job up and running,” Graham said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, incoming Judiciary Committee chair, posted the following on X: “I respect Gaetz decision &amp;look fwd 2helping PresTrump confirm qualified noms 2reform Dept of Justice &amp;bring TRANSPARENCY/ACCOUNTABILITY Trump’s mission = DRAIN THE SWAMP&amp; I would add get some1 who will answer my hundreds of outstanding oversight letters sitting at Biden DOJ/FBI.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Grassley’s staff referred States Newsroom to the social media post when the outlet reached out for comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The offices of Sens. John Kennedy of Louisiana and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, fellow Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans, declined to comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz’s future is unclear, given that he resigned from the U.S. House last week and notified the chamber he didn’t plan to take the oath of office for the upcoming 119th Congress.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He first joined the House in January 2017 and led efforts to remove former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from that role last year, setting off a month-long stalemate within the House Republican Conference over who should lead the party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The race to fill his empty seat in a special election has already&nbsp;<a href="https://floridaphoenix.com/2024/11/21/two-more-republicans-file-to-run-for-matt-gaetz-congressional-seat/" target="_blank">attracted six candidates</a>, mostly Republicans in a heavily conservative-leaning district.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz could jump into the race for his old seat, possibly winning a place back in the House of Representative next year following the special election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He could also try to take the oath of office when the next session of Congress begins on Jan. 3, since he wrote in his resignation letter that he did “not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress, to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump Administration.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">That would give the House Ethics Committee jurisdiction to complete its report on Gaetz and release it publicly.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">AG oversees Department of Justice</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The attorney general is responsible for overseeing the Department of Justice, which includes the federal government&#8217;s top law enforcement agencies as well as prosecutors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Office for Victims of Crime, Office on Violence Against Women and U.S. Attorneys&#8217; offices are among the 40 entities within the DOJ and its 115,000-person workforce.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Congress approved $37.52 billion for the Department of Justice in the most recent full-year spending bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump had two attorneys general during his first term as president. He first nominated former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, whom Trump later fired amid disputes, and then Bill Barr.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Former TV personality and onetime U.S. Senate candidate Mehmet Oz could become the next administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an expansive government agency that is responsible for large swaths of the country’s health care.</p>
<p dir="ltr">President-elect Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate Oz on Tuesday, writing in a statement “there may be no Physician more qualified and capable than Dr. Oz to Make America Healthy Again.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oz won the Republican primary in the 2022 Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race but was <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/oz-concedes-to-fetterman-in-pa-s-u-s-senate-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated during the general election</a> by Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump wrote that Oz would “work closely” with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-taps-vaccine-skeptic-rfk-jr-lead-department-health-and-human-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be nominated for Health and Human Services secretary</a>, “to take on the illness industrial complex, and all the horrible chronic diseases left in its wake.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“He will also cut waste and fraud within our Country’s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of our Nation’s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget,” Trump wrote in the announcement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services manages the country’s largest health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and the health insurance marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are 67.7 million people enrolled in Medicare, with nearly 90% of those enrollees over the age of 65. The program also provides health care coverage for younger people with severe illnesses or disabilities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Medicaid, a state-federal program that provides health coverage for low-income people, has about 72.4 million enrollees.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are 7.1 million CHIP program participants.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And 21.3 million people purchased health insurance through the ACA marketplace during the 2024 open enrollment period.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When added together, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services provides health care coverage to 1 in 4 Americans, according to its latest <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/cms-financial-report-fiscal-year-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial report</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The agency spent about $1.516 trillion during the last fiscal year and has more than 6,700 federal employees as well as contractors to handle the workload.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“CMS and its contractors process over one billion Medicare claims annually, monitor quality of care, provide the states with matching funds for Medicaid benefits, and develop policies and procedures designed to give the best possible service to beneficiaries,” according to the report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“CMS also assures the safety and quality of medical facilities, provides</p>
<p dir="ltr">health insurance protection to workers changing jobs, and maintains</p>
<p dir="ltr">the largest collection of healthcare data in the United States.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oz received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University before earning a joint M.D. and MBA from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Wharton Business School.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He starred in the daytime show “Dr. Oz,” which ran from 2009 until 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Oz’s nomination is subject to Senate confirmation and is under the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, currently led by Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Idaho Republican Sen. Mike Crapo.</p>
<p>Oz’s confirmation hearing won’t be the first time he’s testified before a Senate committee. More than 10 years ago, <a href="https://apnews.com/united-states-congress-united-states-government-television-ab2b321bd7bf40ebb4c80e49bb19d284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he testified in front of a Senate panel </a>that his comments on his TV show about certain weight loss supplements were “flowery.”</p>

Matt Gaetz is photographed inside the Rayburn House Office Building Feb. 27, 2019. &nbsp;(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz as the next attorney general of the United States, an unexpected pick as the Florida Republican remains the subject of a congressional ethics investigation for alleged sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and accepting improper gifts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">House Speaker Mike Johnson announced on Wednesday night at a GOP press conference following leadership elections that Gaetz has already submitted a letter of resignation from the House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think out of deference to us, he issued his resignation letter effective immediately of Congress,” Johnson said. “That caught us by surprise a little bit, but I asked him what the reasoning was, and he said, ‘Well, you can&#8217;t have too many absences.’”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Florida state law, Johnson said, provides an eight-week time frame for the governor to fill a vacancy. He’s already placed a call to Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is in Italy, to ask him to begin that timeline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“And if we start the clock now, if you do the math, we may be able to fill that seat as early as January 3, when we take the new oath of office for the new Congress,” Johnson said.&nbsp; “So Matt would have done us a great service by making that decision, as he did on the fly. And so we&#8217;re grateful for that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The position of attorney general requires U.S. Senate approval, and if confirmed, the four-term congressman and Trump ally would lead the massive U.S. Justice Department that oversees more than 40 component organizations and 115,000 employees, according to the department.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The announcement comes as U.S. special counsel Jack Smith&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-prosecutors-move-wind-down-trump-jan-6-case-after-win-presidential-race" target="_blank">winds down</a> two federal investigations of Trump — one, alleging Trump improperly stored classified government documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after leaving office, and the other stemming from his alleged scheme to subvert the 2020 presidential election. Justice Department memos from 1973 and 2000 concluded that criminally prosecuting a sitting president would impair the leader’s capacity to carry out the office’s functions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump first announced his decision to choose Gaetz on social media, describing the congressman as “a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William &amp; Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Revealing the information on Truth Social roughly 10 minutes before his transition team sent an official statement, the president-elect wrote that Gaetz “will root out the systemic corruption at DOJ, and return the Department to its true mission of fighting Crime, and upholding our Democracy and Constitution. We must have Honesty, Integrity, and Transparency at DOJ. Under Matt’s leadership, all Americans will be proud of the Department of Justice once again.” Trump routinely writes on social media in mixed capitalization.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz quickly published on the social media platform X that, “It will be an honor to serve as President Trump’s Attorney General!”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Ethics probe</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The House Committee on Ethics&nbsp;<a href="https://ethics.house.gov/press-releases/statement-regarding-matter-representative-matt-gaetz" target="_blank">revealed</a> in June that it would continue pursuing allegations in its ongoing investigation of Gaetz, including the possibility the lawmaker may have “engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz has “categorically denied all of the allegations before the Committee,” according to the committee’s June update on the matter.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The committee’s probe began in April 2021 and originally included allegations that the lawmaker “shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe or improper gratuity.” The committee announced in June that it was no longer pursuing those specific accusations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of June, the panel had&nbsp;spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas, and reviewed thousands of pages of documents regarding the Gaetz probe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rep. Michael Guest, chair of the House Ethics Committee, told reporters Wednesday that if Gaetz is confirmed by the Senate as attorney general, his committee will no longer have jurisdiction over the probe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Once we lose jurisdiction, there would not be a report that would be issued,” said Guest, a Mississippi Republican elected to Congress in 2019. “That&#8217;s not unique to this case, we have that every new Congress, where there are members who are under ethics investigation, who either choose not to run again, in some instances, or they resign or they lose reelection.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We&#8217;re not going to rush this investigation because of the appointment. And so we&#8217;re going to again follow the rules and the procedures that we set in place.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ethics investigation is expected to wrap up following Gaetz’s resignation, though Punchbowl News&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/JakeSherman/status/1856859774211563535" target="_blank">reported</a> that the panel was set to release a “highly damaging” report in the days ahead</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Lawmakers taken aback</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Senators on Capitol Hill, who will have to vet and possibly vote to confirm Gaetz, expressed surprise at Trump’s announcement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski said that she expected to consider another option at some point.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s a serious nomination for the attorney general,” Murkowski said. “We need to have a serious attorney general and I&#8217;m looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody that is serious.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she was shocked when she heard the news. She said that she and her colleagues will want to question Gaetz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Obviously, the president has the right to nominate whomever he wishes. But I&#8217;m certain that there will be a lot of questions,” Collins, a Republican, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said he doesn’t know Gaetz “other than his public persona,” but said Gaetz will face questions and possibly challenges getting the votes needed for Senate confirmation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have a lot of questions, and I&#8217;m sure all that stuff will come out,” Cornyn said. “And then it&#8217;s a question of, can he get 51 votes?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., said that Republicans were the ones to question about whether they’d support Gaetz’s nomination, since Democrats were unlikely to do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Talk to my colleagues, like, to see who&#8217;s gonna vote for, like, a jerk-off like that,” Fetterman said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said Gaetz “has his work cut out for him,” and that it will be up to the Judiciary Committee to decide whether to confirm him to the post.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio, who Trump on Wednesday nominated as secretary of State, said that he was supportive of the president-elect’s pick.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’ve known Matt for a long time, I think he would do a good job,” Rubio said, adding that he wouldn’t comment further about the recent ethics complaints against Gaetz.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democrats who sit on the Judiciary Committee that would be tasked with holding a nomination hearing for Gaetz, such as Cory Booker of New Jersey and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, declined to comment on the news.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m literally just walking out of a meeting and hearing this,” Booker said. “Give me a minute.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson said he honestly doesn’t “know (Gaetz) that well or know his professional qualifications.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know of his skill in questioning witnesses in the House,” Johnson said. “I really don&#8217;t know his legal background that much. I&#8217;ve never really spent much time with him, other than a couple times in different meetings, so I just don’t know him that well.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rep. Jim Himes, ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a strong rebuke of Trump’s choice of Gaetz for the position.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The Attorney General of the United States must have strong judgement, moral character, and a deep respect for the law. As almost all members of Congress know, Matt Gaetz has none of those things. What he does have is unconditional loyalty to Donald Trump and a willingness to weaponize the government against his political allies— an affinity that he and the president-elect share,” Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a statement.</p>

(Jeenah Moon/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — On the final frantic Sunday of the presidential race, while Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a Black church service in Michigan, former President Donald Trump told supporters at a Pennsylvania rally that he “shouldn’t have left” the White House after he lost the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>At a campaign rally at an airplane tarmac in Lititz, Pennsylvania, Trump again perpetuated the falsehood that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him and claimed that this year’s election would also be stolen because election results could take a while to be counted.</p>
<p>“These elections have to be decided by 9 o’clock, 10 o’clock, 11 o’clock on Tuesday night,” he said. “Bunch of crooked people.”</p>
<p>Election officials have warned that<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/final-results-may-lag-deadlocked-presidential-contest-anxious-election-officials-warn" target="_blank"> results could take days to finalize.</a></p>
<p>The comments came as new polls showed good news for Harris. A highly regarded pollster in Iowa showed a shocking lead for Harris there and New York Times-Siena College polls of the seven major battleground states showed slight leads for Harris in some Sun Belt swing states, while Trump made gains in the Rust Belt.</p>
<p>As the campaign dwindles to its final hours, here are seven key developments from this weekend:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump says he ‘shouldn’t have left’ White House</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump spent much of his Lititz rally complaining about the election process and media coverage, seeming to repeat his false claim that he was the rightful winner of the 2020 election.</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have left, I mean, honestly,” Trump said. “We did so well, we had such a great — so now, every polling booth has hundreds of lawyers standing there.”</p>
<p>He also <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/pennsylvania-lititz-lancaster-trump-rants-about-polls-says-i-dont-mind-if-someone-shoots-through-the-fake-news-at-pa-rally/" target="_blank">joked about shooters targeting reporters</a> covering his event, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.</p>
<p>He pointed to protective glass covering him on two sides and noted a press section was on another side of him.</p>
<p>“To get me, someone would have to shoot through the fake news,” Trump said. “And I don’t mind that so much.”</p>
<p>In a statement that seemed to contradict the plain meaning of Trump’s remark, campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung denied Trump was encouraging violence against reporters.</p>
<p>“The President’s statement about protective glass placement has nothing to do with the Media being harmed, or anything else,” Cheung wrote. “It was about threats against him that were spurred on by dangerous rhetoric from Democrats. In fact, President Trump was stating that the Media was in danger, in that they were protecting him and, therefore, were in great danger themselves, and should have had a glass protective shield, also. There can be no other interpretation of what was said. He was actually looking out for their welfare, far more than his own!”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris heads to the Big Apple</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Harris made an unscheduled trip to New York City Saturday, where she made a surprise appearance during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Funs6yyEw" target="_blank">cold open of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live”</a> alongside actress Maya Rudolph, who portrays the veep in the live sketch comedy show.</p>
<p>In the three-minute opener, Rudolph approaches a vanity dresser and wishes she could talk to “someone who was in my shoes” as a “Black, South Asian woman running for president, preferably from the Bay Area.”</p>
<p>Rudolph turns toward the faux mirror, and Harris, on the other side, responds, “You and me both, sister.”</p>
<p>They wore identical suits and Harris turned to Rudolph and said that she is “here to remind you, you got this.”</p>
<p>“Because you can do something your opponent cannot do. You can open doors,” Harris said, joking about a recent campaign event where Trump tried to open the door to a garbage truck.</p>
<p>Rudolph cackled, doing an impersonation of Harris’ laugh, before the two women began a pep talk with puns of Harris’ first name.</p>
<p>“Now, Kamala, take my palmala,” Rudolph said. “The American people want to stop the chaos.”</p>
<p>“And end the dramala,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Harris and Rudolph then stood side-by-side and said they were going to vote for “us.”</p>
<p>Harris joked and asked Rudolph if she was registered to vote in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Harris headed from New York to Michigan, where she spoke Sunday at the historically Black Greater Emmanuel Institutional Church of God in Christ in Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polling bombshell in a non-swing state</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Polling in the latest <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/iowa-poll/2024/11/02/iowa-poll-kamala-harris-leads-donald-trump-2024-presidential-race/75354033007/" target="_blank">Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll</a>, reported a shocking lead for Harris in a state that Trump easily won in 2016 and 2020, with women and independent voters breaking for the Democratic presidential nominee.</p>
<p>The poll shows Harris leading with 47% of likely voters compared to 44% with Trump, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-final-iowa-poll-2024-election" target="_blank">according to the Register.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.nucleusfiles.com/a4/a4f946f9-4e27-4bae-8e32-e77638040f06/11.2-djt-iowa-poll.pdf?_nlid=S2fMS533ZU&amp;_nhids=g2dmirPedj" target="_blank">The Trump campaign </a>quickly called the Iowa poll “a clear outlier,” and instead cited a <a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/november-2024-iowa-poll-trump-53-harris-43/" target="_blank">poll by Emerson College </a>as accurate, which showed the former president having 53% support compared to 43% for Harris.</p>
<p>Trump also took his grievances to his social media site, Truth Social.</p>
<p>“All polls, except for one heavily skewed toward the Democrats by a Trump hater who called it totally wrong the last time, have me up, BY A LOT,” he wrote. “I LOVE THE FARMERS, AND THEY LOVE ME.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/us/politics/harris-trump-times-siena-poll.html" target="_blank">The New York Times/Siena College Sunday polls</a> found that Harris is improving in North Carolina and Georgia while Trump has gained in Pennsylvania and maintains a strong advantage in Arizona. Harris is still ahead in Nevada and Wisconsin, according to the poll, but Michigan and Pennsylvania remain tied. The poll of Georgia showed Harris with a 1-point edge.</p>

<p>Both candidates were within the polls’ margins of error, meaning that the seven swing states could tip to either candidate.</p>
<p>While both Democratic and Republican politicians have expressed confidence in winning the election, polling experts said during a <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?539658-1/political-analysts-discuss-2024-elections&amp;live" target="_blank">panel</a> hosted by the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute in late October there’s no way to know for sure who will control the White House until all the votes are counted.</p>
<p>Kristen Soltis Anderson, founding partner at Echelon Insights, said there’s about a 60% chance that this year’s nationwide polling has been mostly correct, though she emphasized that the people who focus their careers on political polling are dedicated to providing a realistic understanding of where campaigns are headed.</p>
<p>“We are trying our very hardest to get it right,” Anderson said. “Even if you don’t believe in our altruism or even if you don’t believe in our academic and intellectual integrity, believe in nothing else than our financial incentives. You want to be the pollster who was right. It is very good business to be the pollster who is right.”</p>
<p>Jeff Horwitt, partner at Hart Research, said during the panel his firm has wrapped up its polling for this election year and expressed skepticism about the polls that emerge close to Election Day.</p>
<p>“Because our job, for our political clients, is to tell them the contours of the election,” Horwitt said. “How do we convince voters to vote for our candidate? What are the most effective messages? What do we have to think about? So the public polls are seeing now, they’re super interesting, and they’re important, but they’re not actionable.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump welcomes sexist insult</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As Trump spent his weekend in a campaign blitz across North Carolina, he welcomed a sexist remark from a rallygoer in Greensboro who suggested that Harris worked as a prostitute.</p>
<p>During the Saturday night rally, Trump questioned whether Harris’ previously worked at a McDonald’s. Her campaign has stated that she worked the summer job in 1983. In a campaign photo opportunity, <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/trump-weekend-pennsylvania-arnold-palmer-latrobe-mcdonalds-steelers-elon-musk/" target="_blank">Trump visited a closed McDonald’s </a>in Pennsylvania where he handed fries to pre-screened people at the drive through.</p>
<p>“It’s so simple,” Trump said. “She’s a significant liar, and when you lie about something so simple, so she never worked there –”</p>
<p>“She worked on a corner,” a man from the crowd shouted.</p>
<p>Trump laughed at the crude comment.</p>
<p>“This place is amazing,” Trump said. “Just remember, it’s other people saying it, it’s not me.”</p>
<p>Harris has significantly gained support with women, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/10/10/the-harris-trump-matchup/" target="_blank">according to the Pew Research Center. </a>Trump has often dismissed criticism that he has lagged among women.</p>
<p>During a rally last week in Wisconsin, and in an attempt to win over women voters, Trump said that he would protect women and “I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump repeats ‘father of fertilization’ claim</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>At a Greensboro, North Carolina, rally Saturday, Trump again called himself “the father of fertilization,” a title <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-claims-title-father-ivf-fox-news-town-hall-women-voters" target="_blank">he first gave himself</a> during a Fox News town hall with women voters last month.</p>
<p>“I consider myself to be the father of fertilization,” he said Saturday.</p>
<p>The Iowa poll — and other late surveys — showed a stark gender gap, with women voters increasingly preferring Harris.</p>
<p>Nearly twice as many Iowa independent women voters, 57% to 29%, favored Harris. That represents a major gain for Harris since a September survey by the same pollster showed the vice president’s edge with independent women was only 5 percentage points.</p>
<p>Democrats have sought to exploit their advantage with women voters by emphasizing Trump’s record on abortion access. The former president appointed three of the U.S. Supreme Court justices who voted in 2022 to overturn the federal right to an abortion.</p>
<p>A flurry of state-level policymaking on reproductive rights has followed, including restrictions on in vitro fertilization, a common fertility treatment.</p>
<p>Trump has said he opposed an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that outlawed the treatment in the state, but had not previously taken a position on the issue.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Early voters up to 76 million</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>More than 76 million voters had already cast ballots through early and mail voting by midday Sunday, according to <a href="https://election.lab.ufl.edu/early-vote/2024-early-voting/" target="_blank">the University of Florida’s Election Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Roughly half of those have come in states that track voters’ partisanship. About 700,000 — roughly 2% of the total — more Democrats have voted in those states than Republicans, but the numbers include California, where Democrat Joe Biden won more than 5 million more votes than Trump in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Among the six states — Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Colorado, Idaho and Virginia — that track voters’ gender, women accounted for 54% of the vote, compared to 43.6% for men.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed"> ‘Election eve’ blitz</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The candidates for president and vice president plan to sprint across the key swing states in the campaign’s final days, with particular focus on Pennsylvania, the largest of the contested states where polling has shown a deadlocked race.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign announced Sunday the vice president would be in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia on Monday, the night before Election Day, for rallies and musical performances. Scheduled entertainers and speakers included Oprah Winfrey, The Roots, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.</p>
<p>Harris is also set to hold an event in Allentown, Pennsylvania, a majority-Latino city, on Monday. Part of Harris’ closing message has highlighted racist comments Trump and his supporters have made about Latinos.</p>
<p>After spending much of the weekend in North Carolina, Trump will also hold a rally in Pittsburgh on Monday evening.</p>
<p>Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, will be in Milwaukee on Monday.</p>
<p>Trump running mate Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance will hold events in Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania on Monday.</p>
<p>Harris will hold an election night watch party at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Trump’s watch party will be at his Mar-a-Lago club in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p>

(Brent Stirton/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The threat of political violence will likely hang over the nation’s capital in the weeks following Election Day, security experts say, despite intensive preparations by law enforcement officials determined to avoid another Jan. 6 insurrection.</p>
<p>The 2,000-plus officers who make up the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as other federal law enforcement agencies like the Secret Service, have responded to a surge in threats against elected officials during the last few years, including two assassination attempts against Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump just this year.</p>
<p>But the threats, attacks and shooting have led to questions about whether the two agencies are truly prepared for the presidential transition, especially after a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_1017_opa-Independent-Review-Panel-Final-Report-and-Accompanying-Materials.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released this week said the Secret Service “requires fundamental reform to carry out its mission.”</p>
<p>The agency is tasked with planning and coordinating security for Congress’ certification of the Electoral College on Jan. 6 —the first time it’s been designated a National Special Security Event — and Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Experts interviewed by States Newsroom said there is a very real chance of political violence in the weeks and months ahead, though they said law enforcement agencies have learned from recent events. The unrest could build after what is expected to be a very close presidential election, with results possibly delayed for days or longer or even litigated in the courts.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, you can never have 100% security,” said Javed Ali, associate professor of practice at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to think that would exist. But, if you’re trying to consider all the different kinds of variables that you have to plan for, there’s always going to be a gap or vulnerability — now what you try to do is kind of minimize the big one and hope that the small ones don’t get exploited.”</p>
<p>Darrell M. West, the Douglas Dillon Chair in Governmental Studies at the Brookings Institution, said the risk of political violence could increase following Election Day if one or more political leaders object to the outcome.</p>
<p>“For months, we’ve been hearing extreme and sometimes violent rhetoric,” West said. “And rhetoric has consequences — it can encourage some people to take action.”</p>
<p>Trump has refused to accept the 2020 election results, and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/vance-replies-to-question-about-2020-election-with-answer-about-hunter-bidens-laptop/" target="_blank">declined to say </a>Trump lost the election. Vance on Oct. 12<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/vance-in-pennsylvania-says-there-was-a-peaceful-transfer-of-power-in-january-2021/" target="_blank"> said</a> there was a “peaceful transfer of power” in January 2021.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly recycled false claims he made following his loss that the system is rigged — a talking point he’s likely to use to rile up supporters should he lose this year’s election. Trump has been <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2024/10/02/special-counsel-jack-smith-reveals-new-evidence-against-trump-in-2020-election-case/" target="_blank">charged</a> by special counsel Jack Smith with four felony counts in connection with 2020 election interference, in a complex case that will continue after the election.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Threats against lawmakers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Members of Congress are more vulnerable than presidential candidates, in part because most lawmakers live in normal houses and don’t have security details anywhere close to the kind the Secret Service provides for high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>And unlike the presidency, which has a long line of succession to avoid gaps in authority following a death or a crisis, Congress has been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/23/congress-plan-mass-casualty-emergency-00178190" target="_blank">criticized for not having better plans in place </a>to address continuity of government following a mass casualty or similar event.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-capitol-police-chief-describes-preparations-possible-post-election-turmoil" target="_blank">testified in April </a>the agency was looking for ways to bolster protection for lawmakers in the line of presidential succession, like the speaker of the House and Senate president pro tempore.</p>
<p>Manger told the panel that security for those two officials was substandard to that provided for the Secretary of State, who sits below them in the line of succession.</p>
<p>“We can’t just go back to the days when we said, ‘Well, we’ll just follow them around and we’ll make sure they’re well protected wherever they are,’ because their homes, their families are at risk,” he testified.</p>
<p>Members of Congress who haven’t risen to the ranks of leadership don’t get security details unless there are specific threats to their safety. And those aren’t permanent.</p>
<p>That could present challenges for lawmakers who have higher profiles or who regularly receive threats, especially if people respond violently to the election results and encourage their supporters to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump assassination attempts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Making the situation more complicated, this year has shown that substantial levels of security aren’t a guarantee of safety.</p>
<p>Trump has some of the highest levels of protection in the country, if not the world, but that did not stop a man from<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank"> shooting at the former president</a> during a rally in Pennsylvania this summer. A separate would-be gunman<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ryan-routh-charged-attempted-assassination-trump-golf-course-case" target="_blank"> was spotted </a>and apprehended just off Trump’s Florida golf course with a semi-automatic weapon in September.</p>
<p>Both instances raised questions about the Secret Service’s ability to protect Trump as well as others, though agency leaders maintain they’re up to the task.</p>
<p>Trump’s experiences, as the subject of political violence, haven’t deterred him from spreading disinformation about Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris as well as other lawmakers who disagree with him on policy issues.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments about immigrants have also led to threats against everyday people, including Haitian immigrants in Ohio, who are in the country legally.</p>
<p>During an interview with Maria Bartiromo on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox News earlier this month, Trump said he may use the National Guard or the military against his political opponents should he win reelection, calling them “the enemy from within.”</p>
<p>“We have some very bad people,” Trump said. “We have some sick people. Radical left lunatics. And it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”</p>
<p>The military and National Guard have significantly different training programs and missions than local, state, or federal law enforcement, making Trump’s comments somewhat darker than previous claims he’d try to put his political opponents in prison if reelected.</p>
<p>Trump hasn’t committed to respecting the results of the election or supporting a peaceful transition in power should he lose his bid for the White House.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments could indicate that violence is likely following the election, if he loses, or after he regains the powers of the presidency, if he wins.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Delayed election results predicted</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>West from the Brookings Institution said violence isn’t likely to take place in the days immediately following the end of voting on Nov. 5, since it’s unlikely anyone learns the results of the presidential election for a few days.</p>
<p>The Associated Press <a href="https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/calling-the-2020-presidential-race-state-by-state" target="_blank">didn’t call the race for President Joe Biden until the Saturday</a> after the election in 2020, following days of speculation and ballot counting.</p>
<p>Mail-in ballots, which Democrats tend to submit in larger numbers than Republicans, could lead to confusion in swing states, especially if people don’t understand they tend to boost numbers for Democratic candidates over GOP politicians as they’re counted, he said.</p>
<p>“We could end up in a situation where on election night, Trump is ahead, because we know Republicans tend to vote in person on Election Day, and Democrats often vote via mail ballots,” West said. “And then as the mail ballots get counted on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the numbers may shift from Trump to Harris.</p>
<p>“And I think that’s a very bad combination, because it will look to some individuals like voter fraud, even though there’s a perfectly logical explanation for the change. But that’s a scenario that could lead to violence, because it’ll look like the election is being stolen from Trump.”</p>
<p>While the presidential candidates will play a significant role in stirring up or calming down their supporters, members of Congress, many of whom sought to legitimize misinformation and disinformation four years ago, have responsibilities as well.</p>
<p>“We need leaders who act responsibly, but unfortunately, in the last few months, we have not seen that,” West said. “We’ve seen members of Congress who have promoted misinformation. There’s been a lot of it surrounding the hurricane, and so the fear is that there will be blatant lies that then will incite people to take action.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Learning from 2020</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Ali, from the University of Michigan, said he expects federal law enforcement will be better prepared for post-election violence than they were four years ago, though there are still chances for violent people to slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>The most likely scenario, Ali said, is a single actor or “lone wolf” attack and not a mob marching to the Capitol, the way Trump supporters did on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>“I still think it’s relatively low,” Ali said of the likelihood of violence. “But as we’ve seen, all it takes is one person to really shake up the perception of security. And if they’re aiming at President Trump or Vice President Harris, well then, you know the stakes are even higher.”</p>
<p>Ali said he’s confident that the Secret Service, U.S. Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies in the Washington, D.C., area are preparing for various scenarios, though he’s less sure about what would happen if there’s violence at state capitals.</p>
<p>“There might be a little more vulnerability there,” Ali said. “But I still think, at least when we’re getting to the Electoral College (certification) day, that January 6th-type insurrection will be almost impossible to pull off.”</p>
<p>When it comes to spreading disinformation, Ali said, he expects there will be a combination of foreign adversaries, including Iran and Russia, as well as domestic actors.</p>
<p>“You’ll probably see a lot of disinformation, especially if Vice President Harris wins, sort of casting doubt on the integrity of the voting, the credibility of the process, maybe going after specific individuals and key swing states, or even counties,” Ali said.</p>
<p>“All those things that were happening in 2020. But there were also costs to doing that, as we’ve seen too, with the civil charges and some of the potential criminal ones as well,” he added. “So I think that’s also an area domestically, where people will have to tread very cautiously. That doesn’t mean that you won’t see it, but again, there might be a line that gets crossed where people will be held accountable for that.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘More prepared than ever before’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police Inspector General David T. Harper said USCP leadership has implemented the 100-plus recommendations put forward by his predecessor following the Jan. 6 attack, closing gaps that existed that day.</p>
<p>“I think they’ve made a lot of improvements, and I think that they’re more prepared than ever before,” Harper said, though he later added he couldn’t “say for certain that they are prepared to handle anything that can come up” due to the unpredictable nature of domestic terrorism and political violence.</p>
<p>The OIG is also “prepared to be all hands on deck” in the event of another attack on the Capitol or lawmakers takes place, to analyze what went wrong and make recommendations for USCP to implement, he said.</p>
<p>Harper, whose tenure as inspector general <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/01/23/new-capitol-police-inspector-general-selected/" target="_blank">began earlier this year</a>, noted during the interview that much of what he can publicly discuss is restricted by national security concerns.</p>
<p>The U.S. Capitol Police declined an interview request from States Newsroom, but provided written information about changes that it’s implemented during the last few years.</p>
<p>Among those is a law approved by Congress that allows the USCP chief to request the National Guard without the approval of the three-member Capitol Police board.</p>
<p>USCP has also overhauled its intelligence-gathering activities and established partnerships with other law enforcement agencies to bolster its ranks ahead of major events.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Secret Service planning for Jan. 6</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Secret Service is one of those partners and it will take the lead this year planning security for major events during the presidential transition, even those undertaken by Congress inside the Capitol.</p>
<p>While Inauguration Day has traditionally been categorized as a National Special Security Event, the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/additional-security-will-be-place-jan-6-2025-certification-presidential-vote" target="_blank">has extended that classification</a> for the first time for Congress certifying the winner of the presidential race on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Nate Herring, spokesperson for the United States Secret Service, said part of the process includes planning with other law enforcement agencies for “various scenarios” that could take place, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Metropolitan Police Department.</p>
<p>“We work very closely with our partners throughout the whole planning process,” Herring said. “And D.C. is especially unique because National Special Security Events occur fairly frequently.”</p>
<p>But the Secret Service’s leadership and structure have come under scrutiny during the last few months.</p>
<p>The four-member panel tasked with investigating the Pennsylvania assassination attempt against Trump wrote in the<a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2024-10/24_1017_opa-Independent-Review-Panel-Final-Report-and-Accompanying-Materials.pdf" target="_blank"> 52-page report</a> released in mid-October that the Secret Service “has become bureaucratic, complacent, and static even though risks have multiplied and technology has evolved.”</p>
<p>“This is a zero-fail mission, for any failure endangers not only the life of the protectee, but also the fundamentals of our government itself,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Without substantial changes to the Secret Service, the independent review panel wrote, it believes the type of deadly attack that took place in Butler, Pennsylvania, “can and will happen again.”</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas released a written statement after the report’s release, saying the department had begun “taking the actions needed to advance the Secret Service’s protection mission,” including addressing the “systemic and foundational issues” described by the review panel.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">D.C. planning</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>District of Columbia Assistant City Administrator Chris Rodriguez said that city officials will be watching for any indications people intent on violence begin traveling or gathering inside the city following Election Day.</p>
<p>“We are obviously attuned to what happened last time. I mean, I don’t think we can ignore that, and we’re not,” Rodriguez said, referring to the Jan. 6 attack. “But we also are in a place where we have great relationships among our agencies within the region, with the federal government in terms of coordination, and we will be prepared to adapt our operational posture in any way that we need to.”</p>
<p>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser originally requested the NSSE designation for Jan. 6, which Rodriguez said has increased planning and coordination, in hopes of avoiding any violence.</p>
<p>Rodriguez also stressed D.C. officials and the city’s police department are used to planning for the large crowds and protests that tend to take place whenever there’s a presidential transition.</p>
<p>“We are a city that prides itself, as the nation’s capital, to ensuring that there is a peaceful transition of power,” he said. “And we will do our part to ensure that.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The presidential debate in early September included just one mention of Social Security and three references to Medicare, making the safety net programs a minuscule part of the policy discussion, despite their importance to tens of millions of Americans.</p>
<p>Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump have both mentioned the programs numerous times during appearances, though neither campaign has sought to elevate the financial stability of the two programs as a core issue.</p>
<p>More often than not, Harris and Trump rebuke their opponent, while committing to “save” Social Security and Medicare — skipping over the details or the role Congress must play in the discussion.</p>
<p>How to address projected shortfalls for both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds will become an increasingly important topic for the president and Congress during the next decade.</p>
<p>The latest Social Security <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/" target="_blank">trustees report </a>expects the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and the Disability Insurance trust funds will be able to pay full benefits until 2035, after which, without action by lawmakers, benefits would drop to about 83%.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cms.gov/oact/tr/2024" target="_blank">trustee report </a>for Medicare shows the funding stream for the hospital insurance trust fund can cover all of its bills through 2036 before it would only be able to cover 89% of costs.</p>
<p>There are currently 67.5 million people <a href="https://data.cms.gov/summary-statistics-on-beneficiary-enrollment/medicare-and-medicaid-reports/medicare-monthly-enrollment" target="_blank">enrolled in Medicare</a>, which provides health insurance and prescription drug coverage for people over the age of 65 as well as younger people who have certain severe illnesses or disabilities.</p>
<p>Nearly 68 million people receive some level of benefit from Social Security each month, accounting for about $1.5 trillion in spending by the federal government annually, according to a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf" target="_blank">fact sheet</a>.</p>
<p>While the issue is somewhat less pressing for Trump, who would be term limited to another four years, Harris could theoretically spend the next eight years in the Oval Office, making the solvency of the trust funds an issue she would likely need to address with Congress.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Protecting seniors</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During the September debate, Harris brought up Social Security and Medicare following a question about how her policy beliefs on fracking, assault weapons and border security have changed over time.</p>
<p>“My work that is about protecting Social Security and Medicare is based on long-standing work that I have done. Protecting seniors from scams,” Harris said as part of a longer answer. “My values have not changed. And what is important is that there is a president who actually brings values and a perspective that is about lifting people up and not beating people down and name-calling.”</p>
<p>Harris later brought up Medicare again, noting that legislation Congress approved during Biden’s term in office allowed program administrators to negotiate certain prescription drug prices for the first time. That law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, also capped the cost of insulin for Medicare enrollees at $35 per month.</p>
<p>Trump didn’t broach the subject of Social Security or Medicare during the September debate with Harris, but he did speak about the two programs during an earlier summer debate with President Joe Biden, before he stepped aside as the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>During that debate, Trump claimed the Biden administration was going to “destroy” the two programs by allowing noncitizens to draw down benefits.</p>
<p>FactCheck <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/04/posts-misrepresent-immigrants-eligibility-for-social-security-numbers-benefits/" target="_blank">notes on its website</a> that comments and viral posts about noncitizens receiving Social Security benefits don’t always represent reality and sometimes confuse different programs.</p>
<p>“Immigrants who are lawfully living or authorized to work in the U.S. are eligible for a Social Security number and, in some cases, Social Security benefits. But viral posts make the false claim that ‘illegal immigrants’ can receive Social Security numbers and retirement benefits, and they confuse two programs managed by the Social Security Administration.”</p>
<p>KFF <a href="https://www.kff.org/faqs/medicare-open-enrollment-faqs/can-immigrants-enroll-in-medicare/" target="_blank">writes on its website</a> that whether legal immigrants are eligible for Medicare depends on several factors, including how long they’ve paid into the system.</p>
<p>“New immigrants are not eligible for Medicare regardless of their age. Once immigrants meet the residency requirements, eligibility and enrollment work the same as they do for others.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump on entitlement programs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump’s comments on entitlement programs haven’t always been consistent or entirely clear, but his campaign and he both maintain they will “save” the program.</p>
<p>During an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/03/11/former-president-donald-trump-on-entitlements-theres-tremendous-numbers-of-things-you-can-do.html" target="_blank">interview with CNBC</a> in March, Trump said that there are numerous things lawmakers could do to address solvency.</p>
<p>“There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,” Trump said, declining to list any of those policy proposals.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign website <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47/we-must-protect-medicare-and-social-security" target="_blank">posted a video</a> of him back in January 2023, saying Republicans “should not cut a penny” from Medicare or Social Security to pay for other legislation.</p>
<p>The problems facing Social Security and Medicare aren’t related to Congress reducing the amount of tax dollars flowing into the programs. Rather it is the structure for the programs lawmakers set up previously.</p>
<p>Without action by Congress, the trust funds won’t be able to account for benefit payments in the long term.</p>
<p>So the challenge for the next president won’t be preventing lawmakers from taking action related to Social Security and Medicare, but helping find a bipartisan path forward on legislation to change revenue, spending, or both.</p>
<p>Trump does want to end taxes on Social Security benefits, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112881452914352595" target="_blank">writing on social media</a> in July that “SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!”</p>
<p>Henry Aaron, the Bruce and Virginia MacLaury Chair and senior fellow in the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution, wrote in a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-voters-guide-to-social-security/" target="_blank">detailed </a>analysis of the platform that Trump’s proposal to end income tax on Social Security benefits “would accelerate trust fund depletion by about two years and deepen the long-run funding gap by more than 7%.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Harris policies</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Harris’ <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/" target="_blank">campaign website</a> says she would “protect Social Security and Medicare against relentless attacks from Donald Trump and his extreme allies.”</p>
<p>“She will strengthen Social Security and Medicare for the long haul by making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes,” the policy page states. “She will always fight to ensure that Americans can count on getting the benefits they earned.”</p>
<p>Harris <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-rolls-out-broad-medicare-plan-provide-long-term-care-home" target="_blank">announced in early October </a>during an appearance on “The View” that if elected she would work toward including long-term home care for seniors enrolled in Medicare.</p>
<p>“There are so many people in our country who are right in the middle: They’re taking care of their kids and they’re taking care of their aging parents, and it’s just almost impossible to do it all, especially if they work,” Harris said during the live interview. “We’re finding that so many are then having to leave their job, which means losing a source of income, not to mention the emotional stress.”</p>
<p>The proposals would likely need partial, if not complete, buy-in from Congress to move forward and could come with a $40 billion annual price tag, though the campaign noted in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25196234-harrismedicareathomeplan" target="_blank">a fact sheet </a>that there are pay-fors.</p>
<p>“These new benefits will be fully paid for and extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by expanding Medicare drug price negotiations, increasing the discounts drug manufacturers cover for certain brand-name drugs in Medicare and addressing Medicare fraud,” it states.</p>
<p>A Harris administration would also “crack down on pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) to increase transparency, disclose more information on cost, and regulate other practices that raise prices” and “implement international tax reform” to pay for the changes.</p>

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)</p><p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump defended his plans for steep tariffs on Tuesday, arguing economists who say that those higher costs would get passed onto consumers are incorrect and that his proposals would benefit American manufacturing.</p>
<p>During an argumentative hour-long interview with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago, Trump vehemently denied tariffs on certain imported goods would lead to further spikes in inflation and sour America’s relationship with allies, including those in Europe.</p>
<p>“The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States, and build a factory in the United States so it doesn’t have to pay the tariff,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Micklethwait questioned Trump about what would happen to consumer prices during the months or even years it would take companies to build factories in the United States and hire workers.</p>
<p>Trump responded that he could make tariffs “so high, so horrible, so obnoxious that they’ll come right away.” Earlier during the interview, Trump mentioned placing tariffs on foreign-made products as high as 100% or 200%.</p>
<p>Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson Joseph Costello wrote in a statement released following the interview that “Trump showed exactly why Americans can’t afford a second Trump presidency.”</p>
<p>“An angry, rambling Donald Trump couldn’t focus, had to be repeatedly reminded of the topic at hand, and whenever he did stake out a position, it was so extreme that no Americans would want it,” Costello wrote. “This was yet another reminder that a second Trump term is a risk Americans simply cannot take.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Smoot-Hawley memories</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Micklethwait noted during the interview that 40 million jobs and 27% of gross domestic product within the United States rely on trade, questioning how tariffs on those products would help the economy.</p>
<p>He also asked Trump if his plans for tariffs could lead the country down a similar path to the one that followed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R9FOGmt7x0" target="_blank">Smoot-Hawley tariff law</a> becoming law in June 1930. Signed by President Herbert Hoover, some historians and economists have linked the law to the beginning of the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Trump disagreed with Micklethwait, though he didn’t detail why his proposals to increase tariffs on goods from adversarial nations as well as U.S. allies wouldn’t begin a trade war.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate’s <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Passes_Smoot_Hawley_Tariff.htm" target="_blank">official explainer </a>on the Smoot-Hawley tariffs describes the law as being “among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history.” And the Congressional Research Services notes in a <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11030" target="_blank">report</a> on U.S. tariff policy that it was the last time lawmakers set tariff rates.</p>
<p>Desmond Lachman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, <a href="https://www.aei.org/economics/the-economic-consequences-of-a-second-trump-presidency/" target="_blank">wrote last month</a> that Trump’s proposal to implement tariffs of at least 60% on goods imported from China as well as 10 to 20% on all other imports could have severe economic consequences.</p>
<p>“It is difficult to see how such a unilateral trade policy in flagrant violation of World Trade Organization rules would not lead to retaliation by our trade partners with import tariff increases of their own,” Lachman wrote. “As in the 1930s, that could lead us down the destructive path of beggar-my-neighbor trade policies that could cause major disruption to the international trade system. Such an occurrence would be particularly harmful to our export industries and would heighten the chances of both a US and worldwide economic recession.”</p>
<p>CRS notes in its reports that while the Constitution grants Congress the authority to establish tariffs, lawmakers have given the president some authority over it as well.</p>
<p>The United States’ membership in the World Trade Organization and various other trade agreements also have “tariff-related commitments,” according to CRS.</p>
<p>“For more than 80 years, Congress has delegated extensive tariff-setting authority to the President,” the CRS report states. “This delegation insulated Congress from domestic pressures and led to an overall decline in global tariff rates. However, it has meant that the U.S. pursuit of a low-tariff, rules-based global trading system has been the product of executive discretion. While Congress has set negotiating goals, it has relied on Presidential leadership to achieve those goals.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The presidency and the Fed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Trump said during the interview that he believes the president should have more input into whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers interest rates, though he didn’t answer a question about keeping Jerome Powell as the chairman through the end of his term.</p>
<p>“I think I have the right to say I think he should go up or down a little bit,” Trump said. “I don’t think I should be allowed to order it. But I think I have the right to put in comments as to whether or not interest rates should go up or down.”</p>
<p>Trump declined to answer a question about whether he’s spoken with Russian leader Vladimir Putin since leaving office.</p>
<p>“I don’t comment on that,” Trump said. “But I will tell you that if I did, it’s a smart thing. If I’m friendly with people, if I have a relationship with people, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing.”</p>
<p>Journalist Bob Woodward wrote in his new book “War” that Trump and Putin<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-biden-putin-war-ukraine-russia-zelenskyy-ce9c59f689d3f438264a64b2bfa0aa39" target="_blank"> have spoken at least seven times</a> and that Trump secretly sent Putin COVID-19 tests during the pandemic, which the Kremlin later confirmed, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/11/europe/kremlin-confirms-trump-covid-tests-intl/index.html" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/kremlin-confirms-donald-trump-covid-test-vladimir-putin-president-russia-us-abbott-point/" target="_blank">news</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/russia-says-trump-sent-covid-tests-to-putin-during-the-pandemic-221571653668" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p>
<p>Trump said the presidential race will likely come down to Pennsylvania, Michigan and possibly Arizona.</p>
<p>The Economic Club of Chicago has also invited Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris for a sit-down interview.</p>

Pictured is the U.S. Capitol on March 14, 2024. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Members of Congress left Capitol Hill last week to focus their attention on the campaign trail during the six weeks leading up to Election Day, leaving much of their work unfinished.</p>
<p>The Republican House and Democratic Senate are scheduled to remain on recess until Nov. 12, though the urgent needs created in the wake of Hurricane Helene, which are fully funded for the moment, could bring the chambers back into session before then.</p>
<p>When lawmakers do return to Washington, D.C., they’ll need to address the must-pass legislation they’ve left on autopilot instead of negotiating new bipartisan compromises.</p>
<p>So far this year, lawmakers have pushed off reaching brokering agreement on must-pass measures <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/delayed-farm-bill-punted-until-after-election-congress-stuck-how-pay-it" target="_blank">like the farm bill</a> as well as this year’s batch of government funding bills and the annual defense policy legislation.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Kids’ online safety, radiation exposure</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There are also a handful of measures that have passed one chamber with broad bipartisan support, but haven’t been taken up on the other side of the Capitol that leadership could decide to move forward during November or December.</p>
<p>For example, an interesting combination of senators, led by Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal and Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn, are advocating for House Republican leaders to hold votes on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/senate-child-online-safety-vote-f27c329679feb2d74787fc3887aa710f" target="_blank">a pair of online safety bills </a>designed to better protect children from the darker side of the internet.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/05/12/bipartisan-rail-safety-bill-headed-for-u-s-senate-vote/" target="_blank">rail safety bill</a> drafted by a bipartisan group of senators from Ohio and Pennsylvania after the train derailment in East Palestine remains unaddressed following more than a year of intransigence.</p>
<p>And legislation to reauthorize the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/reca-expansion-passes-us-senate" target="_blank">passed the Senate</a> on a broadly bipartisan vote earlier this year, sits on a shelf collecting dust in the House.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/cancer-victims-implore-us-house-take-compensation-radiation-exposure" target="_blank">Cancer victims</a>, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/families-are-suffering-indigenous-people-impacted-radiation-head-capitol-hill" target="_blank">Indigenous communities</a> and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/people-affected-radiation-exposure-push-congress-extend-benefits" target="_blank">many others </a>have pressed House GOP leadership to hold a vote to reauthorize the program after it expired this summer, but they have avoided it due to cost.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Five-week lame duck</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Lawmakers interviewed by States Newsroom and congressional leaders all indicated the outcome of the November elections will have significant sway on what Congress approves during the five-week lame-duck session that spans November and December.</p>
<p>All interviews took place before Hurricane Helene made landfall and Israel was directly attacked by Iran, both of which are likely to be at the top of congressional leaders’ to-do lists.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Whip John Thune said it’s “hard to say” what, if anything, Congress will approve during the lame-duck session.</p>
<p>“I think a lot will be shaped by what happens in November,” the South Dakota Republican said.</p>
<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said just a day before Hurricane Helene made landfall that Democrats would advocate for passing natural disaster response funding previously requested by the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“Extreme weather events are on the rise and they affect everyone — in blue states, purple states and red states,” Jeffries said. “This is not a partisan issue, it’s an American issue in terms of being there, in times of need for everyday Americans, who have had their lives and livelihood upended.”</p>
<p>Other House Democratic priorities during the lame duck include approving the dozen full-year government funding bills that were supposed to be completed before Oct. 1, the defense policy bill that had the same deadline and the farm bill, which is more than a year overdue.</p>
<p>Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said he “sure hopes” the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act reauthorization bill reaches the president’s desk before the end of the year.</p>
<p>He didn’t rule out lobbying to attach it to a must-pass government funding bill, but said the real hurdle is House GOP leaders.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t need help in the Senate. It just needs the House,” Hawley said. “I’ve had good, productive conversations with Speaker (Mike) Johnson in the last few weeks, and I appreciate his personal engagement on this, and I hope that that will lead to action.”</p>
<p>Haley said the House allowing RECA to expire, preventing people who qualify for the program from receiving benefits, was “outrageous.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Defense priorities, farm bill</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senate Armed Services Chair Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, said staff would work during October to bridge the differences between the two chambers on the annual defense policy bill, called the National Defense Authorization Act.</p>
<p>Those staff-level talks will lay the foundation for Republicans and Democrats to meet once they return to Capitol Hill following the elections.</p>
<p>“We have to be ready when we come back to go right to the ‘Big Four’ meeting,” he said, referring to the top leaders in both chambers. “That’s our objective.”</p>
<p>Reed said many of the differences between the House and the Senate aren’t typical Defense Department policy issues per se, but are “more political, cultural, social.”</p>
<p>Congress may begin to debate additional military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine this year, though that’s more likely to happen next year, Reed said.</p>
<p>Senate Agriculture Committee Chair Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., said she was making a “big push” for the House and Senate to reach agreement on the farm bill in the months ahead, though she cautioned talks don’t actually constitute a conference.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t call it a conference; technically to have a conference, you have to have a bill passed by the House and a bill passed by the Senate, which will not happen,” Stabenow said.</p>
<p>“But I believe that there is a way,” Stabenow added. “I believe there’s a way to get a bipartisan bill.”</p>
<p>Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, the top Republican on the Agriculture panel, said lawmakers didn’t need the election results to “start working through our disagreements” on the farm bill, adding there’s some new momentum in talks.</p>
<p>“I think what’s changed is that there is a recognition among members, all members, how difficult it is right now as a farmer,” Boozman said. “So that’s really what’s changed in the last three or four months. It’s developing a real sense of urgency for these folks.”</p>
<p>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said the election outcome could influence what lawmakers choose to accomplish during the lame-duck session.</p>
<p>“There’s any number of scenarios, whether it’s NDAA, whether it’s farm bill, whether it’s anything else,” she said. “But it comes down to Leader Schumer.” New York Democrat Chuck Schumer is the majority leader in the Senate.</p>
<p>Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said he expects Congress will broker some agreement on government funding legislation and the NDAA, but not necessarily anything else.</p>
<p>“In an odd way, the better the Dems do on Nov. 5, the more we’ll get done,” Kaine said. “Because I think if the House is going to flip back to Dem, I think the Rs will say, ‘Well, let’s get a whole lot of stuff done before the House goes down.’ So I think the better we do, the more we’ll get done in the lame duck.”</p>
<p>Kaine said if Democrats do well in the elections, they might not need to approve additional aid for Ukraine this Congress, since that funding can last into next year.</p>
<p>“If we don’t do well in the (elections), we might need to do it in the lame duck,” Kaine said. “So that’ll all depend.”</p>

J.D. Vance squared off Tuesday night in a vice presidential debate that marked the last scheduled in-person meeting for the campaigns as Americans decide the country’s next chapter.</p>
<p>Meeting for the first time, Walz and Vance engaged in a policy-heavy, nearly two-hour back-and-forth hosted by CBS News at its studios in New York City. The debate was moderated by Norah O’Donnell, host of the “CBS Evening News,” and Margaret Brennan, who anchors the network’s Sunday political show “Face the Nation.”</p>
<p>The vice presidential candidates emphasized their modest upbringings and laid out their visions to lower high living costs, address charged issues like reproductive rights, immigration and gun violence, and navigate a quickly worsening conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>And, with the presidential contest marking the first since the violent aftermath of the 2020 election, and Trump’s continued false claims that he won, the moderators pressed the men on whether voters would see a peaceful transfer of power, no matter the winner. Vance would not provide a direct answer whether he would have certified the 2020 vote.</p>
<p>Walz is a second-term governor who previously served six terms in the U.S. House. Prior to his election, Walz worked as a public school teacher and football coach while also enlisted in the Minnesota Army National Guard for 24 years.</p>
<p>Vance served in the U.S. Marines for four years before earning his Yale law degree and becoming a venture capitalist and bestselling memoirist. He was first elected to public office in late 2022 to serve as Ohio’s junior U.S. senator.</p>
<p>The mostly amicable debate, with some moments of tension, was a noticeable departure from the bitter polarization on display daily during the presidential campaign. Walz and Vance shook hands and lingered onstage afterward chatting and introducing each other to their wives.</p>
<p>The presidential nominees, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, met on the debate stage <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-tears-trump-over-abortion-rights-and-race-tense-presidential-debate" target="_blank">last month</a> in a more acrimonious exchange during which the former president falsely claimed immigrants were eating pets in Ohio and Harris ripped into him for his remarks on race and abortion.</p>
<p>Trump has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-presses-trump-debate-again-and-democrats-launch-chicken-billboards" target="_blank">refused</a> to debate again. Following the Vance-Walz exchange, the Harris campaign renewed its offer for another presidential meetup offered by CNN in Atlanta later this month.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Growing Middle East conflict</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Answering the first question from the moderators Tuesday night, Walz and Vance sparred over which administration, if elected, would best quell signs of a widening war in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Tensions in the region escalated earlier Tuesday when Iran fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Walz accused Trump of being “fickle” on foreign policy and said the world is worse off since Trump <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-ending-united-states-participation-unacceptable-iran-deal/" target="_blank">pulled</a> the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal. Walz argued for “steady leadership.”</p>
<p>“You saw it experienced today where, along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, (we were) able to stop the incoming attack,” Walz said.</p>
<p>“It’s clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment,” the governor continued.</p>
<p>Vance maintained that Trump headed off heated global conflict by invoking fear.</p>
<p>“We have to remember that as much as Governor Waltz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence,” Vance said. “People were afraid of stepping out of line.”</p>
<p>The barrage in the Middle East followed Israel’s ground <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/israel-order-evacuation-southern-lebanon-border-villages-incursion" target="_blank">incursion</a> into Southern Lebanon and its recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25322/biden-nasrallah-hezbollah-israel" target="_blank">assassination</a> in Beirut of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iranian proxy militant group Hezbollah.</p>
<p>While Israel intercepted the majority of the rockets Tuesday, U.S. Navy destroyers in the Middle East fired roughly a dozen interceptors at incoming Iranian missiles, Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder said.</p>
<p>The Biden administration promised “severe consequences,” though it has not provided details. Harris said late Tuesday that Iran poses a “destabilizing, dangerous force in the Middle East” and her commitment to Israel is “unwavering.”</p>
<p>Despite a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/zelenskyy-washington-meets-us-leaders-beef-support-ukraine" target="_blank">visit</a> to Washington less than a week ago from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the CBS moderators did not ask about the ongoing war in Ukraine, and neither candidate brought up the costly and ongoing fight against Russia’s continued invasion.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2020 election</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Vance and Walz sparred over how Trump handled his loss in the 2020 presidential election and his actions leading up to Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol following a rally that Trump hosted.</p>
<p>Walz said while he and Vance found some areas of common ground at other points during the debate, the two were “miles apart” on Trump’s actions following the 2020 election.</p>
<p>“This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen, and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump’s inability to say – he is still saying he didn’t lose the election,” Walz said.</p>
<p>Vance didn’t directly answer whether he would have certified the electoral count for President Joe Biden had he been a member of Congress at the time, to Walz’s dismay.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty shocked by this,” Walz said. “He lost the election. This is not a debate.”</p>
<p>Walz said he was concerned that Vance wouldn’t follow the example set by former Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to go along with a scheme to recognize fake slates of electors and deny Biden the presidency.</p>
<p>Vance tried to pivot to Harris’ actions following the COVID-19 pandemic and whether she “censored Americans from speaking their mind” before saying that both he and Trump “think that there were problems in 2020.”</p>
<p>There was no evidence of widespread voter fraud during the last presidential election, during which Trump lost both the popular vote and the Electoral College.</p>
<p>Walz also criticized Trump and Vance for using the same narrative ahead of this November’s elections, saying they were “already laying the groundwork for people not accepting” the results should Trump lose.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes and tariffs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Both Harris and Trump have <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/taxes-where-do-trump-and-harris-stand" target="_blank">released</a> economic plans that would add trillions to the national deficit — though analysis after analysis shows Trump’s proposals <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2024/8/26/trump-campaign-policy-proposals-2024?te=1&amp;nl=the-morning&amp;emc=edit_nn_20240903" target="_blank">outpacing</a> Harris’ by at least a few trillion.</p>
<p>Harris and Walz are <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/harris-unveils-plan-curb-price-gouging-boost-child-tax-credit-tackle-rent-hikes" target="_blank">running on</a> an “opportunity economy” theme that would permanently expand the Child Tax Credit, including giving $6,000 to new parents, and provide tax credits and deductions to first-time homebuyers and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Harris, following Biden’s earlier budget proposal, has said she would impose a minimum tax on high-wealth individuals, but vowed steeper levies on long-term capital gains.</p>
<p>Trump has promised to fund the Treasury’s coffers with money raised by taxing imported goods. Largely he wants to extend his signature 2017 tax law and permanently lower the corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>When asked by the moderators how the candidates could accomplish those goals without ballooning the national debt, both Vance and Walz sidestepped directly answering the question. Rather they touted Trump and Biden administration policies and then went on the attack.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump made a promise, and I’ll give you this: He kept it. He took folks to Mar-a-Lago (and) said, ‘You’re rich as hell. I’m gonna give you a tax cut,’” Walz said, adding that Trump’s tariff plan would be “destabilizing” for the economy.</p>
<p>Economists <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/taxes-where-do-trump-and-harris-stand" target="_blank">warn</a> that Trump’s plan to slap tariffs on imports across the board —  as high as 60% on Chinese imports and 100% to 200% on cars and John Deere tractors manufactured in Mexico — could cause consumer prices to increase and invite retaliation.</p>
<p>But Vance said he wanted to “defend my running mate” on the issue.</p>
<p>“We’re going to be taking in a lot of money by penalizing companies for shipping jobs overseas and penalizing countries who employ slave laborers and then ship their products back into our country and undercut the wages of American workers. It’s the heart of the Donald Trump economic plan,” the senator said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">High costs and housing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Both candidates spent significant time addressing housing and child care costs.</p>
<p>Walz touted Harris’ “bold forward plan” that calls for construction of 3 million new homes and “down payment assistance on the front end to get you in a house.”</p>
<p>“A house is much more than just an asset to be traded somewhere. It’s foundational to where you’re at,” Walz said.</p>
<p>Vance said some of Walz’s ideas on housing were “halfway decent.”</p>
<p>One of the central pillars of Trump and Vance’s housing plans is to turn over federal lands to private hands for development.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of federal lands that aren’t being used for anything. They’re not being used for national parks. They’re not being used, and they could be places where we build a lot of housing,” Vance said.</p>
<p>On child care, Walz pledged a paid federal family and medical leave mandate as a priority for the Harris campaign, and advocated a parallel workforce development program for the care professions.</p>
<p>“We have to make it easier for folks to be able to get into that business, and then to make sure that folks are able to pay for that,” Walz said.</p>
<p>The dual goals, he said, “will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want.”</p>
<p>Vance said he sees an opportunity for a “bipartisan solution” to the high cost of child care, though he stopped short of agreeing with a federal paid leave law.</p>
<p>Instead he proposed expanding the potential recipients for federal child care grants.</p>
<p>“These programs only go to one kind of child care model. Let’s say you’d like your church maybe to help you out with child care. Maybe you live in a rural area or an urban area, and you’d like to get together with families in your neighborhood to provide child care and the way that makes the most sense. You don’t get access to any of these federal monies,” Vance said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Immigration, again</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Vance also repeatedly connected the housing shortage and high costs to immigration — the central issue for Trump’s campaign and a common answer from him for several of the nation’s woes.</p>
<p>The Ohio senator said housing is “totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.”</p>
<p>“The people that I’m most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’ open border,” Vance said, referring to the town where he and Trump falsely claimed over and over that Haitian migrants were stealing and eating pets.</p>
<p>Debate moderator Brennan pressed Vance on his claim: “Senator on that point, I’d like for you to clarify. There are many contributing factors to high housing costs. What evidence do you have that migrants are part of this problem?”</p>
<p>Vance said he would share on social media following the debate a Federal Reserve study that supported his claim.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reproductive rights </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Access to abortion and fertility treatments was one of the more contentious areas of disagreement, though neither candidate trod new ground for their party.</p>
<p>Vance maintained the Trump stance that abortion laws should be set by voters or state lawmakers, while Walz said women and their doctors are best suited to make those decisions.</p>
<p>Vance told a story about a woman he grew up with having an abortion, then telling him a few years ago that “she felt like if she hadn’t had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship.”</p>
<p>“And I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party, we’ve got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people’s trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don’t trust us,” Vance said. “And I think that’s one of the things that Donald Trump, and I are endeavoring to do.”</p>
<p>Walz rejected Vance’s position that state lawmakers should determine women’s access to the full slate of reproductive decisions, including fertility treatments.</p>
<p>Walz referenced some of the stories women have told in the last two years about being denied medical care for miscarriages or other dangerous pregnancy complications because of vaguely written state laws that banned or significantly restricted access to abortion.</p>
<p>“This is a very simple proposition: These are women’s decisions to make about their health care,” Walz said, later adding that people should “just mind their own business on this.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gun violence</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The two vice presidential candidates had one of the more genuine exchanges of the debate after the moderators asked them about solutions for gun violence.</p>
<p>Vance conceded that he and Walz both want to reduce the number of people killed by guns every year, but said the solution should center around addressing illegal guns, including those used in drug trafficking, and through changing how schools are designed.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I think that we have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the door stronger. We’ve got to make the windows stronger,” Vance said. “And of course, we’ve got to increase school resource officers, because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn’t fit with recent experience.”</p>
<p>Walz said school shootings are every parent’s “worst nightmare” before telling a story about how his son witnessed a shooting at a community center while playing volleyball.</p>
<p>“Those things don’t leave you,” Walz said, before talking about meeting with parents of the children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, when he was a member of Congress.</p>
<p>“We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,” Walz said. “In Minnesota, we’ve enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks.”</p>
<p>Walz said he absolutely believes Vance hates it when children die from gun violence, but added that’s “not far enough when we know they’re things that work.”</p>
<p>“No one’s trying to scaremonger and say, ‘We’re taking your guns,” Walz said. “But I ask all of you out there, ‘Do you want your schools hardened to look like a fort?’ … when we know there’s countries around the world that their children aren’t practicing these types of drills.”</p>
<p>Vance expressed sympathy that Walz’s son had witnessed a shooting and thanked him for bringing up Finland as an example of a country with a high rate of gun ownership that doesn’t have school shootings.</p>
<p>“I do think it illustrates some of the, frankly, weird differences between our own country’s gun violence problem and Finland,” Vance said, before mentioning higher rates of substance abuse and mental health issues within the United States.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s the whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem, but I do think it’s a big piece of it,” Vance said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hurricane Helene response, climate change </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The two candidates expressed dismay about the destruction stemming from Hurricane Helene in states in the Southeast, but disagreed about how best to address climate change.</p>
<p>Vance said “a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns,” before criticizing how Democrats have drafted climate change laws.</p>
<p>“This idea that carbon emissions drive all the climate change; well let’s just say that’s true, just for the sake of arguments,” Vance said. “Well, if you believe that, what would you want to do? The answer is that you’d want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you’d want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we’re the cleanest economy in the entire world.”</p>
<p>Walz said that Biden and Harris have worked with Congress to enact legislation addressing climate change that also created jobs.</p>
<p>“We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have. We’re also producing more clean energy,” Walz said. “Reducing our impact is absolutely critical, but this is not a false choice. You can do that at the same time you’re creating the jobs that we’re seeing all across the country.”</p>
<p>Walz also said that farmers in Minnesota know climate change is real because some years they experience significant drought and other years they’re inundated with too much rain for their crops to handle.</p>
<p>“They’ve seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back-to-back,” Walz said. “But what they’re doing is adapting, and this has allowed them to tell me, ‘Look, I harvest corn, I harvest soybeans, and I harvest wind.’”</p>

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson pulled a six-month stopgap spending bill from heading to the floor for a vote Wednesday, scuttling efforts by the GOP to show solidarity behind their plan, which included a provision requiring ID to register to vote in federal elections.</p>
<p>The spending bill, released by House Republicans last week in the heat of a presidential campaign in which immigration is a central focus, had no chance of becoming law amid opposition from Democrats, a cool response from many GOP senators and a veto threat from the Biden administration.</p>
<p>A number of House GOP lawmakers had also come out against the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/9494/text" target="_blank">legislation</a>.</p>
<p>Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters that lawmakers plan to work through the weekend to find a path forward on the stopgap spending bill and language that would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote.</p>
<p>“No vote today because we are in the consensus-building business here in Congress; with a small majority, that’s what you do,” he said. “We’re having thoughtful conversations, family conversations within the Republican Conference and I believe we’ll get there.”</p>
<p>Johnson said Congress has “two primary obligations right now.”</p>
<p>One is funding the government ahead of the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, thereby avoiding a shutdown.</p>
<p>And he said the other is addressing concerns about the possibility that people who are not citizens could vote in the November election, even though that is already illegal.</p>
<p>“We’re going to continue to work on this. The whip is going to do the hard work and build consensus. We’re going to work through the weekend on that,” Johnson told reporters. “And I want any member of Congress, in either party, to explain to the American people why we should not ensure that only U.S. citizens are voting in U.S. elections.”</p>
<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-urges-shutdown-unless-congress-passes-bill-requiring-id-register-vote" target="_blank">posted on social media </a>Tuesday that Republicans should not vote for any short-term spending measure without the sidecar voter ID bill attached.</p>
<p>Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, called for a bipartisan negotiation after news broke of Johnson pulling the vote.</p>
<p>“For the good of the American people, Congress must move on from House Republicans’ partisan continuing resolution proposals and begin negotiating a funding bill that can earn the support of both Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>“It is past time for Chairman Tom Cole, Chair Patty Murray, Vice Chair Susan Collins, and I to begin good-faith negotiations on a continuing resolution that will keep government programs and services Americans depend on functioning while we complete our work on full-year funding bills before the end of the 118th Congress,” DeLauro added.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senators sound off</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Maine Sen. Collins, the top Republican on the spending panel, said she’d like to see a stopgap spending bill that lasts through mid-December to incentivize Congress to finish negotiations on the dozen annual government funding bills this calendar year.</p>
<p>Those talks were supposed to be wrapped up before the end of this month, but neither chamber has begun conference negotiations, leading to the need for the stopgap spending bills.</p>
<p>“I’ve made clear that I think we need to get our work done as soon as possible, and that the CR should not go beyond mid-December,” Collins said. “If it goes beyond mid-December, it places the new administration at a huge disadvantage, because they’re going to have to deal with issues that date back to October of this year, rather than focusing on the FY 26 budget, which I would think would be their preference.”</p>
<p>West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the top Republican on the Labor-HHS-Education spending subcommittee, said the Senate should wait a bit longer to see if the House can send over a bill, though not indefinitely.</p>
<p>“Obviously they have some struggles, which is not surprising,” she said of the House. “We’ll just wait. And if it gets to the point where it doesn’t look like they can act, then we may have to step in, but I wouldn’t say that’s the preferred path.”</p>
<p>Capito said that talks on the stopgap spending bills, which Congress enacts every year after missing their deadline, “have a tendency to fall into place much more quickly than what you might think.”</p>
<p>Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, chairman of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee, said he wants to see a stopgap spending bill that lasts until mid-December, citing concerns from the Department of Defense about a longer continuing resolution.</p>
<p>“Yeah, shit, I’d like to have the appropriations done by the end of September, but yeah, the shorter, the better,” he said.</p>
<p>Tester said he supports the legislation that would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote, but disagreed with House GOP leaders’ choice to attach it to the stopgap spending bill.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it should be on the appropriations bill. It just mucks things up,” Tester said. “Let’s take it to the floor and debate. I’ll vote for it, even though it’s not necessary.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he wasn’t surprised that Johnson had to pull the bill from the floor and encouraged him to draft a new stopgap spending bill that can garner the votes needed to clear the divided Congress.</p>
<p>“Speaker Johnson ought not bother with merely delaying his vote,” Schumer said. “He should scrap it — scrap his plan and start over.”</p>
<p>Schumer said that he, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and President Joe Biden would all “readily work” with Johnson on a bipartisan version.</p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved an updated COVID-19 vaccine intended to address severe symptoms of the virus ahead of the cold and flu season.</p>
<p>The new booster shots from Moderna and Pfizer follow a summer of increasing COVID-19 cases and are designed to better address the variants that are circulating now.</p>
<p>Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a written statement that vaccination “continues to be the cornerstone of COVID-19 prevention.”</p>
<p>“These updated vaccines meet the agency’s rigorous, scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality,” Marks said. “Given waning immunity of the population from previous exposure to the virus and from prior vaccination, we strongly encourage those who are eligible to consider receiving an updated COVID-19 vaccine to provide better protection against currently circulating variants.”</p>
<p>Wastewater surveillance has been <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#wastewater-surveillance" target="_blank">steadily increasing</a> since early May and could rise further now that children throughout the country are returning to school.</p>
<p>The number of emergency department <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#ed-visits_separated_by_age_group" target="_blank">visits</a> began increasing in May as well. And while the death rate from COVID-19 steadily decreased during the first half of the year, it began ticking up slightly in June, according to <a href="http://demographicsovertime/" target="_blank">data</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The FDA announcement said that three doses of the updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or two doses of the updated Moderna vaccine are approved for unvaccinated children between six months and 4 years old.</p>
<p>Children between six months and 4 years old who have already received their COVID-19 vaccine are eligible to receive one or two doses or either updated vaccine. The dosing will depend on the timing and number of doses of their previous vaccination.</p>
<p>Children between 5 and 11 years old can receive a single dose of the updated vaccine, regardless of whether they’ve been previously vaccinated or not. If a child in that age range has been vaccinated against COVID-19, they need to wait at least two months before getting the updated dose.</p>
<p>Anyone over the age of 12 is eligible for a single dose of the updated vaccine if they’ve been vaccinated previously. They also must wait at least two months after their last vaccination.</p>
<p>Pfizer wrote in a statement that its “vaccine will begin shipping immediately and be available in pharmacies, hospitals, and clinics across the U.S. beginning in the coming days.”</p>
<p>Moderna said it expects its updated vaccine “to be in pharmacies and care settings in the coming days.”</p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p>The Democratic National Convention held a ceremonial roll call of the states Tuesday, giving delegates on the floor of the United Center in Chicago a chance to show their support for Kamala Harris complete with corncob hats, DJ’d music, a surprise appearance from Atlanta rapper Lil Jon and enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>The tradition, which has long been part of presidential nominating conventions, was actually unnecessary this year. Democratic delegates <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kamala-harris-officially-becomes-democratic-presidential-nominee" target="_blank">voted virtually</a> earlier this month to formally make Harris their nominee ahead of ballot deadlines in several states.</p>
<p>Harris was the only person to qualify for the ballot after President Joe Biden decided to end his reelection bid in late July, following a pressure campaign from Democrats that began after a concerning debate performance.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s lively in-person “celebratory” vote, accompanied by a live DJ who played a different song for every state and territory, began with delegates from Biden’s home state of Delaware before Democrats in the remaining states and territories voiced their support for the Harris-Walz ticket.</p>
<p>It ended with unofficial votes being cast by delegates from Minnesota, home of vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, and those from Harris’ home state of California.</p>
<p>In between, people within the arena and watching on television heard why delegates believe Harris and Walz represent the best path forward for the country.</p>
<p>Hans Storvick, who said Walz is his neighbor and former teacher, told delegates during Minnesota’s turn to speak that the vice presidential nominee “opened our eyes to the world.”</p>
<p>“He taught us how to talk about global issues with respect, curiosity and kindness; even and especially when we disagreed,” Storvick said. “But he wasn’t just a great teacher, he was also a great neighbor and friend. In fact, when he was in the midst of a budget battle as governor of our state, he still found time to attend my brother’s funeral.”</p>
<p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who introduced himself as being from the “great state of Nancy Pelosi,” said residents there pride themselves “on our ability to live together and advance together and prosper together across every conceivable and imaginable difference.”</p>
<p>“But the thing we pride ourselves most on is that we believe the future happens in California first,” Newsom said as Kendrick Lamar played in the background. “And, Democrats, I’ve had the privilege for over 20 years to see that future taking shape with a star in an Alameda courtroom by the name of Kamala Harris.”</p>
<p>“I saw that star fighting for criminal justice, racial justice, economic justice, social justice,” he added. “I saw that star get even brighter as attorney general of California, as a United States senator and as Vice President of the United States of America.”</p>
<p>The Georgia delegation, though, might have upstaged all of their fellow Democrats by securing a <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1826072599153266776" target="_blank">mini performance</a> from Lil Jon, who sang “turn out for what” to the music of his famous “Turn Down For What” song before the state cast its votes for Harris.</p>
<p>When the nearly 80 minutes of ceremonial voting wrapped up the DNC displayed a live video of <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/08/20/harris-rallies-voters-in-milwaukee-on-second-night-of-dnc/" target="_blank">Harris at a campaign rally</a> at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the same venue where Republicans held their party convention just last month.</p>
<p>“We are so honored to be your nominees,” Harris said. “This is a people-powered campaign and together, we will chart a new way forward — a future for freedom, opportunity, of optimism and faith.”</p>

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris released her first detailed economic policy proposal Friday, laying out how she’d like to ease rent increases, boost first-time home buyers, end grocery price gouging and bolster the child tax credit.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign’s announcement said the proposals, most of which would need approval from Congress, would “address some of the sharpest pain points American families are confronting and bolster their financial security.”</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris has made clear that building up the middle class will be a defining goal of her presidency,” the announcement stated. “She will deliver for Americans who are demanding a new way forward towards a future that lifts up all Americans so that they can not just get by, but get ahead.”</p>
<p>Harris <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/harris-walz-campaign-launches-offices-in-rural-nc/" target="_blank">will campaign later Friday</a> in Raleigh, North Carolina, ahead of the Democratic National Convention beginning Monday, as both campaigns focus on a handful of swing states.</p>
<p>The economic plank of her plan seeks to curb the expenses that often come with building a family by expanding the child tax credit to the $3,600 per child that existed under the COVID-19 spending law that Democrats approved during the first months of the Biden administration. That provision has since expired.</p>
<p>Harris proposes increasing that credit to $6,000 for families that have children under a year old.</p>
<p>The maximum child tax credit is currently $2,000 per qualifying child for an individual making less than $200,000 annually or a couple filing jointly that makes less than $400,000.</p>
<p>There are several <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/child-tax-credit" target="_blank">qualifications</a> to receive a child tax credit, including that the child was under the age of 17 at the end of the year and that they are a U.S. citizen, U.S. national or U.S. resident alien.</p>
<p>The Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, would expand “to cover individuals and couples in lower-income jobs who aren’t raising a child in their home, cutting their taxes by up to $1,500,” according to the announcement.</p>
<p>Harris also pledged that no one making less than $400,000 annually would see an increase in new taxes, matching a promise that President Joe Biden has made throughout his time in the Oval Office.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Grocery price gouging</h4>

	
<p>The proposal says that if elected, Harris would seek Congress’ passage of a law to implement a ban on price gouging on groceries and other food as well as establish “rules of the road” that would bar companies from “excessive profits on food and groceries.”</p>
<p>Rising prices on groceries have been a major pain point for consumers, and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Thursday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/%C2%A0im-entitled-personal-attacks-against-harris-trump-asserts" target="_blank">made the case</a> that prices are too high for American families, laying the blame for inflation at the feet of the Biden-Harris administration and insisting he’s the only person able to get prices back down.</p>
<p>To implement her grocery gouging plan, Harris proposes providing the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general with new authority to “impose strict new penalties” on companies that price gouge.</p>
<p>“Many big grocery chains that have seen production costs level off have nevertheless kept prices high and have seen their highest profits in two decades,” the proposal states. “While some food companies have passed along these savings, others still have not.”</p>
<p>“Price fluctuations are normal in free markets, but Vice President Harris recognizes there is a big difference between fair pricing and the excessive prices unrelated to the costs of doing business that Americans have seen in the food and grocery industry,” it says.</p>
<p>A Harris administration would also address “unfair mergers and acquisitions” that can contribute to higher prices on food and groceries, the Harris plan says.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Expansion of drug pricing controls</h4>

	
<p>Harris hopes to expand a price ceiling for insulin that Democrats established in their signature climate change, health care and tax package known as the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA.</p>
<p>That section of the law, which only applies to Medicare,<a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/bd5568fa0e8a59c2225b2e0b93d5ae5b/aspe-insulin-affordibility-datapoint.pdf" target="_blank"> caps the price of insulin</a> per month at $35. Harris’ proposal looks to expand that to “everyone” while setting the maximum out-of-pocket cost for other prescriptions at $2,000.</p>
<p>The plan would increase the pace that Medicare is allowed to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris and Governor Walz will also work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and to help them avoid accumulating such debt in the future, because no one should go bankrupt just because they had the misfortune of becoming sick or hurt,” according to the proposal.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boosting home building</h4>

	
<p>The economic plan released Friday includes numerous changes that could ease the increasing costs of renting and purchasing a home for the first time.</p>
<p>Harris would seek to bolster home building throughout the country by 3 million units during the next four years by taking “down barriers that stand in the way of building new housing, including at the state and local levels.”</p>
<p>A Harris-Walz administration would call on Congress to create a tax incentive for construction companies that build “starter homes” that would then be sold to first-time home buyers.</p>
<p>The announcement says the new tax incentive would “complement the Neighborhood Homes Tax Credit that encourages investment in homes that would otherwise be too costly or difficult to develop or rehabilitate.”</p>
<p>Harris’ proposal calls for up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time home buyers who have paid rent on time for at least two years.</p>
<p>The proposal says that if implemented, the down payment financial aid would go out to more than 4 million people over four years.</p>
<p>Harris also pressed lawmakers to address the rising cost of rent by approving two bills that have been introduced in Congress, but haven’t gained any ground.</p>
<p>One <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2224" target="_blank">bill</a> would reduce the incentive for large firms to buy more than 50 single-family rental homes. The legislation would bar those companies “from deducting interest or depreciation on those properties,” according to a <a href="https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-colleagues-bill-crack-down-corporate-investors-buy-local-homes-housing-prices" target="_blank">summary</a> of the measure.</p>
<p>The second rental proposal asks Congress to approve a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3692" target="_blank">bill</a> that would “crack down on companies that help landlords increase rents in already high-priced markets,” according to a <a href="https://www.welch.senate.gov/welch-and-wyden-introduce-legislation-to-crack-down-on-companies-that-inflate-rents-with-price-fixing-algorithms/" target="_blank">summary</a>.</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris knows that our nation’s housing affordability crisis is making it hard for tens of millions of Americans to make ends meet while putting the American Dream of homeownership out of reach for too many working families,” the proposal states. “That’s why she will launch an urgent and comprehensive four-year plan to lower housing costs for working families and end America’s housing shortage.”</p>
<p>The Harris-Walz campaign also announced Friday that the ticket would<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/harris-and-walz-to-kick-off-pennsylvania-bus-tour-in-pittsburgh/" data-type="link" data-id="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/harris-and-walz-to-kick-off-pennsylvania-bus-tour-in-pittsburgh/" target="_blank"> hold a bus tour</a> in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the surrounding area on Sunday, just ahead of the Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>Harris; her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz; second gentleman Doug Emhoff; and first lady of Minnesota Gwen Walz will all participate in the tour of Allegheny and Beaver counties.</p>

The food items were props to illustrate his criticisms about the effects of inflation. (Photo by Adam Gray/Getty Images)</p><p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Thursday he sees no need to switch the tactics or tone of his bid for the White House now that Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee instead of President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Speaking during a press conference at his golf club in New Jersey, the former president began with 45 minutes of comments on a myriad of issues before he took more than a dozen questions from reporters.</p>
<p>Trump argued that there was no need to limit his personal criticism of Harris since there are several criminal trials ongoing against him and because she has called him “weird” several times.</p>
<p>“I think I’m entitled to personal attacks,” Trump said. “I don’t have a lot of respect for her. I don’t have a lot of respect for her intelligence. And I think she’ll be a terrible president.”</p>
<p>Numerous Republicans, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who challenged Trump for the nomination though she now says <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/nikki-haley-donald-trump/index.html" target="_blank">she will vote for him</a>, have called for Trump to focus more on the policy differences between the two political parties, and less on his personal grievances with Harris.</p>
<p>Trump, for example, sought to question Harris’ racial identity during his <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-insults-harris-makes-false-claims-quarrels-black-journalists-conference" target="_blank">panel interview</a> at the National Association of Black Journalists late last month.</p>
<p>Trump gave Thursday’s press conference outside and spoke while standing in between two tables of groceries and what appeared to be a large, blue doll house.</p>
<p>He used the props to make a case that prices are too high for American families, laying the blame for inflation at the feet of the Biden-Harris administration and insisting he’s the only person able to get prices back down.</p>
<p>Trump brushed aside his polling numbers in swing states, some of which have him trailing or inside the margin of error, in the match-up with Harris.</p>
<p>“I tend to poll low,” Trump said. “In some cases, really low.”</p>
<p>He also said that if reelected in November he hoped to develop a “friendly” relationship with Iran and to “get along” with China. The GOP has repeatedly criticized Democrats for being too lenient with both countries.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Another public meltdown’</h4>

	
<p>The Harris-Walz campaign released a mock advisory for the press conference before it began Thursday, writing in an email that Trump was preparing to “hold another public meltdown in Bedminster, New Jersey.”</p>
<p>“Not so fresh off NABJ, Florida, and Twitter glitches, Donald Trump intends to deliver another self-obsessed rant full of his own personal grievances to distract from his toxic Project 2025 agenda, unpopular running mate, and increasing detachment from the reality of the voters who will decide this election,” the campaign wrote. “These remarks will not be artificial intelligence, but they certainly will lack intelligence.”</p>
<p>Spokesperson James Singer released a written statement afterward that Trump “huffed and puffed his opposition to lowering food costs for middle and working class Americans and prescription drug costs for seniors before pivoting back to his usual lies and delusions.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Race remains in flux</h4>

	
<p>Despite the new momentum at the top of the Democratic presidential ticket and Trump insisting he’s on track to win, neither candidate yet has a clear path to victory this November, experts say.</p>
<p>The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, a nonpartisan publication that analyzes campaigns and rates whether races are leaning toward one political party or the other, has placed six states in its “toss-up” category for the Electoral College.</p>
<p>Arizona’s 11, Georgia’s 16, Michigan’s 15, Nevada’s six, Pennsylvania’s 19 and Wisconsin’s 10 Electoral College votes could go to either Harris or Trump when voting wraps up, according to the political publication’s <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/presidential-race-ratings" target="_blank">reporting</a>.</p>
<p>Minnesota, Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District and New Hampshire are all rated as leaning toward Harris with a total of 15 votes, while North Carolina and its 16 votes are leaning toward Trump.</p>
<p>All the other states are categorized as “solid” or “likely” going to either Trump or Harris, underlining the close nature of the campaign.</p>
<p>Walter told reporters on a call Thursday that Harris has a chance to sway swing voters during her speech to the Democratic National Convention next week.</p>
<p>“She has an opportunity here in that people are going to be more interested in watching this convention, certainly, than they were a month ago when Biden was on the top of the ticket,” she said. “And it’s an opportunity to speak beyond the Democratic base.”</p>
<p>The prime-time speech will give Harris a forum to address the major criticisms of her presidential run, including that she’s too liberal, isn’t the best person to handle the economy and that she’s weak on immigration policy, Walter said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump and his temperament</h4>

	
<p>Greg Strimple, president of GS Strategy Group, which is partnering with the Cook Political Report on a swing state project looking at voters’ views toward the candidates, said one of the bigger challenges for Trump’s campaign is getting the candidate to stay on message.</p>
<p>“This race has shifted from being a referendum on Biden’s age and economy to being a referendum on Trump and his temperament,” Strimple said on the call. “And despite the fact that Donald Trump is unable to get out of his way at the moment, his campaign is running ads that are right on message.”</p>
<p>If Trump and his campaign aligned to push their belief that Harris is “too liberal, too inexperienced and a continuation of Biden on the economy,” that could help them to regain ground in polling and with voters ahead of Election Day, he said.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of talk right now about the race being over, and I just kind of caution everyone that there is a path for Trump — it’s just whether he can take it,” Strimple said.</p>
<p>Patrick Toomey, a partner at BSG, which is also part of the swing state project, said on the call that voters shouldn’t rule out ups and downs in support for the candidates in the months ahead, citing potential upheaval from hurricane season or the ongoing wars in the Middle East.</p>
<p>“It’s just worth keeping in mind how many dramatic twists and turns there have been in this race so far,” Toomey said. “And the idea that because we’ve had this reset now things are set and nothing is going to change going forward, would be a mistake.”</p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The 2024 battle for control of Congress centers on just a handful of Senate races and about two dozen House seats, putting considerable pressure on those candidates to win over voters as party leaders and super PACs funnel millions of dollars into their campaigns.</p>
<p>The incumbents representing those states and congressional districts will spend nearly all of their time campaigning between now and Election Day, with Congress in session just three weeks ahead of Nov. 5. They’ll be fighting off challengers who will be on the home front the entire time.</p>
<p>Republicans aim to increase their slim majority in the House of Representatives and flip the Senate, while Democrats are hoping to hang onto their majority in the upper chamber and regain control of the House.</p>
<p>Experts interviewed by States Newsroom said the outcome will be determined by multiple factors, including turnout, ticket splitting and the trajectory of the presidential campaign, which underwent an abrupt change with the exit of President Joe Biden and the nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic candidate.</p>
<p>At stake is whether Harris or Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, faces a Congress friendly to their ambitions or another two years of a deeply divided government in the nation’s capital. Biden has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-limps-toward-end-disappointing-session-just-78-laws-show" target="_blank">struggled with</a> a GOP House and a Senate narrowly controlled by Democrats during the past two years.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of energy on both sides for these congressional races, because of just how close the margins are going to be in the House and Senate,” said Casey Burgat, assistant professor and legislative affairs program director at George Washington University.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate GOP control?</h4>

	
<p>The Senate is trending toward a Republican majority, though that will be determined by voters in Michigan, Montana, Nevada and Ohio, all of which are considered toss-ups by the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, a respected non-partisan publication.</p>
<p>If the GOP picks up any one of those four seats, that would give Republicans at least a 51-seat majority in the chamber after winning the West Virginia seat that’s currently held by Joe Manchin III, thought to be nearly certain in the GOP-dominated state.</p>
<figure id="attachment_39057" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:383px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_2188/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-39057 " src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="383" height="255" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2188-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger&#8217;s decision to run for governor leaves her 7th Congressional seat open but the district leans blue, political forecasters say. (Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>Democrats maintaining those four seats as well as three others classified as “lean Democrat” by the Cook Political Report would leave control of a 50-50 Senate to the results of the presidential election, since the vice president casts tie-breaking votes in that chamber.</p>
<p>The Senate map is highly favorable to Republicans, who are defending 11 seats in safely red states, while Democrats are trying to hold on to 23 seats, with seven of those in purple states.</p>
<p>While the entire 435-member House of Representatives is up for reelection every two years, senators are elected to six-year terms, leaving about one-third of the chamber up for reelection in evenly numbered years.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Eyes on Montana</h4>

	
<p>Robert Saldin, professor of political science at the University of Montana, said during an interview that Democratic Sen. Jon Tester will need to get voters in the state who support Trump to split their tickets if Tester is going to secure reelection.</p>
<p>“One of the secrets to Tester’s success over the years is that he has been able to distinguish himself from stereotypes of the national Democratic Party,” Saldin said. “And that’s going to be really important again, obviously, because Trump is on the ticket, and is certainly going to carry the state by a very wide margin.”</p>
<p>Republican challenger Tim Sheehy could potentially have a bit of an easier time getting elected this November in the deeply Republican state, he said.</p>
<p>“All he has to do is get people who are voting for Trump to also vote for him. And in fact, he can probably lose some tens of thousands of voters and still be okay,” Saldin said.</p>
<p>Sheehy, however, is somewhat disadvantaged by not having run in a competitive GOP primary, leaving him to move directly into a high-stakes general election.</p>
<p>“He is a political novice,” Saldin said. “He didn’t have a practice run in the primary. And here he is fresh out of the gate in one of the most expensive, most watched, most hyped Senate elections in the country. And so he’s having to learn as he goes.”</p>
<p>One factor that could benefit Tester over Sheehy is <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2024/08/02/gianforte-revives-debunked-abortion-claim-for-ballot-initiative/" target="_blank">a ballot question addressing abortion access</a> in the state that is likely to go before voters in November, Saldin said.</p>
<p>“That should give at least a little nudge in the direction of the Democrats,” Saldin said.</p>
<p>A dozen other states have approved or could approve <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/dashboard/ballot-tracker-status-of-abortion-related-state-constitutional-amendment-measures/" target="_blank">abortion ballot questions</a>, including Arizona, Florida, Maryland and Nevada.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In Ohio, edging away from national politics</h4>

	
<p>Paul A. Beck, academy professor of political science at The Ohio State University, said Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown has sought to separate himself from national political figures throughout this reelection bid.</p>
<p>“I think he really wants to make this a local contest, a statewide contest, not a national contest,” Beck said. “And so he’s going to do everything he can to not appear on the stage with the Democratic nominees for president, and everything he can to try to define himself as somebody who is above partisan politics.”</p>
<p>Brown was elected to the House in 1992 before winning election to the Senate in 2006. He secured reelection in 2012 and 2018, though Republican candidate Bernie Moreno is looking to end that streak this year.</p>
<p>Beck said <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/08/05/who-is-funding-ohios-redistricting-amendment/" target="_blank">a ballot question about redistricting</a> could help boost turnout, potentially increasing Brown’s chances.</p>
<p>“It’s going to energize voters and is going to produce higher turnout on the left than it will on the right, and that could be a factor in 2024,” Beck said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Incumbent clout</h4>

	
<p>Sitting members of Congress have historically held an advantage that may help the party that holds more members seeking to return to Capitol Hill for the 119th Congress.</p>
<p>“Reelection rates in the House have never dropped below 85%, and have recently stretched to highs of 98% in 2004 and 97% in 2016,” according to <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2023/10/incumbent-politicians-enjoy-record-reelection-in-aging-congress/" target="_blank">analysis</a> from Miro Hall-Jones at OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan organization that reports on the role of money in U.S. politics. “While the Senate is more susceptible to shifts in public opinion — reelection rates dropped as low as 50% in 1980 at the dawn of the Reagan Revolution — incumbent senators have retained their seats in 88% of races since 1990.”</p>
<p>Every single one of the 28 senators seeking reelection two years ago was able to convince voters in their home states to give them another term, marking the first time that has happened in American history, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>Michigan and Arizona Senate races could then present a bigger challenge for Democrats, since both those seats are open due to the upcoming retirements of Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow and Arizona independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.</p>
<p>Michigan is currently rated as a toss-up by the Cook Political Report while Arizona is rated as “lean Democrat.”</p>
<p>In the House, the 11 seats held by Republicans and considered by the Cook Political Report <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank">to be toss-ups</a> all are held by an incumbent seeking reelection, while two of the Democrats’ 11 toss-up seats are open.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House majority</h4>

	
<p>The contest for who controls the House after November is “razor thin,” said Burgat from George Washington University. With Republicans holding on by a slim margin, Democrats only need a net gain of four seats to capture the majority.</p>
<p>“Whether it goes Democratic or Republican, it’s not going to be by much,” Burgat said.</p>
<p>While Democrats and Republicans will focus much of their attention on the 22 toss-up races, they’ll also be funneling resources toward the campaigns that are rated as only leaning in their direction, as opposed to being likely or solid seats.</p>
<p>The Cook Political Report has eight seats held by GOP lawmakers as leaning in Republicans’ favor while 14 races, all Democratic-held seats except one, are in districts that “lean Democrat.”</p>
<p>That makes a total of about 44 competitive House races, according to the Cook Political Report’s analysis.</p>
<p>Among the closely watched congressional districts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both parties are eyeing open seats in California, Colorado, Michigan and Virginia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Michigan’s 7th and 8th districts, now held, respectively, by Democrats Elissa Slotkin, who is seeking the state’s open Senate seat, and the retiring Dan Kildee, are rated by the Cook Political Report as toss-ups.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, being vacated by Democrat Abigail Spanberger, who will focus on a run for governor, is expected to lean blue.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>California Democratic Rep. Katie Porter’s district also leans towards Democrats. Porter decided to leave the seat for an unsuccessful Senate run.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Colorado’s 3rd, abandoned by Republican Lauren Boebert, who shifted to a friendlier district, leans Republican, according to the Cook Political Report.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One open seat each in Maryland and New Hampshire is rated as likely Democrat by the prognosticator.</li>
</ul>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">DCCC ads</h4>

	
<p>The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is throwing big money where races are competitive, zeroing in on 15 media markets including those in Arizona, Colorado, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The official campaign arm of House Democrats <a href="https://dccc.org/dccc-ie-reserves-28-million-in-first-round-of-tv-and-digital-ads-for-2024-cycle/" target="_blank">announced</a> a $28 million initial ad buy in June, spending double on digital ads compared to 2022, according to the organization.</p>
<p>The DCCC maintains that House Democrats “have always had multiple paths to reclaim the majority in November — including our 27 Red to Blue candidates in districts across the country working to defeat extreme Republicans who are out-of-touch with their communities,” spokesperson Viet Shelton told States Newsroom in a written statement.</p>
<p>Shelton said voters are “fed up with these politicians who are more interested in obeying Trump, voting for abortion bans, and giving tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations, while ignoring the needs of the middle class.”</p>
<p>The DCCC sees pickup opportunities in the 16 districts Biden won in 2020 that are currently held by Republicans.</p>
<p>Among them are five seats in California, four in New York, two in Arizona, and one each in New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Nebraska also saw incumbent GOP Rep. Don Bacon’s district go to Biden.</p>
<p>The switch to Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket could boost challengers in heavily college-educated districts, according to the Cook Political Report’s latest analysis of the field.</p>
<p>Those include Arizona’s 1st Congressional District held by GOP Rep. David Schweikert, New Jersey’s 7th occupied by freshman Thomas Kean Jr., and New York’s 17th held by Mike Lawler, also in his first term. All are rated as Republican toss-ups by the Cook Political Report.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Frontline candidates</h4>

	
<p>But the DCCC campaign has vulnerable Democratic incumbents to worry about as well. The organization has identified 31 as “frontline” members, meaning their purple districts are what campaigners describe as “in play.”</p>
<p>Among them is 40-year Democrat Marcy Kaptur, who has held Ohio’s 9th Congressional District, in the state’s northwest region, since 1983.</p>
<p>Other vulnerable Democrats include Reps. Yadira Caraveo in Colorado’s 8th, Jared Golden in Maine’s 2nd, Don Davis in North Carolina’s 1st, Gabe Vasquez in New Mexico’s 2nd, Emilia Sykes in Ohio’s 13th, Susan Wild and Matt Cartwright in Pennsylvania’s 7th and 8th districts, and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez in Washington’s 3rd.</p>
<p>The National Republican Congressional Committee did not respond to requests for comment, but the House GOP campaign arm <a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2024/06/27/nrcc-ie-reserves-45-7-million-in-first-round-of-ad-reservations-to-grow-the-house-majority/" target="_blank">announced</a> in late June a $45.7 million initial ad buy across 29 media markets, with large chunks going to metro areas in Los Angeles; New York City; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Anchorage, Alaska; Denver, Colorado; Detroit, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; and Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p>The ad buy — an offensive “to grow our majority,” NRCC Chair Richard Hudson said in a press release — will specifically target 13 districts currently held by Democrats.</p>

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to embark on a year-long study beginning next month that will test samples for evidence of highly pathogenic avian influenza from former dairy cattle moved into meat production.</p>
<p>Emilio Esteban, the under secretary for food safety at the USDA, told reporters on a call Tuesday the new testing program follows three studies undertaken during the spring and summer that all found beef in the nation’s food supply is safe to eat.</p>
<p>“However, we want to move forward with an additional step,” Esteban said. “And what this means is that when those carcasses are tested, they are held and are not going to go into commerce until we get the results back.”</p>
<p>The virus, also referred to as bird flu or H5N1, has been found in wild bird and domestic poultry flocks within the United States for years. But the ongoing outbreak in dairy cattle has forced animal and human health experts to establish testing for a new community of agriculture workers and livestock.</p>
<p>The news of additional testing for the country’s meat supply came alongside the results of a study from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that reinforced the safety of pasteurized dairy products.</p>
<p>Steve Grube, chief medical officer for the FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said that the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/updates-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai#secondtesting" target="_blank">most recent round of dairy product testing</a> included 167 foods that were processed in 27 states in June and July.</p>
<p>“None of the product samples contained viable H5N1, reaffirming that pasteurization is effective,” he said. “The second survey was intended to address geographic and product gaps from the initial sampling of the commercial milk and dairy product supply that the FDA conducted during April and May.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Testing milk in bulk tanks</h4>

	
<p>Federal officials have also launched a voluntary program for farmers to test the milk in bulk tanks for H5N1, a step that’s intended to make it easier for them to move their cows between states without having to individually test each one.</p>
<p>Eric Deeble, deputy under secretary for marketing and regulatory programs at USDA, said the department’s Farm Service Agency has approved 23 of the 35 applications it has received so far to help ease the financial burden on dairy farmers who take their herds out of production after testing positive.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/disaster-assistance-program/emergency-assist-for-livestock-honey-bees-fish/index" target="_blank">program</a> — known as Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-raised Fish — has approved more than $1 million in payments.</p>
<p>The price paid to farmers is based on a formula that includes the price of milk from the preceding month as well as the number of dairy cattle that contract H5N1.</p>
<p>Deeble said on the call with reporters that of the approved applications, a dozen are from Colorado, which has seen a sharp increase in the number of positive H5N1 tests within its dairy industry.</p>
<p>Deeble argued the uptick is due to certain factors within the state and cautioned people against assuming that if testing was increased in other areas of the country, the number of positive H5N1 tests for dairy cattle would spike.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that it is accurate necessarily to extrapolate from the situation in Weld County, Colorado,” Deeble said. “Weld County and Colorado dairy in particular is rather unique in the degree to which the dairies are all closely associated with one another; both spatially and the way in which there is a lot of movement between the facilities.”</p>
<p>“It is a tightly integrated dairy community that’s isolated from much of the rest of the state, and there is a lot of connectivity between the premises in the way in which they use vehicles, support services, milk trucks,” Deeble added.</p>
<p>During the last 30 days, five states have had dairy cattle test positive for H5N1, including Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota and Texas.</p>
<p>Colorado holds a disproportionate number of cases with 26 of the <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/hpai-confirmed-cases-livestock" target="_blank">dairy herds to test positive</a>, while the other four states combined hold a total of six herds.</p>
<p>Other mammals <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/mammals" target="_blank">diagnosed</a> with H5N1 during the last six weeks are overwhelmingly in Colorado, which has found the virus in house mice, deer mice, domestic cats, a desert cottontail and a prairie vole.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Effect on cats</h4>

	
<p>Public health officials said during the call Tuesday they are beginning to look more closely at when and why cats are being affected by the spread of H5N1.</p>
<p>Barn cats as well as those that hunt outside, coming into regular contact with wild birds that hold a reservoir of H5N1, have tested positive for the virus before.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://www.colovma.org/cvma-news/influenza-a-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-h5n1-in-domestic-cats/" target="_blank">report</a> from the Colorado Veterinary Medical Association earlier this month noted that two of the six cats diagnosed with H5N1 in that state this year “were indoor only cats with no direct exposures to the virus.”</p>
<p>Public health officials on the call were unable to answer a question about how indoor-only cats would have come into contact with H5N1.</p>
<p>Experts on the call cautioned that as fall approaches, wild birds will begin migrating and dairy farmers will likely ship their cattle at higher rates, both of which could lead to an uptick in the number of positive cases of H5N1 being reported in dairy cattle as well as other animals.</p>

The president addressed reasons for abruptly ending his run for a second term after initially rejecting calls from some top Democrats to do so, and outlined what he hopes to accomplish in his remaining months in office. (Photo by Evan Vucci-Pool/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden explained his decision not to seek reelection during a prime-time address from the Oval Office on Wednesday, saying now is the time to turn over power to the next generation.</p>
<p>“I’ve made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point — one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come,” Biden said. “America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division.”</p>
<p>The 11-minute speech was the first time Biden spoke at length on camera since releasing a letter Sunday withdrawing as the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee. He will continue to serve out his term.</p>
<p>Biden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who has received support from enough delegates to clinch the party’s official nomination during <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-approve-virtual-vote-delegates-pick-presidential-nominee" target="_blank">a virtual roll call vote slated for early August.</a></p>
<p>Biden called into a campaign rally earlier this week, but had only given off-camera or brief remarks since announcing his decision to step aside while sidelined with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Calls for Biden to bow out began after his performance during the first presidential debate on June 27 raised significant concerns among Democrats and others about his age and cognitive abilities.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Speaking directly to Americans in his address, Biden said he believed his record, leadership and vision for the country’s future “all merited a second term.”</p>
<p>“But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy and that includes personal ambition,” Biden said. “So I’ve decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That’s the best way to unite our nation.”</p>
<p>Biden said that while there is “a time and a place for long years of experience in public life,” there is also a time for “younger voices.”</p>
<p>“And that time and place is now,” Biden said.</p>
<p>During his remaining six months in office, Biden said he planned to continue pressing for gun control, reproductive rights, voting rights and an end to all forms of violence, including political.</p>
<p>Biden said he wanted to secure an end to the war in Gaza and bring home the hostages that Hamas took when it attacked Israel on Oct. 7.</p>
<p>He said he planned to press for changes to the Supreme Court, calling it essential for democracy.</p>
<p>Biden also recounted the numerous laws enacted since he became president as well as his efforts to hold the NATO alliance together following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>He said he hoped Americans understood how “grateful” he was for his decades as an elected official.</p>
<p>“I ran for president four years ago because I believed, and I still do, that the soul of America was at stake, the very nature of who we are was at stake,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Harris, he said, has the experience, strength and capability to lead the country following the November elections.</p>
<p>“The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule — the people do,” Biden said. “History is in your hands, the power is in your hands, the idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep the faith and remember who we are.”</p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p>MILWAUKEE — Donald Trump in an unusual speech accepting the GOP presidential nomination Thursday at the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention gave a detailed account about the attempt on his life last weekend when a gunman shot at him during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“I will tell you exactly what happened. And you’ll never hear it from me a second time because it’s actually too painful to tell,” Trump said in his first public remarks about the shooting that killed one rally goer and injured two others. The gunman was killed by law enforcement at the scene.</p>
<p>Turning his head to look at a chart, which was later displayed on multiple screens inside the Fiserv Forum, is what saved his life, Trump said.</p>
<p>“I heard a loud whizzing sound and felt something hit me really, really hard on my right ear,” Trump recalled. “I said to myself, ‘Wow, what was that? It can only be a bullet.’ I moved my hand to my right ear, brought it down, and my hand was covered with blood.”</p>
<p>Trump said he knew immediately that he was “under attack” and praised the Secret Service agents for rushing on stage to shield him with their own bodies, calling them “great people” who took “great risk,” to applause from the crowd.</p>
<p>He thanked the supporters in attendance last weekend for not panicking and stampeding, which can cause injuries and deaths during a mass shooting.</p>
<p>Trump in his 90-minute remarks appeared to seriously reflect on how close he came to being killed at one point, commenting that he wasn’t sure he was meant to survive the attack.</p>
<p>“I’m not supposed to be here tonight,” Trump said, before the crowd began chanting, “Yes, you are!”</p>
<p>“I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God,” he added.</p>
<p>Republicans’ bestowal of the nomination on Trump at the finale of their convention is significant in that he becomes the first convicted felon to accept a major political party’s presidential nod. Trump still faces charges in multiple criminal cases after one of the cases was dropped earlier this week.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Divine intervention seen</h4>

	
<p>Trump’s comments about being saved by God followed days of politicians from throughout the country claiming the bullet only grazing his ear was an act of divine intervention.</p>
<p>Pastor Lorenzo Sewell, from Detroit, said earlier in the night that people “can’t deny the power of God” in Trump’s life.</p>
<p>“You can’t deny that God protected him, you cannot deny that it was a millimeter miracle that was able to save this man’s life,” Sewell said. “Could it be that Jesus Christ preserved him for such a time as this?”</p>
<p>“Could it be that the King of Glory, the Lord God, strong and mighty, the God who is mighty in battle, protected Donald Trump, because he wants to use him for such a time as this?” Sewell added.</p>
<p>Tucker Carlson, former Fox News television personality and conservative pundit, said that “a lot of people” are wondering what’s going on following the shooting on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Something bigger is going on here. I think people who don’t even believe in God are starting to think, ‘Well, maybe there’s something to this,’” Carlson said. “And I’m starting to think it’s going to be okay, actually.”</p>
<p>Trump wore a white bandage on his right ear concealing the wound he received <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">last Saturday before Secret Service agents rushed to shield him</a> from bullets.</p>
<p>Trump spoke about Corey Comperatore, a former fire chief attending the rally with his family, who was <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-assassination-attempt-on-trump-at-butler-rally/" target="_blank">killed in the shooting</a> as well as the two people who were injured.</p>
<p>Trump called Comperatore a “highly respected” fire chief before walking over to his fire jacket and helmet, which had been placed on the stage, and kissing the helmet in a solemn moment.</p>
<p>Trump said he spoke with Comperatore’s wife as well as the two injured people earlier in the day, who were doing “very well” in recovering from their injuries. The convention then observed a moment of silence for Comperatore.</p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP seeks unity as Democrats debate Biden’s fate</h4>

	
<p>The Republican National Convention and Trump’s acceptance speech provided a prime opportunity for the GOP to show unity as Democrats <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/california-rep-schiff-latest-democrat-call-biden-drop-out" target="_blank">increasingly questioned</a> whether President Joe Biden should formally become their nominee in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Trump repeatedly criticized Democrats’ policies and said they were a threat to the country’s future, though he only mentioned Biden once, saying the damage the current president could inflict on the country is “unthinkable.”</p>
<p>“If you took the 10 worst presidents in the history of the United States… and added them up, they will not have done the damage that Biden has done,” Trump said.</p>
<p>Voters, he said, must “rescue our nation from failed and even incompetent leadership” by voting for him and Republicans during November’s election.</p>
<p>“This will be the most important election in the history of our country,” Trump said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘The stakes have never been higher,’ Biden campaign says</h4>

	
<p>Biden-Harris Campaign Chair Jen O’Malley Dillon released a written statement rebuking Trump’s speech, saying he “rambled on for well over an hour.”</p>
<p>“He failed to mention how he had inflicted pain and cruelty on the women of America by overturning Roe v Wade. He failed to mention his plan to take over the civil service and to pardon the January 6th insurrectionists,” Dillon wrote.</p>
<p>Biden, on the other hand, is “running for an America where we defend democracy, not diminish it,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“The stakes have never been higher,” Dillon wrote. “The choice has never been more clear. President Biden is more determined than ever to defeat Donald Trump and his Project 2025 agenda in November.”</p>
<p>DNC Chair Jaime Harrison said in a written statement that in “Trump’s Republican Party, there’s only space for unquestioning loyalists who will put him above our democracy, above our freedoms, and above working families.”</p>
<p>“Over the past four days, we’ve seen speakers endorse a far-right, dangerous vision that would see Americans’ basic liberties stripped away and replace the rule of law with the rule of Trump,” Harrison wrote. “No amount of desperate spin can change how unpopular and out of touch their disastrous plans are for the American people.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No stain left by Jan. 6</h4>

	
<p>Trump’s speech solidified a significant turnaround for the former president, who earned rebukes from many of the party’s leaders following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>The events of that day, which led to the deaths of police officers and ended the country’s centuries-long peaceful transition of power, would traditionally have been viewed as a black spot by the party that lauds itself as supporting “law and order” as well as the country’s founding principles.</p>
<p>Instead, Trump has succeeded in convincing his supporters that the people convicted for violent acts should be pardoned as “political prisoners” and the several court cases against him are about his politics and not his actions.</p>
<p>Top Trump campaign official Chris LaCivita <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/top-trump-adviser-says-2024-election-not-over-until-inauguration-day" target="_blank">refused</a> to say earlier Thursday during an event near the RNC whether Trump would continue to campaign on the promise to pardon Jan. 6 defendants, or “hostages” as he has described them numerous times.</p>
<p>Trump said Thursday night that nothing would prevent him from becoming president following November’s election.</p>
<p>“Our resolve is unbroken and our purpose is unchanged — to deliver a government that serves the American people better than ever before,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“Nothing will stop me to this vision, because our vision is righteous and our cause is pure,” Trump added. “No matter what obstacle comes our way, we will not break, we will not bend, we will not back down and I will never stop fighting for you.”</p>
<p>Trump’s loss of the popular vote and the Electoral College four years ago led him to make false claims about election fraud, which never bore fruit. Judges threw out numerous court challenges.</p>
<p>Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fueled-lies-trump-charged-seeking-overturn-2020-election-6" target="_blank">faces federal felony charges</a> that he conspired to create false slates of electors in seven states and attempted to obstruct the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.</p>
<p>That, however, hasn’t stopped Trump from repeating the claim and making it a hallmark of his third run for the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Trump reiterated many of those incorrect claims during his speech to applause and cheers from the crowd gathered inside Fiserv Forum.</p>
<p>“They used COVID to cheat,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump: ‘We must not criminalize dissent’</h4>

	
<p>Despite his incessant encouragement of rally chants during the 2016 campaign to lock up former Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, and a  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-floats-imprisoning-political-opponents-rcna155543" target="_blank">willingness</a> to explore jailing his rivals if he wins in November, Trump said “we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement.”</p>
<p>In addition to the federal 2020 election subversion charges, Trump faces racketeering charges in Georgia, sentencing over a guilty verdict in New York, and federal charges over allegedly stealing and hiding classified government documents after leaving the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Federal District Judge Aileen Cannon on Monday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-dismisses-trump-classified-documents-criminal-case" target="_blank">dropped</a> the classified documents case on the grounds that the government illegally appointed a special counsel to prosecute it. The Department of Justice has since appealed.</p>
<p>The former president reminded the crowd of the “major ruling that was handed down from a highly respected federal judge.”</p>
<p>“If the Democrats want to unify our country, they should drop these partisan witch hunts,” Trump said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Stop wars with a telephone call’</h4>

	
<p>Trump said the “planet is teetering on the edge of World War Three” and he will “end every single international crisis that the current administration has created.”</p>
<p>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 “would have never happened if I was president,” he said, repeating the same claim about the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.</p>
<p>“I tell you this, we want our hostages back and they better be back,” Trump said later in the speech about Israeli-American hostages still in Hamas captivity.</p>
<p>Trump praised Victor Orbán — the Hungarian prime minister known for his authoritarian streak — which the crowd cheered. He also touted his friendship with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>He said the press criticized him for his congeniality with Kim, but “it’s nice to get along with someone who has a lot of nuclear weapons,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“I could stop wars with a telephone call,” Trump said, but immediately followed with a promise to “build an Iron Dome missile defense system to ensure that no enemy can strike our homeland.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s ‘only crime’ is ‘loving America’</h4>

	
<p>Speakers rallying the crowd before Trump’s appearance on Thursday exalted his golf game and business management style, and defended the former president, who they say supports them through long-established ties.</p>
<p>“To me, he is my friend,” Trump’s attorney Alina Habba said tearfully.</p>
<p>“Sham indictments and baseless allegations will not deter us, because the only crime President Trump has committed is loving America,” she said.</p>
<p>Trump’s 2020 election subversion case has sat in a holding pattern for months while he appealed his claim of presidential immunity to the U.S. Supreme Court. The justices returned the case to the trial court after <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/presidential-immunity-covers-some-official-acts-supreme-court-rules-trump-case" target="_blank">issuing</a> a 6-3 majority opinion in early July that grants broad immunity for former presidents’ official acts.</p>
<p>Trump was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">convicted</a> of 34 felonies in New York state court for falsifying business records related to a hush money payment by his personal lawyer to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.</p>
<p>However, the New York judge handling the case has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-ny-sentencing-delayed-after-us-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-ruling-3" target="_blank">delayed</a> Trump’s sentencing while his lawyers challenge the case, arguing the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling opens questions about what evidence against a former sitting president can be admitted to court.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pompeo says no Putin in Ukraine under Trump</h4>

	
<p>Mike Pompeo, Trump’s former CIA director and secretary of State, blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and deaths of its civilians on “weakness” of the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“Last week, we saw what it meant — that Children’s Hospital bombed, innocents killed — it did not have to be,” Pompeo said, referring to the July 8 Russian <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/08/nx-s1-5033075/russia-ukraine-war-missile-strike-childrens-hospital-kyiv" target="_blank">strike</a> on the medical facility in Kyiv.</p>
<p>World leaders from NATO etched a path for Ukraine to join the alliance at the July summit in Washington, D.C, and pledged more resources for the nation that Russia further invaded in February 2022.</p>
<p>Trump has long criticized NATO, dismissing the post-WWII alliance’s core tenet that an attack against one is an attack against all and threatening to withdraw over funding.</p>
<p>In February he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nato-trump-delinquent-defense-allies-c1f7de696ff6ca06e4088f49b93122e1" target="_blank">told</a> a rally crowd in South Carolina that he would “encourage (Russia) to do whatever the hell they want” to “delinquent” member countries that do not pay 2% of their GDP on defense.</p>
<p>All members agreed to a 2% commitment in 2014, and 23 are <a href="https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm" target="_blank">on track</a> to meet the target this year, according to the alliance.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night at the RNC, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ohios-jd-vance-pitches-swing-state-votes-accepting-nod-trump-vp-0" target="_blank">echoed</a> Trump’s words and declared “no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer.”</p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>MILWAUKEE — Republicans speaking at a concealed carry event on Tuesday, just days after a gunman attempted to kill their presidential nominee, insisted the party won’t change its stance on Second Amendment rights.</p>
<p>Attendees at the one-hour session, hosted by the U.S. Concealed Carry Association near the Republican National Convention, weren’t actually able to conceal carry any firearms, since it was held inside a Secret Service security checkpoint.</p>
<p>But those in attendance heard from Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita and three members of Congress about what the plans will be for gun rights should they sweep Congress and the White House during November’s elections.</p>
<p>“I think what we’ll see is a continuation of supporting and defending the Second Amendment and where that really comes into play is the judiciary, the appointment of judges,” LaCivita said. “And so that is clearly, you know, one of the largest impacts that President Trump had clearly during his first term was a remake of the judiciary.”</p>
<p>Florida U.S. Rep. Kat Cammack, speaking with reporters after the event, said that the GOP was “absolutely not” considering changing its support for Second Amendment rights. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Saturday was injured by a gunman at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. One person was killed and two others were injured. The shooter was killed at the scene.</p>
<p>“I stand 1,000% convicted in the fact that the Republican Party will always stand for the Constitution and the Second Amendment and our right to bear arms,” Cammack said. “One deranged individual, who clearly needed help, he is not going to change the United States Constitution and our right as Americans to bear arms. Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>Cammack said it is “shocking” and “inappropriate” for any lawmaker to call for changes to gun laws in the wake of “tragic events” like mass shootings. She criticized Democrats for not making similar comments following the Trump shooting.</p>
<p>“The thing that has been really shocking to me, is you see right after tragic events, many politicians and pundits come out and they say, ‘This is the time to have the discussion about gun control’ when clearly… that’s not appropriate,” she said.</p>
<p>“In this case, I have gone through and seen the messaging of some of my colleagues, and I don’t see those same calls for gun control in the aftermath of this incident,” Cammack added. “So it makes me think that there’s a bit of a disingenuous attitude on some of the remarks that they’ve been making.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hunters, gun owners</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During the panel discussion, Cammack said Republicans need to talk to the 10 million hunters and gun owners throughout the country who are not registered to vote to ensure they change that and go to the polls in November.</p>
<p>“That is a missed opportunity for us as 2A advocates to make sure that we are actually doing the work to secure that victory, because we cannot turn the corner into January and start talking about how we’re going to do national reciprocity, if we don’t have the votes,” Cammack said.</p>
<p>A nationwide concealed carry reciprocity law would likely require a state with stricter concealed carry laws to recognize an out-of-state concealed carry permit.</p>
<p>USCCA writes on its website that “(r)eciprocity simply means a concealed carry permit or license is valid beyond the issuing state.”</p>
<p>“States may have full reciprocity, recognizing all out-of-state permits, or partial reciprocity, specifying agreements with select states,” the website states, referring to state-level laws. “The negotiation and recognition of these agreements depend on the willingness of states to cooperate. Whatever the agreement, carriers must follow the laws of the state in which they are carrying, and those may be different from the issuing state. “</p>
<p>Wisconsin U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald said during the panel that gun rights advocates must pay close attention to lawmakers at the state and federal level, since changes to gun ownership laws are generally incremental and not sweeping.</p>
<p>“I think that, you know, we have to be diligent as legislators that protect the Second Amendment to say, ‘No, wait a minute, you know, this is a constitutional guarantee right,’” Fitzgerald said. “So you can continue to pass bill after bill after bill with some cute type of name that would lead people to believe that it’s about security. But we have to be diligent.”</p>

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Thousands of Republicans will gather in Milwaukee beginning Monday for the party’s presidential nominating convention — a typically joyous occasion that will likely take on a different tone this year after a gunman shot at Donald Trump, injuring him, on Saturday.</p>
<p>Trump, who will be formally nominated as the GOP’s presidential nominee on Thursday, still plans to attend the convention and officials stress the four-day event will go on as normal.</p>
<p>The shooting at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania is being i<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/fbi-identifies-shooter-in-assassination-attempt-on-trump-at-butler-rally/" target="_blank">nvestigated as an attempted assassination</a> and the FBI identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pa. The U.S. Secret Service “neutralized the shooter, who is now deceased,” the Secret Service said.</p>
<p>Trump, who has been declared “safe” by the Secret Service, posted on social media Sunday morning that he was still looking “forward to speaking to our Great Nation this week from Wisconsin.”</p>
<p>“Thank you to everyone for your thoughts and prayers yesterday, as it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening,” Trump wrote. “We will FEAR NOT, but instead remain resilient in our Faith and Defiant in the face of Wickedness. Our love goes out to the other victims and their families. We pray for the recovery of those who were wounded, and hold in our hearts the memory of the citizen who was so horribly killed. In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win.”</p>
<p>Senior advisors to the Trump campaign Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita released a statement hours after the shooting on Saturday to say that the former president wasn’t changing his plans.</p>
<p>“President Trump looks forward to joining you all in Milwaukee as we proceed with our convention to nominate him to serve as the 47th President of the United States,” Wiles and LaCivita wrote in a joint statement. “As our party’s nominee, President Trump will continue to share his vision to Make America Great Again.”</p>
<p>Reince Priebus, chairman of the MKE 2024 Host Committee, said in a separate statement that he was “heartbroken that reports indicate that at least one innocent person has been killed and perhaps others have been injured. This horrific violence has no place in America.”</p>
<p>“Guests have already begun to arrive in Wisconsin, and we look forward to working with the Republican National Committee to welcome everyone to Milwaukee this week,” Priebus added.</p>
<p>Political party conventions are designated as National Special Security Events, or NSSEs, and come with extremely heightened security compared to a typical campaign rally.</p>
<p>The Secret Service will have at least two security perimeters around the Fiserv Forum in downtown Milwaukee and the city itself will be swarming with additional federal, state and local law enforcement officers.</p>
<p>The convention will still host speeches throughout the week and the dozens of side events hosted by state Republican Parties and conservative organizations were still expected to continue, though likely with a more somber mood than was planned before the shooting.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP platform</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Party conventions have traditionally served as an opportunity for the GOP to showcase its candidates up and down the ballot and unify behind their presidential nominee after sometimes divisive primaries.</p>
<p>They’re also the point every four years, with at least one exception, when party leaders release their key policy goals for the next four years.</p>
<p>The RNC released its trimmed-down party platform the week prior to the convention, after foregoing one entirely in 2020. And while many Republicans in Congress said during interviews they either support it, or hadn’t read it, some were critical it adopts Trump’s position that abortion access be left up to states — one of the top issues in the presidential race.</p>
<p>The platform wraps in longtime party goals as well as others tied to Trump. But it also competes with attention drawn to the Heritage Foundation’s massive far-right Project 2025 policy agenda, which Trump has repeatedly disavowed.</p>
<p>Democrats and President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign have targeted the document spearheaded by former Trump administration officials — which says the president should work with Congress on abortion policy — as an example of an extreme GOP agenda.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation is scheduled to host an all-day “policy fest” on Monday at the RNC Convention, headlined by conservative media personality Tucker Carlson and former Utah Congressman Jason Chaffetz, among others.</p>
<p>The RNC convention could also be the showcase for Trump announcing his running mate, after months of speculation about who would get the nod. As of Friday, Trump had not revealed his pick, though <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/calm-conservative-confident-what-gop-senators-want-trumps-vice-presidential-pick" target="_blank">speculation centered </a>around Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.</p>
<p>There was also little information available ahead of the convention as to the lineup and schedule of speakers in official sessions throughout the week, which culminates with the nomination of Trump on Thursday and his speech.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unhappiness over abortion stance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>GOP members of Congress said in interviews that took place days before the shooting they would have liked to have seen a national abortion ban in the platform.</p>
<p>Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the top Republican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said he preferred the GOP’s last official platform, which called for a nationwide abortion ban after 20 weeks.</p>
<p>“I’m pro-life and I like the way it was previously,” Cassidy said.</p>
<p>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said while she hadn’t read the full platform, she had read the section about abortion, as well as a few others.</p>
<p>“I am pro-life and I am always going to be adamantly pro-life,” Ernst said. “And I think what we’re going to have to do is work very hard to educate the American people on the value of life. So would I like to see more robust (language) in the platform? Certainly. But that’s not the way it’s going to be. So we’re just going to have to continue fighting for life.”</p>
<p>Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said the platform places a “new emphasis on the states” to regulate abortion access, largely as a result of Trump pressing for that structure in an attempt to appeal to independent voters, though Lankford said it won’t bind Republicans in Congress.</p>
<p>“Obviously, this is a platform that’s wrapped around him, it’s a new model for presidential platforms to be wrapped around the candidate,” Lankford said.</p>
<p>Trump has shifted the GOP platform away from pressing for a nationwide law, in part, because he doesn’t believe the votes are there at the moment, Lankford said. But that doesn’t mean Republican lawmakers will stop talking about their beliefs or working to build support for a nationwide law.</p>
<p>“It’s a common ground statement,” Lankford said of the platform. “But for those of us that believe in the value of every single child — and we should do whatever we can to be able to protect the lives of children — we will continue to be able to speak out on those things.”</p>
<p>Mike Pence, former Indiana governor and vice president during Trump’s first term in office, released a <a href="https://advancingamericanfreedom.com/vice-president-pence-on-rnc-platform-a-profound-disappointment-to-pro-life-republicans/" target="_blank">statement</a> saying the “RNC platform is a profound disappointment to the millions of pro-life Republicans that have always looked to the Republican Party to stand for life.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, this platform is part of a broader retreat in our party, trying to remain vague for political expedience,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Pence called on delegates attending the RNC convention to “restore language to our party’s platform recognizing the sanctity of human life and affirming that the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shorter, vaguer</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://cdn.nucleusfiles.com/be/beb1a388-1d88-4389-a67d-c1e2d7f8bedf/2024-gop-platform-july-7-final.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ncl_amplify&amp;utm_campaign=240708-2024_gop_platform_make_america_great_again&amp;utm_content=ncl-4NsN8UE5x2&amp;_nlid=4NsN8UE5x2&amp;_nhids=Yy5JhERzJ" target="_blank">16-page platform</a> is much shorter than years past and is at times vague about the goals the Republican Party hopes to accomplish if voters give them unified control of the federal government during the next two years.</p>
<p>The official document was put together behind closed doors.</p>
<p>It says that after nearly 50 years, “because of us,” the ability to regulate abortion has “been given to the States and to a vote of the People.”</p>
<p>“We will oppose Late Term Abortion, while supporting mothers and policies that advance Prenatal Care, access to Birth Control, and IVF (fertility treatments),” the new RNC platform states.</p>
<p>The 2016 Republican Party <a href="https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf" target="_blank">platform</a>, by contrast, was 66 pages long and mentioned abortion more than 30 times, calling for Congress to pass legislation that banned abortion after 20-weeks gestation.</p>
<p>That previous platform also said that the RNC respected “the states’ authority and flexibility to exclude abortion providers from federal programs such as Medicaid and other healthcare and family planning programs so long as they continue to perform or refer for elective abortions or sell the body parts of aborted children.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Nothing going to happen up here in the Senate’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said that it’s extremely unlikely either political party gets the 60 votes needed to advance abortion legislation through the legislative filibuster in the Senate, making the states the more practical place to enact laws.</p>
<p>“There’s not 48 votes on this issue one way or the other up here, let alone 60,” Marshall said. “There’s nothing going to happen up here in the Senate in the near future, if forever.”</p>
<p>Marshall said that Republicans “won” in getting the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and that the issue is now left up to voters.</p>
<p>Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley said a full GOP platform shorter than in previous years is a good development, since people might actually read it.</p>
<p>“Nobody’s gonna read the Sears catalog, like previous ones,” Grassley said. “And I think if we can get people to read the Republican platform, it’ll be a great thing for the campaign. I think it’d be a great thing for government generally.”</p>
<p>Grassley said he couldn’t make a judgment about the new abortion language, since he didn’t remember the language from the 2016 platform.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voters expect all of GOP on same page</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Alabama Sen. Katie Britt said she hadn’t read through the platform, but that she was encouraged some anti-abortion groups expressed support for the new language.</p>
<p>“I’m proud to be pro-life and proud to support the party and President Trump,” Britt said.</p>
<p>Voters, she said, expect to hear from a unified Republican Party during convention week as well as from one that focuses on policy.</p>
<p>“I think people want a secure border, they want stable prices, they want a more secure world,” Britt said. “And I think we need to talk about those things — talk about not only where we are, but our vision for moving forward.”</p>
<p>Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, didn’t directly answer a question about whether he supports removing a nationwide abortion ban from the party’s platform.</p>
<p>“Look, I think they did good work on the platform,” Daines said. “We’re a party that believes in life, we’re a pro-life party. I think they did a good job.”</p>
<p>West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said that voters want to hear Republicans unified at the convention.</p>
<p>“I think they want to hear a unifying message for the future,” Capito said. “I think they want to hear how things will be different and better, especially on the economy and border and international. And I just think, you know, a united front is probably the most important.”</p>
<p>Arkansas Sen. John Boozman said the GOP should emphasize how it differs from Democrats during the RNC Convention.</p>
<p>“I think that they need to hear a message of unity and the contrast between what Republicans can accomplish on inflation and border,” Boozman said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">National treasures, women’s sports</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The RNC’s<a href="https://cdn.nucleusfiles.com/be/beb1a388-1d88-4389-a67d-c1e2d7f8bedf/2024-gop-platform-july-7-final.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ncl_amplify&amp;utm_campaign=240708-2024_gop_platform_make_america_great_again&amp;utm_content=ncl-4NsN8UE5x2&amp;_nlid=4NsN8UE5x2&amp;_nhids=Yy5JhERzJ" target="_blank"> new platform</a> includes familiar GOP policy goals as well as some that came along after Trump became the party’s nominee eight years ago.</p>
<p>For example, it calls for Republicans to “promote beauty in Public Architecture and preserve our Natural Treasures. We will build cherished symbols of our Nation, and restore genuine Conservation efforts.”</p>
<p>It also calls on GOP lawmakers to “support the restoration of Classic Liberal Arts Education,” though it doesn’t detail that particular issue.</p>
<p>The rest of the platform is pretty standard for the types of initiatives and policy goals that Republicans have traditionally pursued.</p>
<p>For example, it calls on Republicans to slash “wasteful Government spending,” “restore every Border Policy of the Trump administration,” make provisions from the 2017 tax law permanent and “will keep men out of women’s sports.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump running mate</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The RNC convention could also include Trump announcing who will campaign with him at the top of the ticket.</p>
<p>His last running mate, Pence, began distancing himself from Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, which included calls from the mob to kill Pence, and the construction of a scaffold for public hangings on the National Mall.</p>
<p>Pence was in the Capitol building that day and was removed from danger by his security detail as the pro-Trump mob beat police officers, broke into the building and disrupted Congress’ certification of Biden as the country’s next president.</p>
<p>Trump, without revealing his vice presidential selection, wrote Thursday on social media that he is “looking very much forward to being in Milwaukee next week.”</p>
<p>“The great people of Wisconsin will reward us for choosing their State for the Republican National Convention. From there we go on to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! See you next week,” he posted on Truth Social, his online platform where he regularly publishes comments and statements.</p>
<p>The vice presidential candidate typically gives a speech on Wednesday night, so Trump is expected to make his announcement before then.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Project 2025</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Conservative operatives striving to elect Trump to the White House have been circulating the 922-page Project 2025 <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank">plan</a> for nearly 15 months.</p>
<p>Spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, in conjunction with more than 100 organizations, the policy agenda titled “Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise” presents a roadmap should Trump win in November.</p>
<p>The “goal is to assemble an army of aligned, vetted, trained, and prepared conservatives to go to work on Day One to deconstruct the Administrative State,” according to the organization’s description of the mandate.</p>
<p>The lengthy mandate sets forth core promises to “restore the family” and overhaul government agencies.</p>
<p>The document states that “(i)n particular, the next conservative President should work with Congress to enact the most robust protections for the unborn that Congress will support while deploying existing federal powers to protect innocent life and vigorously complying with statutory bans on the federal funding of abortion.”</p>
<p>The mandate is just one pillar under the multi-pronged “Project 2025: Presidential Transition Project” that also includes a presidential administration training academy and a 180-day “playbook” aimed “to bring quick relief to Americans suffering from the Left’s devastating policies.” The project is <a href="https://www.project2025.org/about/about-project-2025/" target="_blank">led</a> by two former Trump administration officials.</p>
<p>The Biden-Harris campaign and Democrats have repeatedly criticized Project 2025 in comments and campaign emails.</p>
<p>“If implemented, Project 2025 would be the latest attempt in Donald Trump’s full on assault on reproductive freedom,” Vice President Kamala Harris said at a rally in North Carolina on Thursday.</p>
<p>Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during a press conference Thursday that the plan is “dangerous, it’s dastardly and it’s diabolical.”</p>
<p>“Project 2025, the Trump and extreme MAGA Republican agenda, will criminalize abortion care and impose a nationwide ban on reproductive freedom,” Jeffries said.</p>
<p>Trump and his campaign deny any connection to the project.</p>
<p>“I know nothing about Project 2025. I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it, and, unlike our very well received Republican Platform, had nothing to do with it,” Trump wrote Thursday on his social media platform Truth Social.</p>
<p>“The Radical Left Democrats are having a field day, however, trying to hook me into whatever policies are stated or said. It is pure disinformation on their part,” he continued. “By now, after all of these years, everyone knows where I stand on EVERYTHING!”</p>
<p>Trump has delivered keynote speeches at Heritage Foundation events <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?435817-1/president-trump-remarks-heritage-foundation" target="_blank">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/story/news/trump/2022/04/21/donald-trump-visiting-amelia-island-heritage-foundation-meeting/7397314001/" target="_blank">times</a>. An <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html" target="_blank">analysis</a> by CNN showed 140 former Trump administration staffers were involved in the project. Kevin Roberts, Heritage Foundation president, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/us/politics/republican-president-2024-heritage-foundation.html" target="_blank">told</a> the New York Times in April 2023 that Trump had been briefed on the project.</p>

<p>Biden declined to say if the incident, which is under investigation by the Secret Service, was an assassination attempt.</p>
<p>“I have an opinion, but I don’t have any facts,” Biden said, speaking from the Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, police department, near his vacation home there. “So I want to make sure we have all the facts before I make some comment.”</p>
<p>Biden said he hadn’t spoken to Trump yet, but that he hoped to talk with him by phone soon.</p>
<p>“I have tried to get a hold of Donald. He’s with his doctors. Apparently he’s doing well,” Biden said. “I plan on talking to him shortly. I hope when I get back to the telephone.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump on social media</h4>

	
<p>Trump posted on social media after Biden’s remarks concluded that he wanted to offer “condolences to the family of the person at the Rally who was killed, and also to the family of another person that was badly injured.”</p>
<p>“It is incredible that such an act can take place in our Country,” Trump wrote. “Nothing is known at this time about the shooter, who is now dead.”</p>
<p>Trump added that he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.”</p>
<p>“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin,” Trump wrote. “Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘We cannot condone this’</h4>

	
<p>Biden said during his public comments the type of violence that took place <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">during the rally</a> was unacceptable and should never happen.</p>
<p>“There is no place in America for this kind of violence. It’s sick,” Biden said. “It’s one of the reasons why we have to unite this country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.”</p>
<p>Trump, he said, should have been able to have the rally without any violence.</p>
<p>“The idea that there’s political violence or violence in America like this is just unheard of, it’s just not appropriate,” Biden said. “Everybody must condemn it.”</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris also issued a statement saying she had been briefed on the incident.</p>
<p>“Doug and I are relieved that he is not seriously injured. We are praying for him, his family, and all those who have been injured and impacted by this senseless shooting,” she said of Trump.</p>
<p>“Violence such as this has no place in our nation,” Harris wrote. “We must all condemn this abhorrent act and do our part to ensure that it does not lead to more violence.”</p>

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Members of Congress rejected political violence Saturday after a shooting at Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Pennsylvania left at least one rallygoer dead and forced the Secret Service to rush the former president off stage.</p>
<p>Local authorities confirmed the shooter was killed, according to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/campaigns-elections/trump-campaigns-in-western-pennsylvania-with-rally-in-butler-county/" target="_blank">shooting at a crowded outdoor rally</a> in Butler, just an hour outside Pittsburgh, occurred less than 48 hours before the Republican National Convention is set to begin in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Trump is expected to become the party’s official presidential nominee on Thursday.</p>
<p>Video <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1812252484804751635" target="_blank">footage of the rally</a> shows Trump bringing his hand to the right side of his face and ducking down behind the podium just after several gunshots and screams were heard. U.S. Secret Service agents huddled around the former president and raced him off the stage as he reached out to pump his fist in the air toward the crowd.</p>
<p>Trump campaign spokesman Steve Cheung issued a statement shortly after that the former president is “fine” and that he thanked law enforcement.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Praying for President Trump’</h4>

	
<p>Members of Congress from both political parties uniformly condemned violence in a wave of social media posts and official statements.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, posted on social media that he was “Praying for President Trump.”</p>
<p>“Kelly and I are praying for President Trump and all the attendees of the campaign rally today in Pennsylvania, and we send our gratitude to the law enforcement who responded at the scene,” Johnson wrote.</p>
<p>“I have been briefed by law enforcement and am continuing to monitor the developments,” Johnson added. “This horrific act of political violence at a peaceful campaign rally has no place in this country and should be unanimously and forcefully condemned.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, released a written statement saying that he was “horrified by what happened at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania and relieved that former President Trump is safe.”</p>
<p>“Political violence has no place in our country,” Schumer wrote.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, wrote on social media that “all Americans are grateful that President Trump appears to be fine after a despicable attack on a peaceful rally.”</p>
<p>“Violence has no place in our politics,” McConnell wrote. “We appreciate the swift work of the Secret Service and other law enforcement.”</p>
<p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, wrote on social media that his “thoughts and prayers are with former President Trump.”</p>
<p>“I am thankful for the decisive law enforcement response,” Jeffries wrote. “America is a democracy. Political violence of any kind is never acceptable.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Members of Congress react with horror</h4>

	
<p>Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania issued a statement that he was monitoring the situation that unfolded in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“(A)nd I’ve reached out (to) the State Police to offer support. Political violence is never acceptable and I am hoping former president Trump &amp; all attendees are safe. Everyone in Butler should listen to law enforcement,” Casey wrote on social media.</p>
<p>Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, whose wife Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman, was shot in 2011 at an event, posted that they were both “horrified.”</p>
<p>“Gabby and I are horrified by the incident in Pennsylvania,” Kelly wrote. “No one should ever have to experience political violence — we know that firsthand. We’re keeping former President Trump, his family, and everyone involved in our thoughts.”</p>
<p>Giffords wrote on her own social media feed that “Political violence is terrifying. I know.”</p>
<p>“I’m holding former President Trump, and all those affected by today’s indefensible act of violence in my heart. Political violence is un-American and is never acceptable — never,” Giffords wrote.</p>
<p>Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, wrote on social media that “(p)olitical violence is despicable, and there is no place for it in America.”</p>
<p>“I’m grateful that former President Trump is safe, and to the law enforcement officials who risked their lives to take action” Peters wrote. “I will continue to closely monitor this developing situation.”</p>
<p>Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins wrote on social media that she was “very relieved that President Trump appears to be OK; however, this violence is absolutely appalling.”</p>
<p>“Thank God for the Secret Service and first responders who hurried President Trump out of harm’s way,” Collins wrote.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Quick response</h4>

	
<p>Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, commended the quick response of Secret Service agents and other authorities on the scene.</p>
<p>“My thoughts and prayers are with former President Donald Trump and his family after hearing news of a shooting at his campaign rally today,” DeLauro of Connecticut posted on social media.</p>
<p>House Republican Mike Turner of Ohio, chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a statement saying “As the situation unfolds in Butler, Pennsylvania, I urge everyone to join me in praying for President Trump and our country.”</p>
<p>House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York wrote on social media that “AMERICA IS PRAYING! GOD BLESS PRESIDENT TRUMP!<a href="https://x.com/hashtag/SAVEAMERICA?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank"> #SAVEAMERICA</a>,”</p>
<p>“I’m praying for President Trump. I hope everyone will join me,” former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy wrote on X.</p>
<p>“Jacquie and I are praying for President Trump and all of the attendees at today’s rally. President Trump is a proven warrior who has overcome adversity time and time again. He will rise above this horrifying situation stronger than ever,” House Republican Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota posted.</p>
<p>Former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, an outspoken critic of Trump and ranking member of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, said news of the shooting was “horrifying.”</p>
<p>“Violence of any kind has no place in American politics. We are grateful for the reaction of Secret Service and other law enforcement and pray for the former president and all those injured,” Cheney wrote on social media.</p>
<p>Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement on social media saying he was “shocked by the apparent attack on President Trump.”</p>
<p>“We pray for his safety and speedy recovery,” the leader of the U.S. ally said.</p>

Jon Tester (D-MT) departs the Capitol on July 8, 2024 in Washington, DC. Several Democratic members of Congress have urged President Joe Biden to withdraw from the presidential race after his June 27 debate against presumed Republican nominee Donald Trump. Concerns about Biden's age and perceived slowing down have intensified, with critics fearing these issues could undermine his ability to effectively challenge Trump in the upcoming election. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Democrats in Congress called on President Joe Biden to prove to voters that he is up for another four years in the Oval Office, though many in interviews pledged to stick with him as the presumptive nominee as they returned to the Capitol on Monday following the Fourth of July recess.</p>
<p>Questions over Biden’s ability to continue with his reelection campaign dominated the nation’s capital throughout the day. Biden shipped a defiant letter to Hill Democrats and unexpectedly called in to a popular morning MSNBC show to make his case. At the White House, reporters engaged in a tense back-and-forth with Biden press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre over the president’s mental fitness.</p>
<p>Most significantly, the comments about Biden’s future from more than 20 lawmakers came just ahead of crucial meetings Tuesday, when Senate and House Democrats will huddle separately to work out the path ahead for Biden’s reelection bid.</p>
<p>The decision about whether to back Biden is especially tough for vulnerable senators, who are seeking to hold the chamber against long odds, and House members from swing districts full of Republican voters.</p>
<p>Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, a close confidant to Biden, defended the president when asked by States Newsroom whether Biden can steer the narrative back to policy issues and away from questions about his cognitive function, following his shaky debate performance on June 27.</p>
<p>“I’m really struck no one’s asked me a question about should Donald Trump drop out, should Donald Trump have a neurological exam, should Donald Trump be facing Republicans calling for him to step aside given his demonstrably immoral, unhinged conduct? He’s a convict,” Coons said, referring to the former president and presumptive GOP nominee. “In my view, Joe Biden has won our primaries, has won our confidence and deserves our support.”</p>
<p>Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet said Democrats must be level-headed about whether to encourage Biden to withdraw as their presumptive nominee, arguing that it is now more of a moral question than a political one.</p>
<p>“I think it is really important for us, as Democrats, to have an open discussion and to have an open debate to ensure that we are on a path to winning the White House, to winning the Senate, to winning the House,” Bennet said. “And I think that’s an act, not of disloyalty, but an act of loyalty.”</p>
<p>This year’s election is especially critical for Democrats in swing districts and purple states, and party leaders need to ensure the top of the ticket can help those people, not hinder them, said Bennet, who is not up for reelection.</p>
<p>Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico said she wants House Democrats to unify at Tuesday morning’s party meeting.</p>
<p>“My hope is that Democrats come to a reasonable consensus about the path forward, which is that we have to defeat Donald Trump,” Stansbury said.</p>
<p>“And right now we’ve got to work like hell to make sure that people understand the consequences of reelecting Donald Trump. He is a convicted felon, he is a perpetrator in the January 6th (attack), he is all the things that we know he is. And so while I understand the media focus on the current moment, we really need to shift back to the real danger,” Stansbury said.</p>
<p>The unease among congressional Democrats came after a handful of senior House Democrats on Sunday said Biden should step down on a private phone call with Democratic leaders, according to media reports. Rep. Adam Smith of Washington publicly called on Biden to exit the race Monday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Biden defenders</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said his confidence in Biden is “high,” but he understands “the reality of the challenges that he faces and we face since the debate.”</p>
<p>“It’s raised a national discussion about his competence and the ability to finish the campaign,” Durbin said.</p>
<p>The Illinois lawmaker said he has been discussing alternatives to Biden with colleagues, but so far hasn’t heard a name he’s willing to endorse publicly.</p>
<p>Durbin said he does worry that if Biden remains the nominee, the focus will stay on his health and not on the issues that Democrats want to be front and center in the campaign.</p>

<p>Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine said he told voters in his home state over the Fourth of July week that he respects Biden and “never had reason to question his ability to be a patriot, put the country first. And I’m sure he’ll make a decision that does that.”</p>
<p>“And that decision is going to be one that I support,” he said.</p>
<p>Kaine said that Biden often does better talking to smaller groups of voters and suggested his campaign get him in that setting more often, if they want to alleviate concerns.</p>
<p>“Okay, he had a bad debate performance. But when he interacts with everyday folks who are going through challenges, talking about their aspirations and how to achieve them, that’s his strong suit,” Kaine said. “And I’ve seen him do that again and again and again. And I hope the campaign will find ways for him to do that because he does it better than anybody.”</p>
<p>California Rep. Ami Bera said Biden has a pretty good chance to outrun his debate performance, especially considering all the bad headlines that came out during the 2016 Trump campaign.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump came back from ‘Access Hollywood,’ right?” Bera said. “So there’s a long time in this campaign cycle. It was always going to be a close race, but it’s going to be hard if we’re not on the same page.”</p>
<p>Bera called on Biden to meet with Democrats in Congress and for the party to be honest about polling and fundraising.</p>
<p>“I think that the debate was not a good debate. It was one that gave a lot of folks pause,” Bera said. “But the president has said he’s committed to running. At this juncture, having a divided house doesn’t make sense. That’s why my advice is, he ought to come to the Democrats or ought to invite us to meet with him somewhere else. And we all ought to get on the same page.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Congressional Black Caucus chair supportive of Biden</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Nevada Democratic Rep. Steven Horsford, who also chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said he decided to support Biden’s ongoing candidacy after talking with voters in his district.</p>
<p>“I’m a frontline member in a battleground state. I have as tough of a district as anyone here in the House and I’ve been a frontliner for the last three cycles,” Horsford said. “What my constituents have said is they voted for President Joe Biden, and they expect their representative to honor their vote and the will of the people. And there’s a process and that process should not be overturned by a few select members in Congress.”</p>
<p>Sen. Alex Padilla of California said he remains steadfast in his support for Biden.</p>
<p>“I would encourage my colleagues to take all the time and energy that we’re spending on this topic and put it into voter outreach and organizing for November,” he said.</p>
<p>New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Luján said he continues to back Biden and is confident that he will win reelection in November.</p>
<p>“What I want to see is President Biden out and about, like we saw this weekend, talking to more people at rallies and areas and just being himself,” Luján said. “I think that he’s the best when he’s just himself and chatting with people.”</p>
<p>Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chair Nanette Barragán said she supports Biden and isn’t focused on what the risk could be if voters don’t gain more confidence in his health.</p>
<p>“I think he can win. He has won. He has ideas. He’s got plans,” Barragán said. “When I talk to people, even people who’ve been undecided have said ‘The president has ideas and he has a track record. The other person is just going up there and telling lies.’”</p>
<p>Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said that she continues to back Biden because of his record while in the White House.</p>
<p>“He’s been there every step of the way supporting Nevadans as we came through the pandemic, as we fight for a woman’s right to choose, as we lower costs for families, and fighting for affordable housing,” Cortez Masto said. “He’s been on the picket lines with so many in my state. So at the end of the day, I know he’s good for Nevada, and so I stand with him.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More defenders</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden said Democrats have “a lot of work to do” to get Biden reelected in November, but said “that’s always the case.”</p>
<p>And while the debate was a “rough night,” he said, there will be many more of those if Trump is reelected president in November.</p>
<p>“You want a lot of rough nights? You’re gonna get four years of them if you elect Donald Trump,” Wyden said.</p>
<p>Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, who is also chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said he will continue to back Biden.</p>
<p>“I support Joe Biden. He is our nominee,” Peters said. “I’m confident he will win and we’re going to be able to hold the Senate as well.”</p>
<p>New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman said Democrats need to unify “to protect this democracy” and brushed aside a question about whether Biden is being honest with himself about his health.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that he’s ever done anything that suggests to me that he’s a liar, like his opponent,” Watson Coleman said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Conversations are healthy’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said she has confidence in Biden to do the right thing, but didn’t say what exactly she believes that is.</p>
<p>“I think the conversations are healthy,” Shaheen said. “I expect him to do what’s in the best interest of the country.”</p>
<p>Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said, “the most important thing right now is to beat Donald Trump. Talking to you all is not gonna necessarily help that.”</p>
<p>Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection in Wisconsin, would not answer reporters directly when asked if she supports Biden.</p>
<p>“I support the Democratic ticket,” she said.</p>
<p>Rep. Jared Huffman of California said the Democratic Caucus meeting Tuesday, which will be private, will be “important” and that he wasn’t ready to comment further on Biden’s reelection bid.</p>
<p>“I support continuing this conversation and winning the election,” Huffman said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Not answering questions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse refused to answer repeated questions from reporters on Capitol Hill, saying he wanted to wait to hear what his colleagues say during the Tuesday closed-door lunch.</p>
<p>Several senators, including Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, quickly bypassed reporters or pointed them to written statements they’ve issued.</p>
<p>Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland declined to comment “because we’re still in the middle of the whole thing.”</p>
<p>“We’re all working for the best solution,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senators with tough races</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Vulnerable U.S. senators, who have so far been quiet, issued statements Monday addressing Biden’s ability to remain in the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said in a written statement Biden “has got to prove to the American people—including me—that he’s up to the job for another four years,” according to media <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/4760277-tester-says-biden-must-prove-hes-up-to-the-job/" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, I’ll continue to do what I’ve always done: Stand up to President Biden when he’s wrong and protect our Montana way of life,” Tester said in his statement.</p>
<p>Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio said on the campaign trail Monday that he’s heard concerns from voters regarding Biden moving forward in the race, according to an NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/trump-biden-election-2024-live-updates-rcna160227" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
<p>“I’m not a pundit. I’ve talked to people across Ohio. They have legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign, and I’ll keep listening to people,” Brown said.</p>
<p>Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the president pro tempore and chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, issued a written statement highly critical of Biden remaining the nominee.</p>
<p>“I have a deep appreciation and strong respect for Joe, who has led a historic first term as President,” Murray wrote.</p>
<p>“Still, we need to see a much more forceful and energetic candidate on the campaign trail in the very near future in order for him to convince voters he is up to the job,” she said. “At this critical time for our country, President Biden must seriously consider the best way to preserve his incredible legacy and secure it for the future.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parkinson’s disease specialist</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Administration officials defended Biden on Monday during a 75-minute, and at times tense, press briefing where reporters largely questioned Biden’s capacity to continue his reelection bid.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre told reporters the president has cleared detailed neurological exams during each of his three annual physicals, the last one being in February.</p>
<p>The exams “have been detailed, they have been extensive,” she said, refusing to confirm names of medical specialists, for security reasons in a lengthy back-and-forth with reporters.</p>
<p>Journalists pressed Jean-Pierre about a Monday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/08/us/politics/parkinsons-expert-white-house.html" target="_blank">report</a> in the New York Times that a Parkinson’s disease specialist from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center visited the White House eight times from July 2023 to March. Parkinson’s is a “progressive disorder that affects the nervous system and the parts of the body controlled by the nerves,” <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20376055" target="_blank">according to</a> the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre said “thousands” of military personnel come to the White House.</p>
<p>“Has the president been treated for Parkinson’s? No. Is he being treated for Parkinson’s? No, he’s not. Is he taking medication for Parkinson’s? No. So those are the things I can give you full-blown answers on, but I’m not going to confirm a specialist, or any specialist, that comes to the White House,” Jean-Pierre said.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre repeatedly stated that Biden receives regular “verbal check-ins” with his doctor, usually while he is exercising.</p>
<p>The White House released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Letter7.8.24.pdf" target="_blank">two-page memo </a>much later Monday that Dr. Kevin Cannard “was the neurological specialist that examined President Biden for each of his annual physicals.”</p>
<p>“His findings have been made public each time that I have released the results of the President’s annual physical,” wrote Dr. Kevin O’Connor, physician to the president. “President Biden has not seen a neurologist outside of his annual physical.”</p>
<p>Cannard has been the Neurology Consultant to the White House Medical Unit for 12 years and has held regular clinics for “active-duty members” at the White House, according to the letter.</p>
<p>The president is scheduled to spend most of the week with NATO leaders at the summit in Washington, D.C., and will give a solo press conference Thursday evening.</p>
<p>National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said during the press briefing “we’re not picking up any signs of (concerns) from our allies at all.”</p>
<p>Kirby dismissed questions that Biden’s debate performance could be illustrative of his communications with his international counterparts.</p>
<p>“What I saw in that debate is not reflective of the man and the leader and the commander-in-chief that I have spent many, many hours with over the last two-and-a-half years, in terms of the specificity of the way he probes, the questions he asks,” Kirby said. “Heck, just this morning he was asking me questions about a situation on the European continent that I couldn’t answer, and I told him I’d have to get back to him.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden pushes back with letter, calls in to ‘Morning Joe’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24794331-bidenletterjuly8" target="_blank">letter</a> to congressional Democrats, Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-tells-congressional-dems-he-staying-race-urges-end-speculation" target="_blank">wrote</a> Monday that he is “firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>He then called into MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” for a live phone <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe" target="_blank">interview</a> during which he criticized Democrats urging him to exit the race as “elites.”</p>
<p>“I’m getting so frustrated by the elites — now I’m not talking about you guys — the elites in the party, ‘Oh, they know so much more.’ Any of these guys that don’t think I should run, run against me. Announce for president, challenge me at the convention,” he said to hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.</p>
<p>When asked by Brzezinski whether he can assure Americans that he won’t have another performance like the June 27 debate, Biden responded, “Look at my career, I’ve not had many of those nights.”</p>
<p>The live interview came one day after Biden held a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where he was joined by U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, Rep. Madeleine Dean and Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. Austin Davis.</p>
<p>Biden began the weekend with a 22-minute <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-first-tv-interview-debate-denies-medical-condition-it-was-bad-episode" target="_blank">interview</a> Friday night with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos during which he attributed his debate performance to a “bad episode.”</p>
<p>The first sign of waning Democratic support appeared July 2 when Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas became the first sitting congressional Democrat <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/texas-us-house-member-calls-biden-withdraw-amid-debate-fallout" target="_blank">to call on Biden to withdraw</a> from the 2024 race.</p>

(Photo used with permission of ABC News)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Friday in his first televised interview since the presidential debate defended his reelection bid and rejected calls that he should step aside amid growing anxiety among some Democrats about his mental and physical state.</p>
<p>The 22-minute<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/abc-news-anchor-george-stephanopoulos-exclusive-interview-biden/story?id=111695695" target="_blank"> interview </a>with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos came as some lawmakers and other prominent Democrats have said Biden should suspend his campaign and let someone else become the official nominee. Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner is &#8220;attempting to assemble a group of Democratic senators to ask President Biden to exit the presidential race,&#8221; <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/mark-warner-joe-biden-exit-race-democratic-senators/" target="_blank">according</a> to the Washington Post.</p>
<p>But Biden said that’s unnecessary, distilling his actions during the June 27 debate as simply a “bad night.”</p>
<p>“It was a bad episode, no indication of any serious condition,” Biden said. “I was exhausted. I didn’t listen to my instincts in terms of preparing and it was a bad night.”</p>
<p>Biden refused to answer a question about what he would do if allies and friends in Congress urged him to leave the presidential campaign.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to answer that question. It’s not going to happen,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Members of Congress and Democratic governors <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/democrats-reel-terrible-biden-debate-performance-he-defends-candidacy%C2%A0" target="_blank">have expressed concern</a> with Biden remaining the presumptive nominee ever since he struggled to answer questions and had moments where he appeared confused during the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-and-trump-trade-insults-accusations-lying-acrimonious-presidential-debate" target="_blank">first presidential debate</a>.</p>
<p>Biden brushed aside Virginia Sen. Mark Warner’s plans to convene Democratic senators on Monday to discuss the future of Biden’s bid, which multiple news organizations <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/05/mark-warner-joe-biden-exit-race-democratic-senators/" target="_blank">reported</a> Friday. Both chambers of Congress will return to Washington next week.</p>
<p>“Mark is a good man,” Biden said, before incorrectly claiming Warner “tried to get the nomination” for president — Warner in 2006 <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna15234727" target="_blank">said</a> he would not make a bid. “Mark and I have a different perspective. I respect him.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden won’t commit to cognitive exam</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Stephanopoulos pressed Biden during the interview on whether he really has the mental and physical stamina to remain president for another four years, and whether Biden is being honest with himself about his age.</p>
<p>“I believe so,” Biden said. “I wouldn’t be running if I didn’t think I did. Look, I’m running again because I think I understand best what has to be done to take this nation to a completely new level.”</p>
<p>Biden repeatedly declined to commit to taking a cognitive exam, suggesting that his schedule and daily work load are evidence enough he’s up to the task of being president.</p>
<p>“I have a cognitive test every single day. Every day I have that test, everything I do,” Biden said. “You know, not only am I campaigning, I’m running the world.”</p>
<p>Biden added that there are 125 days left in the campaign and that people should watch him in the months ahead to determine if he’s suitable to be reelected to the highest position in the government.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">In Wisconsin, Biden points to Trump flubs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The ABC News interview aired just hours after Biden <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/07/05/defiant-biden-tells-wisconsinites-im-staying-in-the-race/" target="_blank">held a rally</a> in Madison, Wisconsin, where he repeatedly criticized the Republican presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump.</p>
<p>This November’s presidential election, Biden said, should be about character, honesty and decency.</p>
<p>“Let’s focus on what really matters: We’re running against the biggest liar and the biggest threat to our democracy in American history,” Biden said. “That’s not hyperbole.”</p>
<p>Biden sought to shift the attention from his performance at the debate to flubs Trump has made over the years, including in a Fourth of July speech in 2019 when the former president said securing the airports was essential during the Revolutionary War.</p>
<p>“He said George Washington’s army won the Revolution by taking control of the airports from the British,” Biden said before crossing himself somewhat jokingly. “Talk about me misspeaking — airports from the British in 1776? It’s true, he is a stable genius.”</p>
<p>Trump, at the time, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-blames-teleprompter-revolutionary-war-airports-flub-n1026931" target="_blank">criticized the teleprompter</a> for the comment.</p>
<p>Biden during the rally listed off what he views as his accomplishments, including canceling some student loan debt, nominating Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, signing a same-sex marriage bill, approving gun safety policies and working with Congress on a sweeping climate change law.</p>
<p>“I’m not letting one, 90-minute debate wipe out three-and-a-half years of work,” Biden said.</p>
<p>During the next four years, Biden said, whoever holds the Oval Office will appoint at least two new justices to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Should that be Trump, a recent <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/presidential-immunity-extends-some-official-acts-supreme-court-rules-trump-case" target="_blank">ruling from the justices </a>on presidential immunity could lead to a challenging time for the country, Biden said.</p>
<p>“For over two centuries, America’s been a free, democratic nation,” Biden said. “And I’ll be damned if in the year 2024 — just two years before our 250th anniversary as a nation — I’ll let Donald Trump take this away.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Illinois Dem congressman says Biden should quit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden briefly spoke with reporters in the White House pool after the rally, saying he was determined to stay in the race and brushing aside calls from some lawmakers for him to withdraw.</p>
<p>When asked by a reporter about Warner suggesting Biden let another person take over as the party’s presidential candidate, Biden said Warner “is the only one considering that.”</p>
<p>Later in the evening, Illinois Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley said on MSNBC that Biden should step aside.</p>
<p>“Mr. President, your legacy is set. We owe you the greatest debt of gratitude,” Quigley <a href="https://x.com/allinwithchris/status/1809367054845386771" target="_blank">said</a>. “The only thing that you can do now to cement that for all time and prevent utter catastrophe is to step down and let someone else do this.”</p>

Biden and Trump are facing off in the first presidential debate of the 2024 campaign. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p><p>President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump pitched to undecided voters Thursday night during the first debate of the presidential campaign — trading insults over their policy differences, immigration and who represents a threat to democracy.</p>
<p>During the debate from CNN’s headquarters in Atlanta, the two men argued over who can do better for Americans during the next four years on a broad swath of issues, ranging from the economy to climate change to foreign policy. Each repeatedly accused the other of lying.</p>
<p>Biden early in the debate spoke softly at several points, coughed and gave several somewhat confusing answers. At one point, Biden appeared to lose his train of thought and ended an answer with the statement that “we finally beat Medicare.”</p>
<p>The two disagreed sharply over access to reproductive rights, including abortion, with Trump arguing Democrats’ position is “radical” and Biden saying that leaving decisions up to the states has been “terrible” for women.</p>
<p>Biden, 81, and Trump, 78, did not shake hands at the beginning, a break from past debates.</p>
<p>Near the end of the debate, Trump said political violence was “totally unacceptable,” though he went on to downplay the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, defending the conduct of his mob of supporters.</p>
<p>Trump initially did not directly answer a question about whether he would accept the results of the election if he lost. When pressed by moderator Dana Bash, Trump conditioned his answer.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jabs over personal conduct</h4>

	
<p>Even with rules meant to minimize crosstalk, the debate — moderated by Bash, anchor and chief political correspondent, and Jake Tapper, anchor and chief Washington correspondent — saw many moments of acrimony.</p>
<p>While Trump had harsh words about Biden’s border policy and Biden blasted his predecessor for appointing Supreme Court justices who overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, they saved their harshest criticism for the other’s personal conduct.</p>
<p>Referring to reports that, as president, Trump said veterans killed in action in France during World War II were “suckers and losers,” Biden, invoked his son, Beau, who was a National Guard veteran and later died of brain cancer.</p>
<p>“My son was not a loser and was not a sucker,” Biden told his predecessor, scowling. “You’re the sucker. You’re the loser.”</p>
<p>Trump denied he ever made the remark, first reported in The Atlantic and confirmed in other reports.</p>
<p>Biden at several times attacked Trump’s credibility and truthfulness, saying after one answer, “Every single thing he said is a lie.”</p>
<p>“I never heard so much malarkey in my whole life,” he said in response to another of Trump’s answers.</p>
<p>Trump brought up the conviction of Biden’s son, Hunter, on federal gun charges this year. And he said that Joe Biden could face prosecution for his performance on border security.</p>
<p>Trump and his legal team <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-floats-return-trial-court-trump-presidential-immunity-case" target="_blank">argued in front of the Supreme Court</a> in April that presidents have absolute immunity from criminal prosecution.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump’s conviction</h4>

	
<p>Thursday’s event was the first presidential debate where one participant was a convicted felon.</p>
<p>A New York state jury in May <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-found-guilty-34-felony-counts-ny-hush-money-trial-10" target="_blank">found Trump guilty</a> of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels for an affair she testified they had that Trump didn’t want to harm his 2016 election prospects.</p>
<p>Trump has denied the affair and it hasn’t affected his support within the GOP, though his sentencing July 11 could affect his campaign strategy.</p>
<p>Trump rejected his criminal conviction during the debate and reiterated his stance that he didn’t have a sexual relationship with an adult film star.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have sex with a porn star,” Trump said, marking the first time such words, or anything near them, have been uttered during a presidential debate.</p>
<p>“I did nothing wrong, we have a system that was rigged and disgusting,” Trump said. “I did nothing wrong.”</p>
<p>Trump also responded to the question by referring to Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>“When he talks about a convicted felon, his son is a convicted felon,” Trump said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jan. 6 disagreement</h4>

	
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court is <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/delayed-supreme-court-ruling-makes-trump-trial-2020-charges-unlikely-election" target="_blank">expected to release a ruling </a>within days in another trial involving Trump, this time on whether presidents enjoy complete immunity from criminal prosecution for their actions while in office.</p>
<p>The justices’ decision will determine whether a federal trial against Trump for election interference stemming from his actions on Jan. 6, 2021 can proceed.</p>
<p>During the debate, Trump said that “on January 6 we were respected all over the world,” but that changed after Biden took office.</p>
<p>Trump seemed to imply that the people who stormed the Capitol building were “innocent” and “patriotic,” saying that “you ought to be ashamed of yourself” for those people being in prison.</p>
<p>Biden said that Trump encouraged the “folks” who attacked the U.S. Capitol building and U.S. Capitol Police officers.</p>
<p>“If they’re convicted, he says he wants to commute their sentences,” Biden said, criticizing Trump’s behavior that day. “These people should be in jail. They should be the ones held accountable.”</p>
<p>Biden rejected the idea that the people who attacked the police and disrupted the electoral certification were patriots.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Divide on abortion rights</h4>

	
<p>Reproductive rights — including access to abortion — sharply divided Biden and Trump, who sparred over which political party’s stance is better.</p>
<p>Trump said that he agreed with the U.S. Supreme Court’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-rejects-attempt-limit-access-abortion-pill-6" target="_blank">decision earlier this month</a> to leave access to mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion, in place. And he said he wouldn’t seek to limit access if elected president in November.</p>
<p>“I agree with their decision to have done that, and I will not block it,” Trump said, adding that the Supreme Court’s earlier decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion was a good thing.</p>
<p>“We brought it back to the states and the country is now coming together on this issue,” Trump said. “It’s been a great thing.”</p>
<p>Trump said he supports exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the woman.</p>
<p>Biden rejected Trump’s classification that Democrats are “radical” on abortion policy and said he supports reinstating the protections that existed under Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>“It’s been a terrible thing,” Biden said of leaving decisions about abortion access up to state lawmakers, comparing it to leaving civil rights decisions up to the states.</p>
<p>Trump said during an interview with Time magazine <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-leaves-door-open-banning-medication-abortion-nationwide" target="_blank">released in April </a>that his campaign was on the brink of releasing a policy regarding mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion. The campaign has yet to release that policy.</p>
<p>Trump suggested that he would be okay with states limiting or barring access to contraception during a May interview with a Pittsburgh TV news station. But he quickly <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signals-hes-open-state-limits-contraceptive-access-then-insists-hes-not" target="_blank">walked back those comments</a> in a social media post.</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank, has suggested that another Trump administration could block the mailing of mifepristone by enforcing the Comstock Act.</p>
<p>The group included the proposal along with dozens of others in Project 2025, its <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank">920-page blueprint</a> for a second Trump administration.</p>
<p>The 1873 anti-obscenity law <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/1873-law-banned-mailing-boxing-photos-could-it-block-abortion-pills-too" target="_blank">hasn’t been enforced in decades </a>and is referred to as a “zombie law” by reproductive rights organizations, but it is still technically a law.</p>
<p>A future Republican attorney general seeking to enforce the law to block the mailing of mifepristone would likely see the law challenged in court, likely working its way up to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Mifepristone is one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortions, which are approved for up to 10 weeks gestation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The two-drug regimen accounts for about 63% of all abortions within the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">First of two debates</h4>

	
<p>The two presidential debates this year are a departure from past years, with both candidates <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-presidential-debates-one-vp-debate-scheduled-ahead-2024-election" target="_blank">ditching the proposed schedule</a> from the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates.</p>
<p>Biden and Trump <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/cnn-sets-first-biden-trump-presidential-debate-june-27-atlanta" target="_blank">later agreed</a> to two debates, the one held Thursday by CNN and another one on Sept. 10 that will be hosted by ABC News.</p>
<p>CNN opted to hold its debate at its studios in Atlanta, Georgia, without an audience. Thursday night’s debate was also earlier than any other presidential debates, which have traditionally begun in September or October.</p>
<p>The television news network created frustration ahead of the debate with the White House Correspondents Association when it decided to keep the pool, the group of journalists that travel everywhere with the president, out of the room.</p>
<p>Kelly O’Donnell, president of the WHCA, released a statement Thursday afternoon that the organization was “deeply concerned that CNN has rejected our repeated requests to include the White House travel pool inside the studio”</p>
<p>“The pool is there for the ‘what ifs?’ in a world where the unexpected does happen,” wrote O’Donnell, who is also the senior White House correspondent for NBC News. “A pool reporter is present to provide context and insight by direct observation and not through the lens of the television production.”</p>
<p>CNN’s rules also said that neither Biden nor Trump was allowed to bring props or pre-written notes into the debate area.</p>
<p>Each stood behind “a uniform podium” and was not allowed to interact with campaign staff during the two commercial breaks.</p>
<p>Biden was scheduled to travel with first lady Jill Biden to Raleigh, North Carolina, immediately after the debate wrapped. They’re set to participate in campaign events on Friday morning before traveling to New York later in the day.</p>
<p>The Bidens are then expected to travel to Red Bank, New Jersey, on Saturday for more campaigning before heading back to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland.</p>
<p>Trump will attend a campaign rally Friday afternoon in Chesapeake, Virginia. In a release announcing the event, Trump criticized Biden on inflation, crime and drug addiction, and immigration.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story that will be updated.</em></p>

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The Democratic National Committee has taken a significant step toward formally designating Joe Biden as the party’s presidential nominee before the Democratic convention in August — a move that’s necessary to place him on the Ohio ballot for November’s election, States Newsroom has been told.</p>
<p>DNC members finalized their vote Thursday to move forward with an all-virtual roll call vote after 360 members voted in favor, two voted against and five abstained, according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p>In addition, the DNC will offer an online portal for Democrats to say what they want to see included in the national party platform as it is constructed ahead of the convention.</p>
<p>DNC Chair Jaime Harrison wrote in a statement that during the first term of the Biden-Harris administration, “we’ve seen the incredible outcomes that can result when democratic ideas are put into action.”</p>
<p>“I’m excited to announce that this year, through our testimony portal, we’ll be able to hear from more Americans and receive more input than ever before as we chart the road to the 2024 Democratic National Convention,” Harrison wrote. “We’ll build a platform that is rooted in the collective experience of Americans and mobilize people to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in November.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virtual roll call</h4>

	
<p>In order to nominate Biden and Harris before the Ohio deadline, the DNC’s Credentials Committee and the Rules Committee will next need to adopt their reports to allow the virtual roll call, which will formally nominate Biden and Harris, to take place before the convention.</p>
<p>The DNC Convention is scheduled to begin in Chicago on Aug. 19, but the state of Ohio <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/05/28/dems-say-they-will-get-around-biden-ohio-ballot-issue-by-holding-virtual-roll-call-before-deadline/" target="_blank">requires that </a>presidential candidates are formally nominated at least 90 days before Election Day.</p>
<p>The DNC is also moving forward with plans to hold some version of the traditional roll call during the convention, though the party is looking to “build on the success” of the roll call vote held during the all-virtual 2020 presidential nominating convention, necessitated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>The DNC spokesperson told States Newsroom that the goal for this year’s convention-week nomination is to pull in more Americans beyond the delegates who are in Chicago at the United Center.</p>
<p>Democrats, the spokesperson said, are looking to revive elements of the 2020 roll call vote, which they called “Roll Call Across America.”</p>
<p>The all-virtual nomination during the 2020 convention featured Democratic delegates voting from historic and sometimes quirky locations.</p>
<p>Those included the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Alabama, the Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station in Delaware, a cornfield in Iowa, an art studio and community center in Louisiana, a field of grazing cattle in Montana, Biden’s childhood home in Pennsylvania and a beach in Rhode Island where a chef held a plate of fried calamari.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic platform </h4>

	
<p>In addition to working toward the nomination of Biden and Harris, the DNC is preparing to build the official Democratic platform in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>The DNC planned to open the online portal Friday that will allow all Democrats to fill out a form detailing what they want to see in this year’s party platform, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>There will be a version in <a href="https://demconvention.com/platform-testimony/" target="_blank">English</a> as well as one in <a href="https://demconvention.com/es/testimonio-para-la-plataforma-del-partido/" target="_blank">Spanish</a>.</p>
<p>The first Platform Committee meeting will be July 16, followed by the Rules Committee meeting on July 19 and the Credentials Committee’s first meeting on July 21.</p>
<p>Those meetings will be held the same week that Republicans gather in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to hold their convention and formally nominate Donald Trump as their presidential candidate.</p>
<p>All the DNC’s committee meetings will be virtual and streamed online for anyone to watch. Each committee includes about 200 people from the 57 states and territories.</p>
<p>The DNC on Friday also <a href="https://democrats.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024-Drafting-Committee-Members.pdf" target="_blank">announced</a> the 15 members of the platform drafting committee.</p>
<p>That list includes Chair Louisa Terrell, former director of the White House Office of Legislative Affairs; former Labor Department Secretary Marty Walsh; Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison; Ted Kaufman, who worked in Biden’s U.S. Senate office before serving as the U.S. senator from Delaware; Jeremy Bash, who previously worked as the chief of staff at the CIA and the U.S. Department of Defense; Rebecca Brocato, who previously worked as a special assistant to Biden and as the National Security Council senior director for legislative affairs; Marla Blunt-Carter, who worked as the projects manager and director of constituent services in Biden’s Senate office as well as the senior adviser and political strategist for U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester; Joelle Gamble, former deputy director of the National Economic Council; Josh Hsu, former counsel and chief legal adviser for Vice President Harris; Angela Kelley, the chief adviser for policy and partnerships at the American Immigration Council and at the American Immigration Lawyers Association; former South Carolina state Sen, Marlon Kimpson; Rohini Kosoglu, former deputy assistant for Biden and domestic policy adviser for Harris; Lori Lodes, executive director at Climate Power, a political organization focused on addressing climate change; Jeff Peck, who worked for Biden on the Senate Judiciary Committee as general counsel and staff director in the late 1980s and early 1990s; Bharat Ramamurti, former deputy director for the National Economic Council; and Hilda Solis, secretary of labor during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>The drafting committee’s first meeting will be July 11. It will be held virtually and available for anyone to watch on the DNC’s YouTube page.</p>
<p>Democratic National Convention Committee Chair Minyon Moore wrote in a statement that during the “final sprint to the 2024 Democratic National Convention, we look forward to drawing upon our party’s rich diversity and hearing from Americans from all walks of life as we chart the course for the next four years under the leadership of President Biden and Vice President Harris.”</p>
<p>“The Democratic Party’s strength is our diversity and, together, we will build a platform that reaffirms who we are as Democrats and sets us on the path to victory once again this November.”</p>

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Top Democratic campaign officials Thursday pressed their case for control of Congress and the White House by pointing toward the upcoming two-year anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the constitutional right to an abortion.</p>
<p>More than a dozen Democrats also introduced legislation in Congress to prevent a future Republican administration from using an 1873 law, known as the Comstock Act, to bar mailing abortion medication.</p>
<p>On a call with reporters, the three campaign leaders said voters must flip the House from red to blue, keep Democrats in control of the Senate against the long odds and ensure President Joe Biden stays in the Oval Office to prevent the GOP from potentially implementing nationwide restrictions on reproductive rights.</p>
<p>Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Vice Chair Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington repeatedly said that Democrats would restore nationwide protections for abortion access if given unified control of government.</p>
<p>They, however, didn’t provide a clear road map for what Democrats would do on reproductive rights, including access to contraception and in vitro fertilization, if divided control of government continues.</p>
<p>Instead, they pointed to what Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, might do in the event voters elect him president during November’s elections.</p>
<p>“We need to be clear that Trump and MAGA Republicans want to ban abortion and they have a plan to do it through executive action without any bill ever passing Congress; because they believe that politicians should have the power to make these decisions for women, whose lives and stories they will never know,” Smith said on the call.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Comstock Act fears</h4>

	
<p>The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, has released “Project 2025,” a lengthy document that outlines what it believes Trump should do during a second term.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign hasn’t endorsed the document or said it would seek to implement it in full or in part, though a former Trump administration official led its development.</p>
<p>The proposal includes using the Comstock Act —  a law enacted more than 150 years ago to prevent the mailing of obscene materials, contraceptives and anything that could produce an abortion — to bar the shipment of medication abortion throughout the United States.</p>
<p>Smith on Thursday introduced a three-page bill that would eliminate that as a possibility, though the legislation may not advance in the Senate and is very unlikely to make it through the GOP-controlled House before November.</p>
<p>Medication abortion, which includes mifepristone and misoprostol, accounts for about 63% of abortions nationwide, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The two pharmaceuticals are also used for miscarriage care. Misoprostol has other medical uses, as well.</p>
<p>The Comstock Act, enacted in 1873, originally barred the mailing of materials considered lewd or obscene at the time, but is written so broadly that it has been used to bar boxing photographs, art and information about contraception.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section1461&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim" target="_blank">law</a> explicitly prohibits mailing “every article or thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use.” Smith’s bill would seek to eliminate those provisions.</p>
<p>Smith, when asked about the Comstock Act on the call Thursday, said the “zombie law” could be used to make medication abortion illegal without a vote in the Congress.</p>
<p>“It’s very clear what their plan is,” Smith said of Republicans. “And so this is another example of the very clear choice that American voters have.”</p>
<p>DelBene, who is leading Democrats’ campaign arm in the House, said on the call that Republicans are already trying to change when and how Americans have access to various reproductive rights by attaching amendments to the must-pass government funding bills.</p>
<p>“This election is fundamentally about our rights, our freedoms, our democracy and our future,” DelBene said. “House Republicans have made it clear they’re willing to do anything to take those away.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A divided Congress predicted</h4>

	
<p>The most likely outcome of November’s elections isn’t currently unified Democratic control in the eyes of some analysts however.</p>
<p>Three experts at Moody’s Analytics released an <a href="https://www.economy.com/getfile?q=EA99E998-560D-4A12-85DE-3727A7EBE9A8&amp;app=download" target="_blank">analysis</a> this week, showing the most probable result is that Biden will remain president with a divided Congress.</p>
<p>That scenario had a 40% probability, while a Republican sweep had a probability of 35%. Trump winning the presidential election and gaining a divided Congress had a 15% probability. A Democratic sweep had a 10% probability, according to the report.</p>
<p>The most likely scenario of Biden remaining president with a split Congress suggests that the GOP would flip the Senate and the Democrats would regain the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>“With the retirement of West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin, the deep-red state will almost surely elect a Republican senator, leaving the Senate evenly divided,” the report states. “But while recent polling shows that Senate races in Arizona, Maryland, Montana, Nevada and Ohio are close, Republicans need to take only one of these seats to regain the majority.”</p>
<p>“Each race has its own story, but helping the Republicans’ cause is angst over inflation and heightened concern over the immigrant crisis at the southern border,” the report adds.</p>
<p>The analysis goes on to say that “federal judicial decisions on redistricting efforts have also leaned in Democrats’ favor, boosting their chances” of regaining control of the House.</p>
<p>“Also, given that incumbents win reelection more than 90% of the time, the relatively high number of congressional retirements relative to previous cycles creates the potential for more change in the body,” the analysis states.</p>
<p>The report details the four outcomes of November’s election as well as the various economic scenarios that would play out under either a Biden or a Trump presidency for the next four years.</p>
<p>The report was written by Chief Economist Mark M. Zandi, Director/Senior Economist Brendan La Cerda and Economist Justin Begley.</p>

(Kena Betancur/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Scientists debated the origins of COVID-19 on Tuesday, trading barbs over whether the bulk of evidence available points to a natural spillover event from a wild animal or a virus designed in a lab and then let loose through an inadvertent leak.</p>
<p>The hearing in front of the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee was part of ongoing efforts in Congress to apply the lessons learned during the pandemic to prevent or blunt the next outbreak.</p>
<p>Gregory Koblentz, associate professor and director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University in Virginia, said during the <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/hearings/origins-of-covid-19-an-examination-of-available-evidence/" target="_blank">two-hour hearing</a> that debate continues in the scientific community about the origins.</p>
<p>“The possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately developed as a biological weapon has been unanimously rejected by all U.S. intelligence agencies,” Koblentz testified. “While the intelligence community is divided on the origin of the pandemic, most of the agencies have determined that the virus was not genetically engineered.”</p>
<p>Residents in Wuhan, China, were first diagnosed with “an atypical pneumonia-like illness” in December 2019, according to a COVID-19 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html" target="_blank">timeline</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Initial cases all appeared linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market at the time, though there has since been much speculation about the types of research taking place at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.</p>
<p>Koblentz said he believes the available evidence points to a spillover event from an animal, though he added a “research-related accident can’t be ruled out at this time.”</p>
<p>The lack of transparency and data from the Chinese government has significantly hindered scientists’ efforts to unify around the origin of COVID-19, he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Scientists battle over lab vs. spillover</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Richard Ebright, board of governors professor of chemistry and chemical biology and laboratory director at the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University in New Jersey, testified he believes a “large preponderance of evidence indicates SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, entered humans through a research incident.”</p>
<p>Ebright also leveled criticism at fellow panelist Robert Garry, who, along with a handful of co-authors, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9" target="_blank">published an opinion article</a> in the journal nature medicine in March 2020, titled “The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2.”</p>
<p>In the commentary, Garry and the other scientists wrote, “we do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.”</p>
<p>Ebright said during Tuesday’s hearing that the opinion article represented “scientific misconduct up to and including fraud,” a characterization that Garry rejected during the hearing.</p>
<p>“The authors were stating their opinion, but that opinion was not well-founded,” Ebright said. “In March of 2020, there was no basis to state that as a conclusion, as opposed to simply being a hypothesis.”</p>
<p>Garry, professor and associate dean of the School of Medicine at Tulane University in Louisiana, argued on behalf of the spillover event during the hearing, testifying that the virus likely didn’t move directly from a bat to humans, but went to an unidentified intermediary animal.</p>
<p>“The bat coronaviruses are viruses that are spread by the gastrointestinal route,” Garry said. “For a virus like this to become a respiratory virus — it’s just going to require too many mutations, too many changes for a bat virus to spill directly over to a human being. That could only really happen in nature with replication through an intermediate animal.”</p>
<p>Garry also defended gain-of-function research during the hearing, arguing that it has had some beneficial impact, though he noted that it does need “appropriate safeguards and restrictions.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers and pundits have used several, often evolving, definitions for gain-of-function research in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The American Society for Microbiology <a href="https://asm.org/getmedia/24ebbde0-d618-4a8a-901c-6e297e6f92aa/HD-918-ASM-GoF-FactSheet-final.pdf" target="_blank">defines</a> it as techniques “used in research to alter the function of an organism in such a way that it is able to do more than it used to do.”</p>
<p>When research is “responsibly performed” on highly transmissible and pathogenic viruses, it can lead to advances in public health and national security, Garry testified.</p>
<p>“Without gain-of-function research, we’d have no Tamiflu. Without gain-of-function research, we wouldn’t have a vaccine to prevent cancer caused by infection by the human papilloma virus,” Garry said. “And without gain-of-function research, we won’t be able to identify how novel viruses infect us. And if we don’t know how they infect us, we cannot develop appropriate treatments and cures for the next potential pandemic creating virus.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Oversight of funding, research </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan raised several questions about whether there’s enough oversight of how the United States spends research dollars as well as what mechanisms are in place to monitor how private entities conduct certain types of research.</p>
<p>“While their research has the potential to cure diseases and boost our economy, unless they accept federal funding, there is very little federal oversight to ensure that private labs are engaged in safe and ethical research,” she said.</p>
<p>Koblentz from George Mason University said there is much less oversight of biosafety and biosecurity for private research facilities that don’t receive federal funding.</p>
<p>“In order to expand the scope of oversight to all privately funded research, (it) would require legislative action,” Koblentz said.</p>
<p>Congress, he said, should establish a national bio-risk management agency that would have authority over biosafety and biosecurity “regardless of the source of funding.”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, it shouldn’t matter where the funding comes from in terms of making sure this research is being done safely, securely and responsibly,” Koblentz said.</p>
<p>Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, ranking member on the committee, said the panel will hold an upcoming hearing specifically on gain-of-function research, including what steps Congress should take to ensure it doesn’t put the public at risk.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The next pandemic</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Committee Chairman Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said during the hearing that lawmakers “must learn from the challenges faced during this pandemic to ensure we can better protect Americans from future potential biological incidents.”</p>
<p>“Our government needs the flexibility to determine the origins of naturally occurring outbreaks, as well as potential outbreaks that could arise from mistakes or malicious intent,” Peters said.</p>
<p>Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney, after listening to some of the debate, expressed exasperation that so much attention is going toward what caused the last pandemic and not on how to prepare for the next one.</p>
<p>“Given the fact that it could have been either, we know what action we ought to take to protect from either,” Romney said. “And so why there’s so much passion around that makes me think it’s more political than scientific, but maybe I’m wrong.”</p>
<p>The United States, he said, shouldn’t be funding gain-of-function research and should “insist” that anyone who receives federal funding follow the standards of the International Organization for Standardization.</p>

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a much-anticipated decision Thursday that mifepristone, one of two pharmaceuticals used in medication abortion, can remain available under current prescribing guidelines.</p>
<p>The high court unanimously rejected attempts by anti-abortion groups to roll back access to what was in place more than eight years ago, writing that they lacked standing to bring the case.</p>
<p>Those limits would have made it more difficult for patients to get a prescription for mifepristone, which the Food and Drug Administration has approved for up to 10 weeks gestation and is used in about 63% of U.S. abortions.</p>
<p>Erin Morrow Hawley, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, who argued the case in front of the court on behalf of the legal organization, doesn’t believe this is the end of efforts to challenge access to mifepristone.</p>
<p>She said on a call shortly after the ruling was released the three states that intervened in a lower court — Idaho, Kansas and Missouri — could still advance their arguments against mifepristone and potentially hold standing, the legal right to bring a case.</p>
<p>“I would expect the litigation to continue with those three states,” Hawley said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Kavanaugh writes opinion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-235_n7ip.pdf" target="_blank">wrote the opinion</a> in the united ruling from the Supreme Court, with Justice Clarence Thomas writing a concurring opinion.</p>
<p>“Plaintiffs are pro-life, oppose elective abortion, and have sincere legal, moral, ideological, and policy objections to mifepristone being prescribed and used by others,” Kavanaugh wrote.</p>
<p>The four anti-abortion medical organizations and four anti-abortion doctors who originally brought the lawsuit against mifepristone have protections in place to guard against being forced to participate in abortions against their moral objections, he noted.</p>
<p>“Not only as a matter of law but also as a matter of fact, the federal conscience laws have protected pro-life doctors ever since FDA approved mifepristone in 2000,” Kavanaugh wrote. “The plaintiffs have not identified any instances where a doctor was required, notwithstanding conscience objections, to perform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment that violated the doctor’s conscience.”</p>
<p>“Nor is there any evidence in the record here of hospitals overriding or failing to accommodate doctors’ conscience objections,” he added.</p>
<p>Alliance Defending Freedom has not “identified any instances where a doctor was required, notwithstanding conscience objections, to perform an abortion or to provide other abortion-related treatment that violated the doctor’s conscience since mifepristone’s 2000 approval,” the opinion said.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh might have also included hints on how the court will rule later this session on <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-justices-appear-split-over-whether-protect-abortion-care-during-emergencies" target="_blank">a separate abortion access case</a> that addresses the Emergency Medical Treatment &amp; Labor Act, known as EMTALA.</p>
<p>“EMTALA does not require doctors to perform abortions or provide abortion-related medical treatment over their conscience objections because EMTALA does not impose obligations on individual doctors,” Kavanaugh wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Thomas agrees but questions who can sue</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Thomas wrote a concurring opinion in the case, saying that he agreed with the court’s unanimous decision, which he did join, but brought up concerns with how a certain type of standing is used by the Court.</p>
<p>“Applying these precedents, the Court explains that the doctors cannot establish third-party standing to sue for violations of their patients’ rights without showing an injury of their own,” Thomas wrote.</p>
<p>“But, there is a far simpler reason to reject this theory: Our third-party standing doctrine is mistaken,” Thomas added. “As I have previously explained, a plaintiff cannot establish an Article III case or controversy by asserting another person’s rights.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reaction pours in</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Politicians, anti-abortion groups and reproductive rights organizations all reacted to the ruling within hours of its release, often pointing to November’s elections as a potential next step.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden released a written statement saying the “decision does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues.”</p>
<p>“It does not change the fact that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, and women lost a fundamental freedom,” Biden added. “It does not change the fact that the right for a woman to get the treatment she needs is imperiled if not impossible in many states.”</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the Republican Party’s presumptive nominee, was in meetings most of Thursday with U.S. House Republicans and then separately with Republican U.S. Senators.</p>
<p>Neither Trump nor his campaign released a statement by early Thursday afternoon addressing the Supreme Court’s ruling.</p>
<p>Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, ranking member on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, wrote in a statement that the justice didn’t actually address the merits of the case.</p>
<p>“The Court did not weigh in on the merits of the case, but the fact remains this is a high risk drug that ends the life of an unborn child,” Cassidy wrote. “I urge FDA to follow the law and reinstate important safeguards.”</p>
<p>President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Stella Dantas related a statement saying the ruling “provides us with long-awaited relief.”</p>
<p>“We now know that patients and clinicians across the country will continue to have access to mifepristone for medication abortion and miscarriage management,” Dantas wrote. “Decades of clinical research have proven mifepristone to be safe and effective, and its strong track record of millions of patient uses confirms that data.”</p>
<p>Hawley from Alliance Defending Freedom wrote in a written statement the organization was “disappointed that the Supreme Court did not reach the merits of the FDA’s lawless removal of commonsense safety standards for abortion drugs.”</p>
<p>“While we’re disappointed with the court’s decision, we will continue to advocate for women and work to restore commonsense safeguards for abortion drugs—like an initial office visit to screen for ectopic pregnancies,” Hawley wrote. “And we are grateful that three states stand ready to hold the FDA accountable for jeopardizing the health and safety of women and girls across this country.”</p>
<p>Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, wrote in a statement she had “both relief and anger about this decision.”</p>
<p>“Thank goodness the Supreme Court unanimously rejected this unwarranted attempt to curtail access to medication abortion, but the fact remains that this meritless case should never have gotten this far,” Northup wrote.</p>
<p>“The FDA’s rulings on medication abortion have been based on irrefutable science,” Northup wrote. “Unfortunately, the attacks on abortion pills will not stop here — the anti-abortion movement sees how critical abortion pills are in this post-Roe world, and they are hell bent on cutting off access.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Scientific evidence argued</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Supreme Court heard <a href="https://tinyurl.com/4h8yfaks" target="_blank">oral arguments </a>in the case in March, during which Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued the FDA’s guidelines for prescribing mifepristone were based on reputable scientific evidence and years of real-world use.</p>
<p>“Only an exceptionally small number of women suffer the kinds of serious complications that could trigger any need for emergency treatment,” Prelogar said. “It’s speculative that any of those women would seek care from the two specific doctors who asserted conscience injuries. And even if that happened, federal conscience protections would guard against the injury the doctors face.”</p>
<p>Hawley of ADF told the court that conscience protections in federal law didn’t do enough to protect anti-abortion doctors from having to possibly treat patients experiencing complications from medication abortion.</p>
<p>“These are emergency situations,” Hawley said. “Respondent doctors don’t necessarily know until they scrub into that operating room whether this may or may not be abortion drug harm — it could be a miscarriage, it could be an ectopic pregnancy, or it could be an elective abortion.”</p>
<p>The case reached the Supreme Court within two years of ADF originally filing the lawsuit in the District Court for the Northern District of Texas, where ADF wrote the FDA “exceeded its regulatory authority” when it originally approved mifepristone in 2000.</p>
<p>ADF filed the case on behalf of Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American College of Pediatricians and Christian Medical &amp; Dental Associations, as well as four doctors from California, Indiana, Michigan and Texas.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Kacsmaryk ruling started journey to high court</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk essentially agreed with the anti-abortion groups, in a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-administration-appeals-judges-ruling-ordering-abortion-pill-us-market" target="_blank">ruling</a> in April 2023, where he wrote he did “not second-guess FDA’s decision-making lightly.”</p>
<p>“But here, FDA acquiesced on its legitimate safety concerns — in violation of its statutory duty — based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions,” Kacsmaryk wrote.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-preserves-access-abortion-pill-lawsuit-continues" target="_blank">issued a stay</a> at the request of the Justice Department, which put the district court’s ruling on hold until the appeal process could work itself out.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also appealed the district court’s ruling to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana, where a three-judge panel <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-panel-us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">heard the case</a> in May 2023.</p>
<p>The panel — composed of Jennifer Walker Elrod, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, as well as James C. Ho and Cory T. Wilson, who were both appointed by former President Donald Trump — <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-pill-stay-market-until-us-supreme-court-ruling-after-appeals-court-order-0" target="_blank">issued its ruling</a> in August 2023.</p>
<p>The appeals court disagreed with the district court’s ruling that mifepristone’s original approval should be overturned, though it said that the FDA erred in making changes to prescribing guidelines in 2016 and 2021.</p>
<p>“It failed to consider the cumulative effect of removing several important safeguards at the same time. It failed to consider whether those ‘major’ and ‘interrelated’ changes might alter the risk profile, such that the agency should continue to mandate reporting of non-fatal adverse events,” the appeals judges wrote. “And it failed to gather evidence that affirmatively showed that mifepristone could be used safely without being prescribed and dispensed in person.”</p>
<p>That ruling didn’t take effect under the Supreme Court’s earlier stay.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice wrote to the high court weeks later in September, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-justice-department-asks-supreme-court-take-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">urging the justices</a> to take up an appeal of the 5th Circuit’s decision.</p>
<p>“The loss of access to mifepristone would be damaging for women and healthcare providers around the Nation,” the DOJ wrote in the 42-page document. “For many patients, mifepristone is the best method to lawfully terminate their early pregnancies. They may choose mifepristone over surgical abortion because of medical necessity, a desire for privacy, or past trauma.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Briefs filed with court</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Dozens of abortion rights organizations and lawmakers filed so-called amicus curiae or friend of the court briefs to the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/dozens-friend-court-briefs-backing-abortion-pill-access-arrive-supreme-court" target="_blank">calling on the justices</a> to keep access to mifepristone in line with the FDA guidelines.</p>
<p>A group of more than 16 medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, wrote that “restricting access to mifepristone will not only jeopardize health, but worsen racial and economic inequities and deprive women of the choices that are at the very core of individual autonomy and wellbeing.”</p>
<p>Anti-abortion groups and lawmakers opposed to mifepristone <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/who-wants-us-supreme-court-limit-abortion-pill-access-heres-list" target="_blank">wrote numerous briefs</a> as well.</p>
<p>Attorneys general from Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming sent in a 28-page brief.</p>
<p>They wrote that the availability of mifepristone undermined states’ rights, since some of their states had sought to restrict abortion below the 10 weeks approved for mifepristone use or had sought to bar access to medication abortion.</p>
<p>“The FDA’s actions undermine these laws, undercut States’ efforts to enforce them, and thus erode the federalism the Constitution deems vital,” the attorneys general wrote. “Given these harms to federalism, this Court should view the FDA’s actions with skepticism.”</p>
<p>During oral arguments in March, several Supreme Court justices brought up conscience protections that insulate health care workers from having to assist with or perform procedures they have a religious objection to, like abortion.</p>
<p>Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she was “worried that there is a significant mismatch in this case between the claimed injury and the remedy that’s being sought.”</p>
<p>“The obvious, common-sense remedy would be to provide them with an exemption that they don’t have to participate in this procedure,” Jackson said.</p>
<p>Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch said the case seemed “like a prime example of turning what could be a small lawsuit into a nationwide legislative assembly on an FDA rule, or any other federal government action.”</p>

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden, speaking from the site of the D-Day invasion in Normandy, France, said Friday that those who support democracy must remember what World War II soldiers sacrificed and live up to those ideals.</p>
<p>Biden’s remarks came during commemoration of the 80th anniversary of D-Day and sought to tie the threats to democracy in the 1940s to those that exist today in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>“American democracy asks the hardest of things — to believe that we’re part of something bigger than ourselves,” Biden said. “So democracy begins with each of us.”</p>
<p>Biden spoke from the Ranger Monument at Pointe du Hoc, where former President Ronald Reagan in 1984 <a href="https://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/ronald-reagan-normandy-speech-point-du-hoc/" target="_blank">delivered a memorable speech</a> on the invasion’s 40th anniversary.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.abmc.gov/Pointe-du-Hoc" target="_blank">monument</a>, constructed by the French, sits eight miles west of the Normandy American Cemetery and was built to honor the members of the American Second Ranger Battalion.</p>
<p>Biden walked in to give the speech alongside Scott Desjardins, the superintendent of the Normandy American Cemetery, who later told reporters that he spoke with the president about the battle.</p>
<p>“I explained to him that when the Rangers were still living, they would tell us climbing up the cliff was not the difficult part,” Desjardins told White House pool reporters. “Holding onto this terrain for two and a half days, being outnumbered, is really the amazing thing about Pointe du Hoc.”</p>
<p>First Sergeant Gavin Stith, U.S. Army, 2nd Ranger Battalion, and his spouse, Kourtney Stith, attended the speech alongside about 150 other people. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken both attended as well.</p>
<p>​Pfc <a href="https://bestdefensefoundation.org/veteran/pfc-john-m-wardell/" target="_blank">John M. Wardell</a>, 99, from New Jersey, who landed in France on June 18, 1944, was seated in the audience as well and spoke with Blinken, according to pool reports.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Standing up to dictators</h4>

	
<p>Biden said during the <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?536195-1/president-biden-delivers-remarks-pointe-du-hoc-normandy-france" target="_blank">12-minute speech</a> the soldiers who stormed the beach in 1944 had decided that it was necessary to stand up to a dictator who threatened democracy in Europe and that people today must live up to that benchmark.</p>
<p>“Does anyone doubt that they would want America to stand up against (Russian leader Vladimir) Putin’s aggression here in Europe today?” Biden asked.</p>
<p>“They fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the &#8217;30s and &#8217;40s,” Biden added. “Does anyone doubt they wouldn’t move heaven and earth to vanquish the hateful ideologies of today? These rangers put mission and country above themselves. Does anyone believe they would exact any less from every American today?”</p>
<p>Biden met earlier in the day with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and announced a $225 million aid package for the country to assist in its war against Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>Biden told Zelenskyy during the meeting that his country’s efforts to win the war are “remarkable” and apologized for how long it took Congress to approve the latest round of military and humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the weeks of not knowing what’s going to pass in terms of funding because we had trouble getting the bill that we had to pass that had the money in it,” Biden said during the Zelenskyy meeting. “Some of our very conservative members were holding it up. But we got it done finally.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Be part of something bigger than ourselves’</h4>

	
<p>Biden said during his speech at Pointe du Hoc the Allied soldiers who scaled those cliffs on D-Day, all of whom are deceased, would ask every American today to “stay true to what America stands for.”</p>
<p>“They’re not asking us to give or risk our lives, but they are asking us to care for others in our country more than ourselves,” Biden said. “They’re not asking us to do their job. They’re asking us to do our job; to protect freedom in our time, to defend democracy, to stand up to aggression abroad and at home, to be part of something bigger than ourselves.”</p>
<p>If Americans wish to honor the sacrifices of our country’s WWII soldiers, they must “ensure that our democracy endures and the soul of our nation endures,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden did not mention the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, by name, but Democrats have repeatedly stressed the danger they believe Trump poses to democracy.</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/80th-anniversary-d-day-invasion-biden-and-macron-honor-wwii-veterans-normandy" target="_blank">spoke Thursday</a> at the Normandy American Cemetery near Omaha Beach about the bravery of the soldiers who stormed the beaches on D-Day and the allied forces who worked together to defeat Nazi Germany and end the Holocaust.</p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — An attempt to reinforce Americans’ access to contraception failed Wednesday when U.S. Senate Republicans blocked a bill from advancing toward final passage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00190.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">51-39 procedural vote </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">required at least 60 senators to move forward, but fell short after GOP lawmakers said the measure was too broad as well as unnecessary. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, both Republicans, broke with their party and voted to advance the legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats argued during debate on the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4381/text" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12-page bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it would provide a safety net should a future Supreme Court overturn two cases that ensure married and unmarried Americans have the right to make decisions about when and how to use contraception. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP senators contended the vote was mere politics and that if Democrats were serious about safeguarding access to contraception for future generations, they’d work with Republicans on a bipartisan bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen said the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion in the Dobbs decision two years ago showed women how quickly things can change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It demonstrated that a fundamental right, the right of women to make decisions over their own bodies, could be taken away in the blink of an eye,” Rosen said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women, she said, can’t rely solely on the Supreme Court to uphold the cases that have guaranteed Americans access to contraception for more than 50 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Contraception has been safely used by millions of women for decades,” Rosen said. “It’s allowed women to take control over their own bodies — to decide when they want to start a family, how many kids they have, who they want to start a family with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For these very same reasons, the right to contraception has been a target of anti-choice extremists for years,” Rosen added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Whip John Thune, the South Dakota Republican seeking to become the chamber’s next GOP leader, said the bill was meant to “provide a talking point for Democratic candidates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These votes have nothing to do with legislating and everything to do with boosting Democrats’ electoral chances, he hopes, in this fall’s election,” Thune said, referring to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation was a non-starter with many Republicans, Thune said, because it didn’t carve out the conscience protections that exist under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/house-bill/1308#:~:text=Religious%20Freedom%20Restoration%20Act%20of%201993%20%2D%20Prohibits%20any%20agency%2C%20department,government%20may%20burden%20a%20person's" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal law,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enacted in 1993 after being sponsored by Schumer, established “a heightened standard of review for government actions that substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sales of contraceptives</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats’ bill would have protected “an individual’s ability to access contraceptives” and “a health care provider’s ability to provide contraceptives, contraception, and information related to contraception.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would have barred state and federal governments from prohibiting the sale of any contraceptives or blocking “any individual from aiding another individual in voluntarily obtaining or using any contraceptives or contraceptive methods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill defined contraception as “an action taken to prevent pregnancy, including the use of contraceptives or fertility-awareness-based methods and sterilization procedures.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Democrats </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-decry-limits-abortion-access-house-dems-unveil-contraception-bill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced an identical bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in that chamber on Tuesday, though it’s unlikely to get a vote while Republicans remain in control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Larry Sabato, who heads the Center For Politics at the University of Virginia, called the effort “a good move for Democrats” to still try. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem they&#8217;re going to have is most people don&#8217;t believe that Republicans would actually [prohibit birth control],” Sabato said. “Now the obvious comeback for that is ‘Well, did you think they would abolish Roe v Wade?’ Because people didn&#8217;t believe that either — and then it happened.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since the overturn of federal abortion protections, access to contraception has come into question as </span><a href="https://stateline.org/2022/05/19/some-states-already-are-targeting-birth-control/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some states have targeted it </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and a recent Alabama Supreme Court</span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/02/19/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-in-state/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared embryos used for in vitro fertilization as people.</span><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the vote on the contraception bill, Schumer moved to schedule a procedural vote next week on legislation that would guarantee access to in vitro fertilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schumer said during a press conference afterward that vote would give Americans an opportunity to “see where Republicans stand on the so very important issue” of reproductive rights.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Supreme Court opinion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supreme Court Associate Justice Clarence Thomas stirred up concerns about access to contraception two years ago when he wrote a </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concurring opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Dobbs case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas wrote that the justices should “reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the other nine justices joined Thomas in writing that opinion, likely signaling they didn’t agree with some or all of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut case was the first time the court recognized that married couples’ constitutional privacy rights extend to decisions about contraception. That ruling struck down a Connecticut state law that barred access to contraceptives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court, in 1972, extended the right to make private decisions about contraception to unmarried people in the Eisenstadt v. Baird ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the release of Thomas’ concurring opinion, Democrats and reproductive rights organizations immediately began pressing for federal laws that would reinforce current contraception access. Congress has not passed any so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mini Timmaraju, president and chief executive officer of Reproductive Freedom for All, said during a press conference with Senate Democrats on Wednesday before the vote that women should talk with their mothers and grandmothers about when they were first able to obtain birth control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we talk about the generations of women in this country who didn’t have access to birth control, we’re just talking about my mother’s generation — 1965,” Timmaraju said. “It was not that long ago and that should really be a wake-up call.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">White House, Biden campaign weigh in</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration signaled its support for Senate Democrats’ bill hours before the vote, writing in a </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SAP-S4381.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statement of Administration Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the measure “would protect the fundamental right to access contraception and help ensure that women can make decisions about their health, lives, and families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Women must have the freedom to make deeply personal health care decisions, including the right to decide if and when to start or grow their family,” the policy states. “Now is the time to safeguard the right to contraception once and for all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden-Harris campaign held a press call on reproductive rights Wednesday morning to highlight the differences between the presidential candidates on reproductive rights, including access to abortion, contraception and in vitro fertilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden-Harris Campaign Manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said during the call that Donald Trump, Republicans’ presumptive nominee for president, couldn’t be further away from Biden on access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez said Trump’s </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-leaves-door-open-banning-medication-abortion-nationwide" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during an interview with TIME magazine in April and his </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signals-hes-open-state-limits-contraceptive-access-then-insists-hes-not" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a local Pennsylvania TV news station in May show he’s not supportive of women’s reproductive rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decisions about contraception, abortion and in vitro fertilization belong to women and their doctors, “not politicians and the government,” Rodriguez said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, a member of the Biden-Harris campaign’s advisory board, said on the call this year’s election will be a “defining moment” for the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican efforts to restrict access to reproductive health care, he said, mean they are trying to “control women.” </span></p>

Joni Ernst said during debate on the bill that Democrats’ legislation went too far and pressed for the Senate to take up </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4447/text?s=5&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22ernst%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill she introduced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure has since gained nine co-sponsors including Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Steve Daines of Montana, Todd Young of Indiana, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, James E. Risch of Idaho and John Cornyn of Texas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Republican Rep. Ashley Hinson plans to introduce the companion bill in the House, according to an announcement from Ernst’s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With my bill, we’re ensuring women 18 and over can walk into any pharmacy, whether in Red Oak, Iowa, or Washington, D.C., and purchase a safe and effective birth control option,” Ernst said. “This Republican bill creates a priority review designation for over-the-counter birth control options to encourage the FDA to act quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ernst said she was “encouraged” that one over-the-counter oral contraceptive has been approved and is available, but that should be “just a starting point.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four-page bill would encourage the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve additional over-the-counter oral contraceptives and “direct the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a study on federal funding of contraceptive methods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation would require the secretary of the Health and Human Services Department to give priority review to a supplemental application for oral contraceptives “intended for routine use.” But it does not extend that to “any emergency contraceptive drug” or “any drug that is also approved for induced abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access to over-the-counter oral birth control that receives FDA approval so that it no longer requires a prescription would be available for people over 18.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States, including Virginia, can still control contraceptives access — for now</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While federal politicians continue their back and forth over legislating contraception access, states can still take their own stances on the matter. Virginia already tried to do so earlier this year in a measure that cleared both the House of Delegates and state Senate before being vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, joined Schumer and the other U.S. senators Wednesday for a press conference outside of the Capitol. She had carried Virginia’s own right-to-contraception act months prior. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had stated support for contraception and initially attempted to amend Price’s bill. While hers would have codified protections whether or not the Griswold and Eisenstadt rulings are upheld or repealed, his amendment — which the legislature rejected — would have aligned Virginia with the rulings. He then vetoed the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gov. Younkin unfortunately taught us again that actions mean more than words,” she said Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, U.S. Sen Tim Kaine, D-Va., said in a call with States Newsroom affiliate the Virginia Mercury that he was not surprised the state measure passed with bipartisan support, but that he was surprised to see Youngkin veto it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you really want to reduce abortions, contraception access is a way to do it,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price and Virginia state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, plan to reintroduce their proposal during Virginia&#8217;s next legislative session and again until it is passed. As Virginia governors cannot serve consecutive terms, a new person will be elected to helm the state come 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians may still have hope since we will soon have a new governor due to our own state term limits,” Price said. “But other states may be stuck with governors like him for years.”</span></p>

Ayanna Pressley speaks during a press conference on reproductive rights for people with disabilities outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, May 23, 2024. (Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Three members of Congress introduced a resolution Thursday that’s intended to bring attention to the experiences and challenges people with disabilities face when it comes to reproductive rights.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley announced the resolution during a press conference with advocates just steps from the U.S. Capitol, saying that under a Supreme Court ruling still in effect, people with disabilities can be sterilized without their consent.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/buck-v-bell-1927/" target="_blank">Buck v. Bell</a> is a decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the court ruled on May 2, 1927, affirming the constitutionality of Virginia’s law allowing state-enforced sterilization,” Pressley said.</p>
<p>Pressley said people outside of the disability rights community often aren’t aware of the ruling or the fact it has never been challenged.</p>
<p>“They’re in disbelief that this even happened and that this ruling authorizes involuntary sterilization of people with disabilities and has never been overturned,” Pressley said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unique barriers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://pressley.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Disability-Reproductive-Equity-Day-2024.pdf" target="_blank">four-page resolution</a> would designate one day in May as Disability Reproductive Equity Day.</p>
<p>The resolution says that “people with disabilities face unique barriers when accessing reproductive health care,” including harmful stereotypes, communication barriers and a lack of accessible health care facilities, among other obstacles.</p>
<p>It adds that Congress “pledges to advance the right of people with disabilities to reproductive and sexual health, autonomy, and freedom.”</p>
<p>Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth and Washington Democratic Sen. Patty Murray introduced the companion resolution in that chamber.</p>
<p>Murray wrote in a statement announcing the introduction that “Americans with disabilities have long had to jump through extra hoops and faced real discrimination when it comes to accessing the health care they need, including abortion care.”</p>
<p>“Access to reproductive health care has been in crisis since the Dobbs decision, making it even harder for people with disabilities to access high-quality care from providers who understand their health care needs,” Murray wrote. “It’s important that we recognize the barriers millions of women face in accessing reproductive health care, and this resolution is an important marker for us all to recommit to the fight for reproductive justice for all.”</p>
<p>Co-sponsors in the House include New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, Pennsylvania Rep. Madeleine Dean and Washington Rep. Adam Smith. All are Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Access to full slate of care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Rebecca Cokley, a disability advocate and former executive director of the National Council on Disability, told a story during the press conference about how after having her middle child, the anesthesiologist told the OB-GYN to “tie her tubes,” adding that “people like her don’t need to have any more babies.”</p>
<p>Cokley said her OB-GYN could have “advocated for that and it would have been perfectly legal.”</p>
<p>“When we talk about reproductive justice, it’s about the idea that all women, all people have the right to have children, the right to not have children.” Cokley said. “The right to nurture the children we have in a safe and healthy environment.”</p>
<p>Jess Davidson, communications director at the American Association of People with Disabilities, discussed how access to the full slate of reproductive health care, including abortion, is crucial for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Members of the community, she said, “have an 11 times greater risk of mortality from pregnancy.”</p>
<p>“I know all too well the fear that comes with living with that kind of risk,” Davidson said. “I felt deep in my bones as a young woman that I was made for motherhood.”</p>
<p>After being diagnosed with an illness in her mid-20s that significantly increased her chances of miscarriage or maternal mortality, Davidson said she spoke with her doctor about whether or not she should ever get pregnant.</p>
<p>“I was devastated when I first learned this, but my doctor assured me that if I was willing to get an abortion if it were necessary to save my life and work closely with a high-risk obstetrician, that I could try and see how it went,” Davidson said. “After all, every person and every pregnancy is different.”</p>
<p>That was all before the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to an abortion that had stood for nearly 50 years under two prior rulings.</p>
<p>“Now when I think about attempting a high-risk pregnancy, I feel so fearful that it feels like I can’t breathe,” she said. “And I am someone who lives in Colorado and Washington, D.C., two places where my right to that life-saving care is still intact.”</p>
<p>Many people with disabilities who want to have children, Davidson said, now live in states that ban or significantly restrict abortion access, even if continuing a pregnancy threatens their life or health.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Forced sterilization in state laws</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Ma’ayan Anafi, senior counsel for health equity and justice at the National Women’s Law Center, said that <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/%C6%92.NWLC_SterilizationReport_2022_Appendix.pdf" target="_blank">31 states have laws in place</a> that allow forced sterilization of people with disabilities.</p>
<p>“These laws give judges the power to disregard a disabled person’s wishes and make the decision for them, supposedly for their own good,” Anafi said.</p>
<p>“In doing so they echo many of the same harmful narratives that fueled forced sterilizations … that disabled people can’t or shouldn’t make decisions about their bodies and parenting,” Anafi added. “And that it’s justifiable to take those choices away to protect disabled people from themselves.”</p>
<p><em>Clarification</em>: After publication, Rebecca Cokley’s affiliation was changed at the request of Pressley’s office and the Center for American Progress. Both said Cokley was appearing in her personal and not her professional capacity.</p>

(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan emergency spending law Wednesday to provide an additional $95 billion in aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, ending months of behind-the-scenes maneuvering and public pleas for Congress to approve the funding.</p>
<p>The package also included a measure requiring the popular app TikTok be sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, or face a possible ban.</p>
<p>“It should have been easier and it should have gotten there sooner,” Biden said of the spending. “But in the end, we did what America always does — we rose to the moment, we came together and we got it done.”</p>
<p>The foreign aid funding, he said, was not just an investment in the security of American allies but of the United States itself.</p>
<p>“We’re sending Ukraine equipment from our own stockpiles, then we’ll replenish those stockpiles with new products made by American companies here in America,” Biden said. “Patriot missiles made in Arizona, javelins made in Alabama, artillery shells made in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.”</p>
<p>Biden reiterated that America’s commitment to Israel is “ironclad” and that he would ensure “Israel has what it needs to defend itself against Iran and the terrorists that it supports.”</p>
<p>He also called on Israel to ensure that humanitarian aid can reach civilians in Gaza, who are “suffering the consequences of this war that Hamas started.”</p>
<p>“Israel must make sure all this aid reaches the Palestinians in Gaza without delay,” Biden said. “And everything we do is guided by the ultimate goal of bringing these hostages home, securing a ceasefire and setting the conditions for an enduring peace.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3754238/biden-administration-announces-significant-new-security-assistance-for-ukraine/" target="_blank">announced</a> a $1 billion military assistance package for Ukraine minutes after Biden signed the law that includes “air defense interceptors, artillery rounds, armored vehicles, and anti-tank weapons.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Six months of fighting over assistance</h4>

	
<p>Congress has spent the last six months debating the best way to pass the aid, after Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/israel-ukraine-global-aid-and-border-funding-would-hit-106-billion-under-biden-request" target="_blank">sent an emergency spending request </a>to lawmakers in October.</p>
<p>Republican leaders in the House and Senate insisted that changes to border security and immigration laws accompany the military and humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy and Arizona independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema huddled for months before <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/details-proposed-major-overhaul-us-immigration-law-global-aid-package-unveiled" target="_blank">reaching a deal.</a></p>
<p>But former Republican President Donald Trump urged GOP lawmakers to block the bill from advancing in the Senate amid concerns that it would provide a win to the Biden administration in a policy area that weighs heavily for many voters.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-kills-immigration-overhaul-hits-stalemate-israel-ukraine-aid" target="_blank">Senate Republicans blocked a package</a> that included the bipartisan border security bill, that chamber moved to pass a $95 billion emergency spending package with aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.</p>
<p>That measure <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-sends-house-95-billion-aid-package-ukraine-israel-taiwan" target="_blank">passed</a> in February, but spent the next two months stalled in the House as Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, held a series of meetings on whether that chamber should act.</p>
<p>Johnson ultimately decided to move forward, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-rolls-out-aid-ukraine-israel-votes-planned-tiktok-border-security" target="_blank">releasing four bills </a>that would each receive separate votes, before being bundled as one package and sent to the Senate.</p>
<p>The $95 billion in aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan was strikingly similar to the Senate bill with an exception that economic aid for Ukraine be categorized as a forgivable loan.</p>
<p>The House <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/aid-ukraine-israel-overwhelmingly-approved-us-house-bipartisan-vote" target="_blank">voted Saturday</a> to approve all four bills on broadly bipartisan votes and the Senate <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-sends-foreign-aid-bill-biden-mcconnell-chides-gop-isolationist-movement" target="_blank">voted Tuesday night</a> to send the package to Biden’s desk.</p>
<p>House GOP leaders added a measure to the emergency spending bills — called the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-tries-anew-force-sale-or-ban-tiktok-spy-balloon-your-phone" target="_blank">21st Century Peace through Strength Act</a> — that wrapped together numerous bills, including the one that requires ByteDance to sell the social media app within one year or face a possible ban within the United States.</p>
<p>Washington Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, chairwoman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, said Tuesday that she found it “disturbing” the Chinese government “used TikTok to repeatedly access U.S. user data and track multiple journalists covering the company.”</p>
<p>“As of December 2023, an analysis by Rutgers University found that TikTok posts mentioning topics that are sensitive to the Chinese Government, including Tiananmen Square, Uighurs, and the Dalai Lama were significantly less prevalent on TikTok than on Instagram, the most comparable social media,” Cantwell said.</p>
<p>“Foreign policy issues disfavored by China and Russian Governments also had fewer hashtags on TikTok, such as pro-Ukraine or pro-Israel hashtags,” she added.</p>
<p>Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said Tuesday that “it is not hard to imagine how a platform that facilitates so much commerce, political discourse and social debate could be covertly manipulated to serve the goals of an authoritarian regime, one with a long track record of censorship, transnational oppression and promotion of disinformation.”</p>

Marjorie Taylor Greene speaks with reporters on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, April 18, 2024. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House Democrats on Thursday began coalescing behind Republican Speaker Mike Johnson’s plan to provide assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan through a series of three bills, though far-right members of his own party grew increasingly frustrated with the Louisianan’s bipartisan streak.</p>
<p>Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is leading an effort to remove Johnson as speaker, told reporters that Johnson is maneuvering behind the scenes to possibly change the process that allows one member to call for a vote to remove the speaker. That is “unprecedented” and “completely wrong,” she said.</p>
<p>“If he wants to change the motion to vacate, he needs to come before the Republican Conference that elected him and tell us of his intentions,” Greene said.</p>
<p>“And I’ll tell you something, Kevin McCarthy, while he was staring down the barrel of a loaded gun, he never made a move like this behind closed doors and made deals with Democrats to change the motion to vacate,” Greene said, referring to the former House speaker who was ousted by Republicans last year. “And we’re hearing that’s exactly what Mike Johnson is doing.”</p>
<p>The motion to vacate currently allows any one member of the House to call for a floor vote to remove the speaker from the leadership post.</p>
<p>Greene said Thursday morning that Johnson is considering altering that motion to vacate process to make it more difficult to accomplish. That could cut off Greene and other far-right members from removing him for advancing foreign aid long sought by Democrats and backed by the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Johnson announced late Thursday afternoon that he wouldn’t be taking that step right now, though that’s unlikely to assuage concerns about his leadership style from far-right members.</p>
<p>“Since the beginning of the 118th Congress, the House rule allowing a Motion to Vacate from a single member has harmed this office and our House majority,” Johnson wrote in <a href="https://twitter.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/1781046790684336470" target="_blank">a social media post</a>.</p>
<p>“Recently, many members have encouraged me to endorse a new rule to raise this threshold. While I understand the importance of that idea, any rule change requires a majority of the full House, which we do not have,” Johnson added. “We will continue to govern under the existing rules.”</p>
<p>Johnson said during a press conference on Wednesday evening that he wouldn’t allow speculation about a motion to vacate to dictate how he runs the House.</p>
<p>“My philosophy is you do the right thing and you let the chips fall where they may,” Johnson said. “If I operated out of fear over a motion to vacate, I would never be able to do my job.”</p>
<p>Johnson said providing “lethal aid” to Ukraine is the right thing to do at this point in history and that it could help deter Russia from attacking a NATO country, which could pull U.S. troops into direct conflict with that country.</p>
<p>“To put it bluntly, I would rather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys,” Johnson said. “My son is going to begin at the Naval Academy this fall. This is a live-fire exercise for me, as it is for so many American families. This is not a game. It’s not a joke. We can’t play politics with this.”</p>
<p><strong>McCarthy removal</strong></p>
<p>Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz used the motion to vacate last October to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">remove McCarthy from the role </a>following a floor vote. That caused weeks of internal turmoil and public embarrassment for House Republicans as they struggled to coalesce around a candidate who could win the support needed on the floor.</p>
<p>Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Good, chairman of the far-right Freedom Caucus, said Thursday that lawmakers frustrated with Johnson should wait until after the November elections before debating leadership changes.</p>
<p>“I think the speaker guarantees himself that there will be a contest for the speaker, I hope in November,” Good said. “I think that’s the wise course when you’re sitting at a 216-to-213 margin. But, obviously, I can’t predict what the other members will or won’t do.”</p>
<p>Johnson should have used “leverage points” like the annual defense authorization bill, the annual government funding bills and Ukraine aid to force the Democratic- controlled Senate to take up a stalled House GOP border security bill, he said.</p>
<p>Good also reiterated he is not backing the motion to vacate that Greene <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-files-resolution-oust-mike-johnson-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">filed in March</a> and Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-rep-massie-joins-move-oust-speaker-johnson-who-vows-i-am-not-resigning" target="_blank">decided to support</a> this week after calling on Johnson to resign.</p>

<p>The increased attention on the motion to vacate comes as Johnson looks toward a Saturday vote on <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-rolls-out-aid-ukraine-israel-votes-planned-tiktok-border-security" target="_blank">$95 billion in assistance for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan</a> that would be approved in three separate bills.</p>
<p>The House is expected to vote on a separate bill wrapping together a ban on the social media app TikTok unless it’s sold by Chinese owner ByteDance and sanctions against Iran, Russia and China.</p>
<p>If all four of those bills pass the House, they’re likely to be wrapped together in one package before being sent to the Senate.</p>
<p>The House might take a separate vote on a border security measure that reinstates Trump-era immigration policies, though that didn’t appear to have the votes needed to move to the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p><strong>Democrats warm to GOP leadership</strong></p>
<p>Numerous Democrats indicated in interviews Thursday that they’re willing to help House GOP leaders move past the procedural hurdle of approving a rule in order to move onto final votes on the emergency aid.</p>
<p>Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin said it’s “paramount” that Congress pass assistance for Ukraine after months of inaction and “dislodge all of the dysfunction over on the GOP side.”</p>
<p>“We want to be able to get aid to our allies as quickly as possible and we want to try to stabilize a very chaotic and dysfunctional political environment that has been unleashed on us,” Raskin said.</p>
<p>Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she’s reached a point where she’s fine breaking up aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan into three bills if that’s what it takes to get the legislation through the divided Congress.</p>
<p>“We have to all have the courage to take risks, to spend political capital and to make sure that we can literally save democracy and thousands of people from walking to their doom,” she said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-sends-house-95-billion-aid-package-ukraine-israel-taiwan" target="_blank">approved one bill </a>that included all the aid in February on a 70-29 <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00048.htm" target="_blank">vote</a>, but that has been stuck in the House ever since as Johnson sought a path forward that was acceptable for most of his conference.</p>
<p>Rep. Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat and former House majority leader, said he expects his party to back the rule and the bills, providing broadly bipartisan votes.</p>
<p>“We want this to pass,” Hoyer said. “We think it needs to pass and we think it needs to pass now. And I believe you will see the support of efforts that accomplish that.”</p>
<p>Democrats would also likely back changing the single-member motion to vacate since it’s “destabilizing demonstrably to the House of Representatives,” Hoyer said.</p>
<p>Hoyer said such a change to House rules should be taken up on its own, but he said Democrats might not object to it being approved within a rule, should House GOP leaders take that path.</p>
<p>“You know, one of the things about democracy is you elect a leader and that leader has a term, in this case two years,” Hoyer said. “And to constantly be subjecting a leader to second guessing every day … is bad for the House, bad for the American people.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Brendan Boyle said Johnson deserves credit for the comments made during a Wednesday press conference about doing what’s best and not thinking about how it might affect his role as speaker.</p>
<p>“From 1945 until Donald Trump took over the Republican Party, it has always been the bipartisan consensus foreign policy of the United States that we stand up against Soviet and now Russian aggression, that we lead the Trans-Atlantic alliance, that we are the biggest supporters of NATO and the leaders of NATO,” Boyle said.</p>
<p>After Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Boyle said the former president “suddenly changed the base of that party almost overnight from that position to one that is much more isolationist.”</p>

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The same U.S. Supreme Court that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion will hear oral arguments Tuesday over access to mifepristone, a pharmaceutical used in both medication abortion and miscarriage care.</p>
<p>The nine justices will then decide whether to leave access to the drug intact or require the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to revert prescribing instructions to what were in place before 2016.</p>
<p>The court decision will affect the entire country, including states that have sought to shore up access to reproductive rights following the Dobbs ruling less than two years ago.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court opinion, likely not to come until late spring, will land in the middle of a presidential campaign in which Democrats are elevating the question of reproductive rights. The debate is also likely to affect GOP efforts to grow their majority in the U.S. House and flip the Senate red.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trend toward medication abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Medication abortion, a two-drug regimen that uses mifepristone and misoprostol, was used in 63% of abortions in the United States during 2023, according to a <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/2024/03/medication-abortion-accounted-63-all-us-abortions-2023-increase-53-2020?utm_source=Guttmacher+Email+Alerts&amp;utm_campaign=afd25dbc2c-march_provision_study_gupdate&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_9ac83dc920-afd25dbc2c-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D" target="_blank">report</a> released earlier this month by the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OdrO3BOL4w"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/20/medication-abortion-rates-grew-10-over-the-last-few-years-report-shows/">Medication abortion rates grew 10% over the last few years, report shows</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Medication abortion rates grew 10% over the last few years, report shows&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/20/medication-abortion-rates-grew-10-over-the-last-few-years-report-shows/embed/#?secret=L0bJ5qCEsS#?secret=OdrO3BOL4w" data-secret="OdrO3BOL4w" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The new data shows a continued trend away from procedural abortions and toward medication abortion, which is approved up to 10 weeks gestation, that has been steadily increasing since the FDA originally approved mifepristone in 2000.</p>
<p>Medication abortions accounted for about 6% of pregnancy terminations in 2001, rising to 24% in 2011, before reaching 53% in 2020, according to Guttmacher.</p>
<p>During the last calendar year, the report says there were 1,026,690 abortions throughout the country, with 642,700 of those being medication abortions.</p>
<p>The numbers may not represent the full picture, however.</p>
<p>“The medication abortion counts for 2023 do not include self-managed medication abortions that take place outside of the formal health care system or abortion medication mailed to people in states with total abortion bans,” the Guttmacher report states. “While there are no comprehensive data on the number of self-managed medication abortions in the United States, evidence suggests they have been increasing in the past several years.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Alliance Defending Freedom suit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The case about to go in front of the Supreme Court, Food and Drug Administration v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, began in November 2022 when Alliance Defending Freedom sued the FDA on behalf of four anti-abortion medical organizations and four anti-abortion doctors.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-could-decide-soon-february-yank-abortion-pill-nationwide" target="_blank">original lawsuit</a> and numerous briefs since then, ADF argued that mifepristone leads to problematic situations for doctors who have to assist patients with complications from medication abortions. They’ve also made claims about safety, which have been repeatedly refuted by major medical organizations.</p>
<p>The lawsuit had called for the judicial system to overturn the FDA’s original 2000 approval of mifepristone, which U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk essentially agreed with, in his April 2023 <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-administration-appeals-judges-ruling-ordering-abortion-pill-us-market" target="_blank">ruling</a>.</p>
<p>The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, heard <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-panel-us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">oral arguments in the federal government’s appeal</a> of that ruling in May 2023 before issuing its decision a few months later in August.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-pill-stay-market-until-us-supreme-court-ruling-after-appeals-court-order-0" target="_blank">three-judge panel said</a> mifepristone could stay on the market, but that when and how patients can access the drug should go back to what was in place before the FDA began making changes in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Telehealth and prescriptions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>That would lower the maximum gestational age for using mifepristone from 10 weeks to seven weeks as well as remove the option for patients to get the prescription via telehealth and have it mailed to their homes.</p>
<p>Only doctors would be able to prescribe mifepristone, not health care professionals authorized to prescribe pharmaceuticals, like physician’s assistants or nurse practitioners.</p>
<p>Patents would have to go back to attending three, in-person doctor’s appointments in order to complete the process.</p>
<p>The dosage of mifepristone and the second pharmaceutical used in medication abortions, misoprostol, were different before the changes began to take effect.</p>
<p>The lower courts’ rulings never took effect and the appeals court’s ruling will remain on hold until the Supreme Court issues its opinion in the case, likely this summer.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Briefs filed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Dozens of organizations, attorneys general and lawmakers have filed briefs with the Supreme Court seeking to inform the justices’ thinking in the case ahead of Tuesday’s oral arguments.</p>
<p>More than 15 major medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, sought to reinforce the FDA’s determination that mifepristone is safe and effective in their brief.</p>
<p>“Restricting access to mifepristone will not only jeopardize health, but worsen racial and economic inequities and deprive women of the choices that are at the very core of individual autonomy and wellbeing,” the medical organizations wrote.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CnhXHuTOGQ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/08/abortion-providers-sue-fda-over-abortion-pill-restrictions-in-virginia-montana-kansas/">Abortion providers sue FDA over abortion pill restrictions in Virginia, Montana, Kansas</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Abortion providers sue FDA over abortion pill restrictions in Virginia, Montana, Kansas&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/08/abortion-providers-sue-fda-over-abortion-pill-restrictions-in-virginia-montana-kansas/embed/#?secret=9FbAdDizul#?secret=CnhXHuTOGQ" data-secret="CnhXHuTOGQ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>They noted that “major adverse events occur in less than 0.32% of patients,” and that the “risk of death is almost non-existent.”</p>
<p>About 145 Members of Congress from 36 states urged the court to restrict access to mifepristone in a separate brief filed with the court.</p>
<p>“Since 2016, the FDA has only required adverse events reporting for deaths resulting from chemical abortion drugs; reporting is otherwise voluntary,” the members of Congress wrote, making the argument that reports are not required for injuries or impairment. “This action was not only arbitrary and capricious, but it also raised safety concerns for women seeking chemical abortion drugs.”</p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Congressional staff were scrambling Wednesday to finalize sweeping legislation that would fund much of the federal government, but time was running short ahead of a Friday midnight deadline.</p>
<p>Leaders of the House and Senate and the Biden administration announced Tuesday they’d reached consensus on the final six government funding bills for the fiscal year that began back on Oct. 1. But neither chamber can vote on the agreement until the text of the package — which includes billions in crucial funding for health, defense, immigration and much more — is finished and released.</p>
<p>Lawmakers may need to pass another short-term stopgap spending bill, sometimes called a continuing resolution, or CR, to avoid a funding lapse when the current funding patch expires just as Saturday begins.</p>
<p>“We don’t yet know precisely when the House will act, but as soon as they send us the funding package I will put it on the Senate floor,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>“And from there — as we all know — it will take cooperation to get on the bill and consent from every senator to keep this process moving quickly.”</p>
<p>The New York Democrat said that even if senators from both political parties move with purpose, “it’s going to be a tight squeeze to get this funding package passed before the weekend deadline.”</p>
<p>Schumer asked senators “to be flexible, to be prepared to act quickly and to prioritize working together in good faith, so we can finish the appropriations process.”</p>
<p>If senators act in the same manner they did earlier this month <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-sends-biden-giant-spending-package-hours-midnight-deadline" target="_blank">when the Senate approved the other six spending bills </a>just hours before their deadline, Schumer said, “the odds are good we can get this done without excessive delay or headaches.”</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson said during a press conference Wednesday morning that he expected the text of the legislation to come out later in the day.</p>
<p>The Louisiana Republican said he hoped that chamber would be able to wrap up work before the deadline Friday and predicted Congress wouldn’t need to pass another stopgap spending bill to avoid a weekend funding lapse.</p>
<p>“We should have the bill text, hopefully, by this afternoon,” Johnson said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Deadline after deadline</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Congress has been pushing off its deadline to wrap up work on the dozen annual appropriations bills since the start of fiscal year 2024 last autumn, using a series of CRs to keep funding flat with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>Lawmakers were able to reach a bipartisan agreement on six of the spending bills in early March, quickly <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-sends-biden-giant-spending-package-hours-midnight-deadline" target="_blank">holding broadly bipartisan votes</a> to approve the package in the House and Senate.</p>
<p>Once lawmakers approve the final six spending bills and President Joe Biden signs the package, both chambers of Congress will likely begin work in earnest on the fiscal 2025 process ahead of their next Oct. 1 deadline.</p>
<p>Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-calls-expanded-child-tax-credit-taxes-wealthy-73-trillion-budget-plan" target="_blank">submitted his budget request </a>earlier this month, which was followed by White House budget director Shalanda Young <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-budget-director-says-biden-plan-would-give-working-families-shot" target="_blank">testifying</a> in front of the Senate Budget Committee on the proposal.</p>
<p>The House Appropriations Committee began hearings this week with Cabinet secretaries and agency heads on their funding requests for the next round of appropriations bills. The Senate panel will likely begin those hearings in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Overseas assistance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The House will also turn its attention toward approving emergency assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan in some form after wrapping up work on the current appropriations process, Johnson said Wednesday during his press conference.</p>
<p>“We had to get the approps done first and having done that now we’ll turn our attention to it. And we won’t delay on that,” he said.</p>
<p>Johnson didn’t say exactly what form aid would take or how much funding a House bill would provide, but did say there are a “a number of avenues” that Republicans have been considering.</p>
<p>“We’re talking about the whole supplemental and all of these pieces — whether they’d go individually or as a package — all of those things are being debated and discussed,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>There are ongoing conversations among House GOP lawmakers about possibly using seized Russian assets and a loan to provide Ukraine with additional assistance, Johnson said.</p>
<p>The Senate in February <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-sends-house-95-billion-aid-package-ukraine-israel-taiwan" target="_blank">approved a broadly bipartisan bill </a>to provide Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan with $96 billion in emergency spending. Much of that money would flow through the U.S. government, including for the departments of Defense and State.</p>
<p>House Republicans, however, are having a debate about the difference between providing military and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, Johnson said.</p>
<p>“Internally, I think there is a big distinction in the minds of a lot of people between lethal aid for Ukraine and the humanitarian component,” he said.</p>
<p>Johnson, who has been noncommittal publicly about whether the House would ever take up assistance to Ukraine, seemed to shift somewhat to supporting the idea of aid, even if he didn’t comment specifically on the substance.</p>
<p>“We understand the role that America plays in the world. We understand the importance of sending a strong signal to the world that we stand by our allies,” Johnson said. “And we cannot allow terrorists and tyrants to march through the globe.”</p>

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The Department of Veterans Affairs expanded access to in vitro fertilization on Monday, saying that eligible unmarried veterans and veterans in same-sex marriages can now access IVF at VA health care facilities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-expands-in-vitro-fertilization-for-veterans/" target="_blank">announcement</a> notes that federal law requires the VA only provide IVF treatments to veterans whose issues having children are due to a health condition from their military service.</p>
<p>“Raising a family is a wonderful thing, and I’m proud that VA will soon help more Veterans have that opportunity,” VA Secretary Denis McDonough said in a written statement. “This expansion of care has long been a priority for us, and we are working urgently to make sure that eligible unmarried Veterans, Veterans in same-sex marriages, and Veterans who need donors will have access to IVF in every part of the country as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The VA has only provided IVF care for married veterans who were able to use their own eggs or sperm during the process, but the new announcement allows veterans to use donor eggs, sperm and embryos.</p>
<p>The VA noted in its announcement the department doesn’t cover surrogacy costs.</p>
<p>The VA also reiterated it provides up to $2,000 in adoption expenses for veterans with a disability connected to their military service that caused infertility.</p>
<p><strong>Legislative options</strong></p>
<p>Washington state Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said in a written statement the VA’s decision to expand access to IVF “is an important step forward that will help more veterans start and grow their families.”</p>
<p>“I have fought for over a decade to expand fertility care and treatment to more veterans and servicemembers, and I’m thrilled that DoD, and now VA, are making progress toward expanding their IVF services with new policies will be life-changing for veterans and servicemembers who were for far too long excluded from care,” she said.</p>
<p>Murray plans to go to the Senate floor this week to ask for quick approval through unanimous consent of a bill to further broaden access to fertility treatments.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2801/text" target="_blank">bill</a>, titled the Veteran Families Health Services Act, would allow the VA to permanently expand which veterans have access to IVF as well as provide the option for military members to freeze their eggs or sperm before deployment to combat zones or hazardous duty assignments.</p>
<p>The legislation would expand adoption assistance for veterans and require both the VA and the Department of Defense to “facilitate research on the long-term reproductive health needs of veterans.”</p>
<p>The Senate bill has 24 co-sponsors, all of whom are Democrats or are independents who align politically with the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs ranking member Mark Takano and the Health Subcommittee ranking member Julia Brownley, both California Democrats, said in a joint statement the expansion “is a step in the right direction to allow eligible unmarried veterans and veterans in same-sex marriages to receive IVF, but we think current law is still too restrictive.”</p>
<p>“It is very difficult to prove that infertility has been caused by prior service to our country, and the onus is on the veteran to prove it,” the two wrote. “Most veterans with infertility have faced a difficult choice: pay the prohibitive cost of IVF out of pocket, or lose valuable treatment time pursuing a VA service connection.”</p>
<p>The two then pressed for Congress to approve a different bill that would expand IVF access for veterans, dubbed the Veterans Infertility Treatment Act.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/544/text?s=1&amp;r=25" target="_blank">bill</a> has 31 co-sponsors in the House, all of whom are Democrats.</p>
<p>Takano and Brownley said that their legislation is necessary to ensure “any veteran, regardless of whether their infertility is service-connected,” has access to IVF “as part of VA’s comprehensive medical benefits package.”</p>
<p>“Given what we recently saw in Alabama and the growing attacks on reproductive rights in our country, it is more clear than ever that we need to expand IVF access for veterans, regardless of where they live,” they wrote. “This new VA policy is an important step. We will continue to advocate for legislation that will ensure any veteran who wants to start a family can.”</p>

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House on a bipartisan vote passed a short-term funding extension Thursday intended to give lawmakers a bit more time to wrap up work on the annual spending bills — trying to dodge a shutdown despite election year politics and narrow margins.</p>
<p>The stopgap spending bill, sometimes called a continuing resolution, or CR, would keep funding mostly flat for programs funded in six of the full-year bills through March 8 and for programs in the other six bills through March 22. That means Congress will face another deadline just next week for action.</p>
<p>The House <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202458" target="_blank">voted 320-99</a> to approve the stopgap <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7463/text" target="_blank">bill</a>, which now goes to the Senate, where any one lawmaker can slow down the approval process, pushing it past the Friday midnight deadline.</p>
<p>A Senate failure to send the bill to President Joe Biden before then would result in a partial government shutdown for the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation and Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>Other agencies, like the Food and Drug Administration and military construction projects, would also be closed except for essential staff until a stopgap bill is enacted.</p>
<p>“While at the time of passing our last continuing resolution I had hoped we would not need this measure, we owe it to the American people to do our due diligence in reaching the end of this process,” the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, said on the House floor. “I appreciate the respectful bipartisan cooperation that took place to put forward this continuing resolution and move us closer to the finish line.”</p>
<p>GOP Rep. Chuck Fleischmann of Tennessee, an appropriator, acknowledged that many of his Republican colleagues would be upset with another CR, but he noted the slim majority in the GOP and that the bill gives Congress more time to pass the remaining appropriations bills.</p>
<p>“We are where we are,” he said. “This negotiation has been difficult, but to close the government down at a time like this would hurt people who should not be hurt.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Border security </h4>

	
<p>Republicans like Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona and Bob Good of Virginia expressed their frustration about border security, and said House Republicans have not leveraged the threat of shutting down the federal government to push for changes in immigration policy.</p>
<p>“We just keep spending money and we keep the policies that are in place,” Biggs said.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana said during a Thursday press conference that the bill texts for the first package of six spending bills will be released this weekend and members will be given at least 72 hours to read the bills before voting.</p>
<p>“This is a bipartisan agreement in the end, but it sticks to the numbers, the agreement on spending, it does not go above that,” Johnson said. “It will increase a bit, defense spending, but there will be real cuts to non-defense discretionary spending.”</p>
<p>Johnson added that after the remaining appropriations bills are done by the March 22 deadline, he wants to quickly move on to fiscal year 2025, as well as other issues, such as immigration.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Thursday morning the only way for Congress to accomplish anything during divided government is through bipartisanship.</p>
<p>“This agreement is proof that when the four leaders work together, when bipartisanship is prioritized, when getting things done for the American people takes a high priority, good things can happen, even in divided government,” Schumer said. “And I hope this sets the stage for Congress to finish the appropriations process in a bipartisan way very soon.”</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said he appreciated the “commitment to see this process through and make good on this essential governing responsibility.”</p>
<p>“As I said earlier this week, government shutdowns never produce positive outcomes. That’s why Congress is going to avoid one this week,” McConnell said. “Leaders in both parties and both houses have agreed to a plan that would keep the lights on while appropriators complete their work and put annual appropriations bills on a glide path to becoming law.”</p>
<p>Congress has used a series of these stopgap funding measures to extend its deadlines for passing the dozen annual appropriations bills after failing to meet an Oct. 1 deadline.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Deep disagreements</h4>

	
<p>House Republicans and Senate Democrats have had fundamental disagreements about spending levels and the policy that goes into the bills for months.</p>
<p>Those differences began after Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-budget-asks-25-tax-billionaires-boosts-domestic-and-defense-spending" target="_blank">submitted his budget request</a> for fiscal year 2024 in March 2023, starting off the annual process.</p>
<p>The disputes appeared to abate a bit after Biden and then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default" target="_blank">reached agreement on total spending levels</a> in May 2023 at the same time they brokered a bipartisan agreement to address the nation’s debt limit.</p>
<p>House GOP appropriators moved away from that agreement after McCarthy experienced pressure from especially conservative members to significantly cut spending on domestic programs below the agreement.</p>
<p>The original batch of House spending bills also included dozens of very conservative GOP policy initiatives, drawing rebukes from Democrats and impeding the path toward a final bipartisan agreement.</p>
<p>A faction of far-right House Republicans <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">ousting</a> McCarthy of California in early October and then spending weeks disagreeing about who should lead them also delayed the process.</p>
<p>Johnson, after becoming speaker, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/partial-government-shutdown-week-away-johnson-says-hell-stick-spending-deal" target="_blank">renegotiated the spending levels</a> for defense and domestic discretionary programs with Biden in January, starting off the process of merging the GOP bills from the House with the broadly bipartisan bills approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>The spending deal sets spending on defense programs at $886.3 billion and provides $772.7 billion for non-defense discretionary spending.</p>
<p>Congressional leaders and the four lawmakers that lead the Appropriations committees in both chambers <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-brokers-deal-government-spending-deadlines-trying-avoid-shutdown" target="_blank">announced Wednesday</a> they’d reached final agreement on six bills and had an agreement for another stopgap spending bill to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>Those bills, which will make up the first so-called “minibus,” include Agriculture-FDA, Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy-Water, Interior-Environment, Military Construction-VA and Transportation-HUD.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">March 22 deadline</h4>

	
<p>The remaining six bills, the toughest to negotiate, haven’t yet garnered bipartisan, bicameral agreement, but the statement said they “will be finalized, voted on, and enacted prior to March 22.”</p>
<p>That spending package is supposed to include the Defense, Financial Services and General Government, Homeland Security, Labor-HHS-Education, Legislative Branch and State-Foreign Operations government funding bills.</p>
<p>Should Congress approve all dozen of the bills before the March 22 final deadline, and Biden signs them, that would place lawmakers 174 days behind their deadline.</p>
<p>That would be the latest members have completed work on all the bills since fiscal 2017, when they wrapped up work 216 days into the fiscal year, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46595" target="_blank">according to the nonpartisan</a> Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>Congress wrapped up work on all the bills during fiscal 2018 by March 23, but that was 173 days behind their deadline. The difference between this fiscal year and then is due to leap day.</p>
<p>The process of funding the government is expected to start anew on March 11 when Biden submits his budget request for fiscal 2025.</p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden huddled with top congressional leaders at the White House on Tuesday amid a crunch over government funding as well as a familiar stalemate over assistance to two major allies — and no solution immediately in sight.</p>
<p>Lawmakers leaving the meeting, which lasted about an hour, said it was worthwhile, even though it didn’t lead to any agreements that would avoid a partial government shutdown from beginning this weekend or clear a Senate-passed package of aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.</p>
<p>“It was a productive meeting on the government shutdown, we are making good progress … (and) the speaker said unequivocally he wants to avoid a government shutdown,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said following the meeting, referring to House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican.</p>
<p>Johnson faces tensions and demands in the House. Congressional leaders and the Biden administration have agreed to total spending levels for each of the dozen annual appropriations bills, but far-right conservative lawmakers are pressuring Johnson to include policy riders that Democrats have said are unacceptable.</p>
<p>Schumer said it’s likely Congress will need to approve another continuing resolution, or CR, to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p>
<p>Those stopgap spending bills continue the prior fiscal year’s funding levels and policy until Congress reaches agreement on full-year spending bills.</p>
<p>Johnson, who has remained noncommittal on putting assistance to Ukraine on the House floor for a vote, said House Republicans are still “pursuing and investigating all the various options on that.”</p>
<p>“We will address that in a timely manner,” Johnson said at the White House of the global supplemental package.</p>
<p>“The first priority of the country is our border and making sure it’s secure,” Johnson said, adding that he’s “optimistic” the House can prevent a partial shutdown.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said after returning to the Capitol that the meeting went well.</p>
<p>“Well, mainly we talked about keeping the government open, which I think we all agree on,” McConnell said. “And I think we’re making some real headway on the appropriations process.”</p>
<p>Time is short and the House does not return from recess until Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Congress has until Friday at midnight to either pass the Agriculture-FDA, Energy-Water, Military Construction-VA and Transportation-HUD spending bills, or to pass a stopgap spending bill for the federal agencies funded within those four bills.</p>
<p>Congress has until March 8 to pass the other eight remaining appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began back on Oct. 1; otherwise those departments and agencies would begin a shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Hope springs eternal’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>McConnell said during a press conference Tuesday afternoon he believes Congress could pass the four bills due Friday without using a stopgap spending bill to extend that deadline.</p>
<p>“I think we’re getting close on the first four bills; hopefully that won’t require another short-term CR,” McConnell said. “And hope springs eternal.”</p>
<p>Schumer, speaking at a separate press conference inside the Capitol on Tuesday afternoon, said negotiators on the full-year government spending bills are “greatly narrowing the ground of where the disputes are.”</p>
<p>“A key here is making sure that the government doesn’t shut down, which means extending government funding after the deadlines if we can’t reach agreement,” Schumer said.</p>
<p>A White House statement on the meeting said Biden “emphasized that the only path forward is through bipartisan funding bills that deliver for the American people and are free of any extreme policies.”</p>
<p>“The President also emphasized the urgent need for Congress to continue standing with Ukraine as it defends itself every day against Russia’s brutal invasion,” the White House statement said. “He discussed how Ukraine has lost ground on the battlefield in recent weeks and is being forced to ration ammunition and supplies due to Congressional inaction.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Global aid stalled</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Senate <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00048.htm" target="_blank">voted</a> 70-29 in mid-February <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-sends-house-95-billion-aid-package-ukraine-israel-taiwan" target="_blank">to approve a $95 billion emergency spending bill </a>that would provide military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.</p>
<p>The vote came after months on hold as Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Lankford, Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy and Arizona independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/details-proposed-major-overhaul-us-immigration-law-global-aid-package-unveiled" target="_blank">negotiated a bipartisan bill </a>to address border security and immigration policy at the insistence of GOP leaders.</p>
<p>Republican senators ultimately <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-kills-immigration-overhaul-hits-stalemate-israel-ukraine-aid" target="_blank">blocked that compromise agreement from moving forward</a>, saying it didn’t go far enough. Johnson’s opposition to the agreement was one of the factors that toppled the bipartisan compromise.</p>
<p>Johnson has been skeptical about passing the Senate-approved assistance package ever since, saying it should include measures to address border security and U.S. immigration.</p>
<p>Johnson said Tuesday following the White House meeting that he met one-on-one with the president and pushed for the southern border to be addressed.</p>
<p>“They understand the catastrophe at the border is affecting everyone and it is top of mind for all the American people,” he said.</p>
<p>Schumer said the discussion about assistance to Ukraine was “the most intense I’ve ever encountered in my many meetings in the Oval Office,” because of the “urgency of supporting Ukraine and the consequences to the people of America, to America’s strength if we don’t do anything.”</p>
<p>Schumer said that while Johnson said he wants policy changes at the southern border, “we made it clear to him, we can’t tarry for the war could be lost” in Ukraine.</p>
<p>McConnell said during the afternoon press conference that he hopes the House will take up the Senate-approved Ukraine bill and pass it without making change, since if they were to amend the legislation, it would have to go back to the Senate, slowing down the process.</p>
<p>“Not only do we not want to shut the government down, we don’t want the Russians to win in Ukraine,” McConnell said. “And so we have a time problem here. And the best way to move quickly and get the bill to the president would be for the House to take up the Senate bill and pass it.”</p>

A Massachusetts appeals court temporarily blocked a Texas-based federal judge’s ruling that suspended the FDA’s approval of the abortion drug Mifepristone, which is part of a two-drug regimen to induce an abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy in combination with the drug Misoprostol. (Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on March 26 in the case that could significantly curtail access to a prescription drug used for both abortions and miscarriage care.</p>
<p>The case centers on when and how patients can access mifepristone, a pharmaceutical the U.S. Food and Drug Administration originally approved in 2000.</p>
<p>Mifepristone is currently approved for use up to 10 weeks gestation and accounts for more than half of abortions in the United States when used in combination with a second pharmaceutical called misoprostol.</p>
<p>Doctors also often use the two-drug regimen to provide treatment following a miscarriage.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lawsuit history</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The original lawsuit, brought by the anti-abortion legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom, asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas to overturn the FDA’s original approval of mifepristone.</p>
<p>If the judge didn’t agree to that, the organization requested the court revert prescribing and dosage of mifepristone to what was in place before the FDA began implementing changes in 2016.</p>

<p>Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk <a href="https://newsfromthestates.com/article/us-justice-department-ask-supreme-court-reject-limits-access-abortion-pill-1" target="_blank">stayed the FDA’s original approval of mifepristone</a> in an April 2023 ruling that was later put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court pending appeal.</p>
<p>The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals heard <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-panel-us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">oral arguments</a> in May 2023 before <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-pill-stay-market-until-us-supreme-court-ruling-after-appeals-court-order-0" target="_blank">issuing its ruling</a> a few months later, in August.</p>
<p>That three-judge panel said that mifepristone could remain legal in the United States, but that prescribing and dosage guidelines should go back to what was used before changes began taking effect in 2016. That ruling is on hold pending the Supreme Court’s decision in this case.</p>
<p>That ruling, should it ever take effect, would lower the maximum gestational age from 10 weeks to seven weeks and remove the option for mifepristone to be prescribed via telehealth appointments and mailed to patients’ homes.</p>
<p>Patients would once again be required to attend three in-person doctor’s office visits to complete a medication abortion.</p>
<p>Only doctors would be able to prescribe mifepristone, instead of health care providers who are authorized to prescribe medications.</p>
<p>Dosage and timing of mifepristone and the second drug used in medication abortion, misoprostol, would need to be administered under guidelines that went out of use more than seven years ago.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Briefs filed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Dozens of medical organizations and pharmaceutical groups have filed briefs with the Supreme Court, urging it to decide one way or another.</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America wrote in its <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-235/284838/20231012134701542_PhRMA%20Amicus%20Br.%20ISO%20Petitioners.pdf" target="_blank">28-page brief </a>that if the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling is left in place, it “could invite boundless litigation to FDA drug approvals.”</p>
<p>“Congress created an FDA approval process that is both rigorous and thorough, and pharmaceutical companies invest billions of dollars in research and development to meet FDA’s scientific standards,” they wrote.</p>
<p>If the appeals court’s ruling is allowed to take effect, they wrote, it “threatens to stifle pharmaceutical innovation by disrupting industry’s reasonable investment-backed expectations.”</p>
<p>Several medical organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, wrote in a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-235/284910/20231012165311306_Amicus%20Brief%20of%20American%20College%20of%20Obstetricians%20and%20Gynecologists%20et%20al..pdf" target="_blank">36-page brief </a>to the Supreme Court that “no patient should be denied treatment for miscarriage or other early pregnancy loss because of Respondents’ hypothetical fears or personal beliefs.”</p>
<p>When it comes to abortion access, they wrote that patients “in states where abortion remains legal and protected should not be denied the ability to safely and privately seek to exercise that right through safe and effective medication abortion.”</p>
<p>“Restricting access to mifepristone — the safety of which is proven by decades of rigorous scientific study and millions of uses — in ways that are not medically necessary or scientifically sound would seriously increase risk for hundreds of thousands of patients, while protecting none,” they wrote.</p>
<p>“For already vulnerable populations (particularly those living in areas with limited access to OB/GYN care) the rollback approved by the Fifth Circuit promises to be especially devastating and to further perpetuate racial and socioeconomic inequalities,” they added.</p>
<p>Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Erin Hawley said in a written statement released last week that she urged “the Supreme Court to hold the FDA accountable and require the agency to reinstate its safety standards.”</p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Congress will have until early March to finish work it was supposed to complete last fall — and will avert a partial government shutdown — under a bill both chambers approved with broad bipartisan support Thursday.</p>
<p>The 77-18 <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00012.htm" target="_blank">vote</a> in the Senate and 314-108 vote in the House sent the bill to President Joe Biden, and he is expected to sign it before a Friday midnight deadline.</p>
<p>The short-term government funding bill will keep federal departments and agencies running under the spending levels and policies last approved during unified Democratic control of Washington.</p>
<p>The stopgap measure, often called a continuing resolution, or CR, is meant to give the Republican House and Democratic Senate more time to broker agreement on the dozen full-year appropriations bills that were supposed to become law by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Senate Appropriations Chair Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said she hoped this would be the last continuing resolution Congress uses during the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>“Passing this measure will allow us the time we need to hammer out those funding bills for fiscal year ‘24 after many months of needless delays,” Murray said.</p>
<p>“I think we all want this to be a drama-free and reliable process, so I hope House Republicans will work with us to make that possible now too, which means leaving extreme partisan demands at the door,” she added.</p>
<p>House Appropriations Chair Kay Granger appeared to reject that sentiment during debate on the continuing resolution in that chamber.</p>
<p>The Texas Republican noted that “finding common ground will not be easy” since the GOP plans to press to include their conservative policy riders in the dozen full-year spending bills.</p>
<p>“I want to be clear, as we begin to conference these bills, House Republicans are committed to fighting for meaningful policy changes,” Granger said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Agreed-upon spending levels</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Appropriators in the House and Senate will negotiate those dozen bills under spending levels agreed to earlier this month when Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, reached agreement to spend $886.3 billion on defense and $772.7 billion for domestic accounts.</p>
<p>But the chairs and ranking members in the House and Senate tasked with working out bicameral agreement on the dozen full-year government funding bills need more time to agree how much should be spent on each.</p>
<p>They’ll also need to decide what to do about spending policy amid the thorny disagreements.</p>
<p>So Congress drafted its third CR of the fiscal year with a new deadline of March 1 to approve the Agriculture-FDA, Energy-Water, Military Construction-VA and Transportation-HUD spending bills.</p>
<p>The other eight bills will need to become law by March 8 under the CR.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Rand Paul, Roger Marshall amendments rejected</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Two Republican senators attempted to change the continuing resolution before it went to the House, though they were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The Senate <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00010.htm" target="_blank">voted 44-50 </a> to reject an amendment from Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul that would have barred “any direct United States assistance, loan guarantee, or debt relief to the Palestinian Authority or any other Palestinian governing entity in the West Bank and Gaza.”</p>
<p>The provision included several carveouts that would allow aid to continue if the Palestinian Authority or another Palestinian governing body in the West Bank or Gaza were to take seven steps, including if it “formally recognized the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state” and removed “all individuals with terrorist ties from security services.”</p>
<p>“All American aid should be conditioned on recipients’ practice of protecting basic human rights,” Paul said.</p>
<p>Maryland Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin spoke against the amendment, saying Paul’s proposal would have compromised the United States’ ability to “work to make sure there’s a future for the Palestinian people living in peace with Israel.”</p>
<p>“Our ally Israel is at war to destroy Hamas terrorists, not in a war against the Palestinian people,” Cardin said.</p>
<p>Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall was unsuccessful in getting his colleagues to go along with a so-called motion to commit, which would have sent the bill to the Appropriations Committee and required that panel to rewrite it to last through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00011.htm" target="_blank">That vote was 13-82. </a></p>
<p>“A full-year CR through September 30, would result in a spending cut of $73 billion, bringing our total discretionary spending down to $1.56 trillion; a significant cut from the $1.66 trillion funding deal that’s in the works currently,” Marshall said. “This is the fiscally responsible decision that the American people deserve and Congress has an obligation to make.”</p>
<p>Murray and Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, both rejected the idea, saying it would undo all the work their committee has done on the annual government spending bills.</p>
<p>“Adopting this motion would wipe out the work of the Appropriations Committee that led to 12 standalone bills being reported last summer with overwhelming bipartisan support,” Collins said. “It would also lock in dangerously inadequate funding levels for our national security and lead to cuts in other vital programs serving our veterans, older Americans and low income families.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Congress has much more work to do’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During House floor debate, Granger urged her fellow GOP lawmakers to vote for the continuing resolution.</p>
<p>“While we have made progress in our efforts to finish fiscal year 2024 bills, Congress has much more work to do, and more time is needed to negotiate bills on both sides,” Granger said.</p>
<p>Connecticut Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, also backed the stopgap spending bill but said she hopes it will be the last one and that Congress will next be voting on the overdue full-year bills.</p>
<p>“I hope the current pace and tone will result in swiftly finalizing all 2024 funding bills in a bipartisan fashion,” DeLauro said.</p>
<p>House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, a Virginia Republican, rebuked members of his own party for not pressing for a partial government shutdown in order to get policy wins.</p>
<p>“We’re going to pass another major piece of legislation predominantly with Democrat votes, minority votes, when we have the House majority,” Good said. “This is a loser for the American people. It’s a loser for the country.”</p>
<p>Republicans, Good said, should have used the Friday funding deadline and chances of a partial government shutdown to press for their preferred border and immigration policy.</p>
<p>“We could have utilized that momentum to attach border security to this continuing resolution and dare the Senate to vote against it and dare the Senate to vote against funding the government and securing the border,” Good said. “And we failed to do even that.”</p>

<p>The move, while not final, would give the Republican House, Democratic Senate and Biden administration a few more weeks to reach a bipartisan compromise on the dozen annual appropriations bills.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a group of 13 House Republicans blocked that chamber from debating unrelated legislation Wednesday as a way of signaling their frustration with a bipartisan spending agreement forged by their leadership during the holiday break.</p>
<p>Montana Republican Rep. Matt Rosendale said shortly afterward during a press conference that group of GOP lawmakers will continue taking “whatever action we can with the tools that are available to us to let the administration know that they are not going to get additional funding for their priorities until we see a secure border.”</p>
<p>Rosendale and a few others called for shutting down the government in order to get the changes they want on immigration and border policy enacted.</p>
<p>While the group could potentially slow down approval of a short-term spending patch or eventually the full-year spending bills, they don’t appear to have the votes to block passage in either chamber.</p>
<p>On the question of a stopgap spending bill, often called a continuing resolution or CR, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said Tuesday that it was obvious lawmakers would need that extension.</p>
<p>McConnell said the length of that would be up to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican.</p>
<p>“We need to prevent a government shutdown and so the obvious question is how long does the CR need to be, and that will be up to the majority leader and the speaker to determine the length of the CR,” McConnell said. “The simplest things take a week in the Senate, so I think frequently the House doesn’t understand how long it takes to get something through the Senate.”</p>
<p>Schumer and Johnson weren’t ready to say that Congress needs another continuing resolution on Wednesday, though neither ruled it out.</p>
<p>“The pedal is to the metal right now and I’m very hopeful and optimistic that we can meet the deadlines,” Johnson said during a press conference.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Two deadlines ahead</h4>

	
<p>Schumer said Wednesday during a floor speech that he and Johnson agree there shouldn’t be a partial government shutdown. But on Tuesday at a press conference, he declined to say whether he thinks another continuing resolution would be needed.</p>
<p>“You know, the appropriators and their staffs are really good. We have real consensus among the four corners that they want to get something done,” Schumer said. “We are going to fight as hard as we can to get this done as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Schumer said Wednesday afternoon that he would “make an assessment tomorrow as to what to do.”</p>
<p>Four of the full-year spending bills must pass before Jan. 19, otherwise the federal departments and agencies funded by the Agriculture, Energy-Water, Military Construction-VA and Transportation-HUD spending bills would begin a shutdown.</p>
<p>The departments and agencies in the other eight bills are funded under the last CR through Feb. 2. If Congress doesn’t pass another short-term bill or complete work on those full-year bills before that deadline, those departments would begin their shutdowns.</p>
<p>Democrats and Republicans hashed out an agreement for $886.3 billion in defense and $772.7 billion in domestic discretionary spending for the fiscal year that began back on Oct. 1 over the weekend. But Congress has several steps to go before those bills can become law.</p>
<p>The first is for the House and Senate to agree how to divvy up those so-called topline numbers to each of the 12 bills. They’ll then need to merge the House and Senate bills into final legislation that can pass both chambers.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘A real challenge’</h4>

	
<p>Senate Appropriations Chair Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said Tuesday there’s no timeline for reaching agreement on those individual funding levels, but said she hopes to get that done as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Murray didn’t rule out the idea of using another short-term stopgap spending bill to avoid a shutdown while Congress tries to complete work on the full-year bills.</p>
<p>“Right now we’re trying to get our allocations and begin work on our bills,” she said. “It’s going to be a real challenge.”</p>
<p>West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, the top Republican on the Labor-HHS-Education funding panel, said that Murray and the House chairwoman are working out spending levels for the bills, but said she didn’t know when those would be finalized.</p>
<p>Capito said if lawmakers move quickly, they could avoid another continuing resolution covering the four spending bills that are due on Jan. 19.</p>
<p>“I think we can finish the ones by next Friday. And that’s my preferred route. That’s what we should be doing,” Capito said. “So I could support a short-term CR, but I’d prefer not to.”</p>
<p>Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, the top Republican on the Commerce-Justice-Science Subcommittee, said he has been instructed to clear “the underbrush, so to speak,” referring to small disputes within the bills.</p>
<p>“We’re doing, what are the modest kinds of things that need to be resolved,” Moran explained. “So, trying to be in a position to be ready to move when we’re able to do so.”</p>
<p>Moran said the Senate could accomplish its work, but noted he’s concerned the House won’t be able to pass full-year spending bills.</p>
<p>“If across the line is the Senate, I think that’s accomplishable,” Moran said. “If across the line includes the House, I still have great concerns about their reaction and capability of advancing appropriation bills.”</p>
<p>Arkansas Republican Sen. John Boozman, ranking member on the Military Construction-VA spending panel, said while getting final-year bills enacted will be challenging, there is a path forward.</p>
<p>“The appropriators generally know each other fairly well, the staffs, so they’ve been informally talking for a long time about this,” he said. “They’re continuing and I think they’re getting a little bit more serious.”</p>
<p>But Boozman said lawmakers will need more time to reach agreement than they have under the current stopgap spending law, which covers some of the bills until Jan. 19 and some until Feb. 2.</p>
<p>“I think it’s going to be really difficult to get them done in that short of a time frame,” he said. “So I would say probably, March is a fair statement.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Practical, workable solution’</h4>

	
<p>Arkansas Republican Rep. Steve Womack, chairman of the Financial Services spending panel, said Wednesday “a short-term CR seems to be about the only practical, workable solution, short of shutting this government down.”</p>
<p>Moving the deadline back to March through that continuing resolution would be a good option, he said.</p>
<p>Once Congress has more time to work out agreement on the full-year spending bills, House Republicans will face hurdles to compromising with the Senate on policy language. House GOP leaders will also have to sort out the differing opinions within the party on when and how the federal government should spend money, Womack said.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of division within the conference,” he said. “It may be a brand new year, but it’s kind of the same old song and dance. So whatever we do, it’s obvious to me, we’re going to have to have some kind of a bipartisan solution because we’re just not going to be able to move it on our own.”</p>
<p>Florida Republican Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, chairman of the State-Foreign Operations spending panel, said it’s “highly unlikely” that the four bills due by Jan. 19 can become law on time, though he added it’s “premature” to talk about the length or details of another continuing resolution.</p>
<p>Díaz-Balart rejected calls from some of his fellow Republicans like Rosendale to tie changes to immigration and border policy to the annual government funding bills.</p>
<p>He said those efforts should remain linked to the supplemental spending bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. That spending package is currently separate from the annual appropriations process.</p>
<p>“We’ve always talked about linking the supplemental to border security,” Díaz-Balart said. “And now all of a sudden, I think in an effort to just criticize the speaker, you’re trying to link something that none of us ever talked about linking to border security.”</p>
<p>Oklahoma Republican Tom Cole, chairman of the Transportation-HUD subcommittee, said he “understands the frustration behind” calls to shut down the government, but said it’s a “stupid idea” that won’t lead to any victories for the GOP.</p>
<p>“If somebody can show me once where it worked — where somebody shut down the government and then produce the political result that they said they were going to achieve by shutting it down — then, I’ll rethink my position,” Cole said. “But in my experience, it just simply never works.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Johnson faces potential revolt</h4>

	
<p>Any agreement on the dozen full-year government funding bills could lead some House Republicans to revolt against Speaker Johnson, using the same procedural tool that allows any one lawmaker to call for a vote on the motion to vacate.</p>
<p>Some more conservative House GOP lawmakers have publicly rebuked Johnson for agreeing to the spending levels in the bipartisan deal announced over the weekend.</p>
<p>Johnson said Wednesday that he’s “not concerned” about being removed from the speaker’s office, though he, like former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, will have little control over that.</p>
<p>“Leadership is tough,” Johnson said. “You take a lot of criticism. But remember, I am a hardline conservative. That’s what they used to call me. I come from that camp.”</p>
<p>Johnson said he agreed with those GOP lawmakers frustrated with the spending deal that Congress needs to cut federal spending, though he also pointed out to them that Republicans have an especially thin majority in the House and don’t control the Senate or the White House.</p>
<p>“We have very difficult challenges, but we’re going to advance the ball,” Johnson said. “We’re going to advance our conservative principles, and we are going to demonstrate that we can govern well. And I’m going to keep trudging forward.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Rosendale, while unhappy with the bipartisan spending deal, rebuffed calls to oust Johnson.</p>
<p>“I would not say that with this group, our intention is to threaten Speaker Johnson with his job,” he said. “What we are saying is that we’re going to do everything within our power, with the tools that the House of Representatives has… to make sure that we do not continue funding aspects of government until we have a secure border.”</p>
<p>Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett said during that press conference that Congress holds “this country’s purse strings and we ought to get some guts in exercising them.”</p>
<p>Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Good, chairman of the far-right Freedom Caucus, said during that press conference that he and like-minded “colleagues are prepared to do what’s necessary to make a difference.”</p>
<p>“The American people elected us to cut our spending, to restore fiscal stability to this Congress, to save the country and to secure the border,” Good said. “And we’re willing to do whatever it takes.”</p>

(Photo by Bill Dickinson/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The union representing U.S. Capitol Police is warning that the federal law enforcement agency doesn’t have enough manpower to address threats to members of Congress and is criticizing the Architect of the Capitol for not implementing some of the changes proposed following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack.</p>
<p>“We’ve never seen a threat environment like this,” union Chairman Gus Papathanasiou said in a written statement. “Given the profound divisions in this country and this year’s elections, people ask me if I’m concerned and I tell them I am worried — very worried.”</p>
<p>“There may be another contested election and we still haven’t addressed the manpower and security vulnerabilities that have been identified,” he added.</p>
<p>The two most significant issues facing Capitol security are that USCP leaders aren’t close to hiring all the officers they are authorized to and the “failure” of the Architect of the Capitol to implement certain changes to the buildings and surrounding campus, he wrote.</p>
<p>As the number of threats against lawmakers and their staff continues to increase each year, Papathanasiou said the USCP needs to hire more people to account for the number of officers who have left or are eligible for retirement.</p>
<p>“Putting aside the need to increase hiring, we urgently need to address the pending loss of officers who are due for retirement — over 500 officers are eligible to retire at any time,” Papathanasiou said.</p>
<p>“Many of the younger officers who were hired post-January 6th have resigned due to the conditions and hours we’re asked to work,” he said. “We lack the manpower to fill mission requirements, so officers are forced to work enormous amounts of overtime.”</p>
<p>As a result, USCP officers often work six days a week and double shifts, he said.</p>
<p>A USCP spokesperson said in a written statement that the agency has “more sworn employees than at any other point in this Department’s history — not to mention all of the new civilian positions to better support them.”</p>
<p>“Still, we agree that we all have to continue that progress as our mission to protect the Members of Congress during a heightened threat environment continues to expand,” the USCP spokesperson said. “Luckily, our recruiting team is working around the clock to bring us nearly 1,000 officer applications a month. The toughest task for us is to find the right women and men out of those applicants to join our growing Department.”</p>
<p>The USCP is authorized to hire 2,126 officers and currently has more than 2,000, according to the spokesperson. The department had about 1,800 on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Police funding</h4>

	
<p>Congress is currently debating how much funding to allocate for USCP as part of the annual government funding process that was supposed to wrap up Oct. 1.</p>
<p>House Republicans’ bill proposed $780.9 million for USCP during the current fiscal year, a $46.3 million increase compared to current funding levels. That total includes $588.1 million for salaries and benefits, a boost of $46.3 million.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/crpt/hrpt120/CRPT-118hrpt120.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> that accompanied the House bill noted “that, while the Department has aggressively sought qualified civilian applicants, it has had difficulty finding candidates that meet the Department’s rigorous standards.”</p>
<p>“The Department’s projections for fiscal year 2023 civilian hiring are below the authorized and appropriated levels and the Committee believes it will be difficult to hire the requested civilians for fiscal year 2024,” the House report states. “While the authorized number of civilians is supported, the Committee’s recommendation includes a reduction to the account due to historical under execution for civilian personnel.”</p>
<p>The Senate spending bill, which garnered bipartisan support, proposed $792 million for USCP, nearly $58 million more than its current budget. Almost $589 million would go toward salaries, benefits and overtime.</p>
<p>The Senate panel’s report said that lawmakers recognized “the expanding mission requirements for the United States Capitol Police in the area of Member protection.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/fy24_legislative_branch_report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> also calls on USCP to submit a report “that outlines the on-board strength of the USCP broken down by officials, officers, sworn recruits and civilians” as well as a  “multi-year strategy to remediate staffing shortages and incentivize sworn hiring and retention in future fiscal years.”</p>
<p>“The Committee expects this report to be thorough and timely from the Department,” the report says. “The USCP shall provide quarterly updates to the Committee thereafter on its staffing efforts.”</p>
<p>The House and Senate are supposed to pass a final version of that Legislative Branch funding bill before the Feb. 2 deadline.</p>
<p>The Architect of the Capitol didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>

Candidates winning a seat in the House spent on average about $840,000 in 2000, but that price tag has steadily increased ever since, reaching $1.4 million in 2010 and $2.8 million in 2022. (Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — The 2024 battle for control of Congress is underway in the states, accompanying the accelerating race for the presidency.</p>
<p>Republicans are preparing to funnel money and staff into a select few Senate races in an effort to flip that chamber back to their control, while Democrats are looking toward the districts President Joe Biden won as their pathway back to the majority in the House.</p>
<p>The campaigns are expected to be especially close, with the state and national parties spending millions of dollars, all against the backdrop of the presidential campaigns.</p>
<p>It’s possible that the House and Senate will continue to be split between the parties, but political observers see the prospect of a big switch. If current trends continue through the year, the Senate could well swing from Democratic to Republican control, and the House could flip from the GOP to Democrats.</p>
<p>The margins are tight. House Democrats only need a gain of five seats to regain power and Senate Republicans only need two, come November.</p>
<p>The 2024 Senate map is favorable for Republicans, who are defending 11 seats compared to 23 for Democrats. The GOP has a decent chance of picking up its two needed seats in states that have voted more conservatively in recent years, such as <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/06/23/u-s-sen-sherrod-browns-gop-challengers-familiar-faces-offering-new-messages/" target="_blank">Ohio</a> and <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/02/22/u-s-sen-jon-tester-announces-he-will-seek-re-election-in-2024/" target="_blank">Montana</a>. The two Democratic incumbents there — Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester — will also be campaigning in states that former President Donald Trump easily won in 2016 and 2020.</p>
<p>In the House, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-republicans-back-formal-impeachment-inquiry-against-biden" target="_blank">GOP leaders have launched an impeachment inquiry</a> into Biden that could risk reelection chances for the 18 Republicans who represent swing districts carried by Biden.</p>
<p>Republicans are also going up against new redistricting maps in the South. Democrats are favored to pick up three seats there — Alabama, Florida and Louisiana — and potentially gain anywhere from two to six GOP-held seats in New York.</p>
<p>House Republicans have struggled all year to govern with their slim majority, and to unify behind a Republican speaker of the House. It took Kevin McCarthy 15 rounds of votes to win the gavel last January. Then, 10 months later, eight Republicans and Democrats voted to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">remove him from the position. </a></p>
<p>That move was not only followed by three weeks of infighting, but any legislative work — including advancing government funding by a quickly approaching deadline — was halted. House Republicans <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/mike-johnson-louisiana-picked-newest-gop-nominee-us-house-speaker-8" target="_blank">finally </a>tapped Rep. Mike Johnson from Louisiana as their speaker.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House GOP fate seen tied to presidential race</h4>

	
<p>Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales notes in his latest <a href="https://www.insideelections.com/news/article/new-year-new-house-ratings" target="_blank">ratings</a> that “Republicans still have a narrow advantage to maintain their majority, but the presidential race hovers over the entire fight for the House.”</p>
<p>“If the race for the White House is competitive, then the fight for the House should be a close, district-by-district battle,” Gonzales said. “But if the presidential race turns into a lopsided affair, then the presidential winner will likely bring the House majority with them.”</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/new-york-republican-george-santos-expelled-us-house-bipartisan-vote" target="_blank">a recent expulsion</a> of GOP freshman George Santos, who was plagued by scandal, and McCarthy’s early retirement, the balance of power for House Republicans is now 220-213. That means Johnson can only afford to lose three GOP members on party-line votes.</p>
<p>The first year of the 118th Congress also <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-was-full-postponements-2023-now-2024-could-be-even-less-productive-0" target="_blank">didn’t involve much governing</a> to tout on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>So far, only 34 bills and resolutions have become law out of 724 votes this year. In 2022, for comparison, 549 votes were held and 248 bills and resolutions became law, according to the Clerk of the House.</p>
<p>The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank">rates</a> 24 House races as “toss ups,” with 14 of those seats held by Republicans and 10 by Democrats.</p>
<p>Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the UVA Center for Politics <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/a-republican-senate-in-a-divided-government/" target="_blank">projected</a> in late December that in the House, “court rulings in key redistricting cases, coupled with the political fallout from the Republicans’ internal chaos, gives Democrats a fighting chance to recapture the lower chamber.”</p>
<p>The report, from Thomas F. Schaller, noted that “one has to go back to the late 1800s to find an instance of divided government taking the form of a Republican Senate and a Democratic president and House.”</p>
<p>“Since 1968, all five of the other six possible permutations of divided government have occurred <em>except</em> Republicans controlling just the Senate,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Another challenge for House Republicans is that Johnson for the first time is tasked with raising millions of dollars for the party. Last year, McCarthy raised about $24 million for the GOP’s political action committee, according to Open Secrets.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Redrawn districts</h4>

	
<p>The majority could be made with a handful of races. Several federal court orders require the redrawing of congressional districts that will boost Democrats’ chances of flipping seats.</p>
<p>However, that’s not the case for North Carolina. The delegation is split between seven Republicans and seven Democrats, but the GOP-controlled state legislature adopted a map that greatly favors Republicans.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2023/12/19/voting-rights-groups-file-sweeping-lawsuit-against-nc-redistricting-plans/" target="_blank">the new North Carolina map</a>, it’s expected that Republicans are favored for 10 seats and Democrats three. One seat held by a Democrat is rated as a “toss up,” according to The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.</p>
<p>Several Democrats — Reps. Jeff Jackson, Wiley Nickel and Kathy Manning — have announced they would not seek reelection, arguing that they were gerrymandered out of their seats.</p>
<p>However, a coalition of voting rights groups and several Black voters filed a lawsuit against that new map. The suit, <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/black-and-latino-voters-sue-over-new-north-carolina-congressional-districts/" target="_blank">following another earlier</a>, argues that the new map violates federal law under the Voting Rights Act by racially gerrymandering seats in the state legislature and congressional districts.</p>
<p>But the new map that favors Republicans in North Carolina could be offset by the New York map.</p>
<p>A recent ruling from New York’s highest court has Democrats eyeing two to six current GOP swing districts that Biden won, making the state a battleground for the 2024 elections. The current New York delegation is made up of 15 Democrats and 11 Republicans.</p>
<p>A new congressional seat in Alabama is <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank">rated</a> as “likely Democrat,” according to The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/12/15/5th-circuit-denies-louisianas-appeal-in-congressional-redistricting-case/" target="_blank">Louisiana </a>was ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court to draw a second majority-Black district before the 2024 elections that will likely favor Democrats. Republicans currently hold five of the six congressional seats in Louisiana.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will it be a GOP Senate?</h4>

	
<p>Republicans are on track to regain control of the Senate, though Democrats in red states hope to hold them off against the odds.</p>
<p>The West Virginia Senate seat currently held by Joe Manchin III is highly expected to shift to GOP control <a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2023/11/09/manchin-will-not-seek-reelection-to-u-s-senate-in-2024-will-hit-to-road-to-unite-the-middle/" target="_blank">after the centrist Democrat retires. </a></p>
<p>Republican Gov. Jim Justice and Rep. Alex Mooney are among the leading candidates in the Republican primary, scheduled for May 14.</p>
<p>In Montana, the Republican primary on June 4 will determine who faces Tester in the general election. And Ohio voters will choose on March 19 which GOP Senate candidate moves onto the November ballot.</p>
<p>Arizona is another pickup opportunity for Republicans.</p>
<p>Sen. Kyrsten Sinema narrowly won as a Democrat six years ago, but she’s since switched her affiliation to independent. And she hasn’t yet said if she’ll run for reelection, leaving Democrats unclear about whether she could pull votes away from their official nominee. The primary is set for Aug. 6.</p>
<p>The Arizona, Montana and Ohio Senate races are all <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank">rated</a> as “toss ups” by The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.</p>
<p>Another four races for seats currently held by Democrats are rated as “lean Democrat,” meaning those campaigns are considered “competitive,” though “one party has an advantage.”</p>
<p>The 11 Senate seats that Republicans will defend in November are rated as either likely or solid Republican, meaning they aren’t considered “competitive.”</p>
<p>Democrats currently hold 48 seats in the Senate, though two other independents, Maine’s Angus King and Vermont’s Bernie Sanders, are reliable blue votes, as is Sinema. That effectively gives Democrats a 51-seat majority.</p>
<p>Republicans hold the other 49 seats, meaning they’ll need at least two pickups to regain control of the floor and committees.</p>
<p>While Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, would very much like to become majority leader once again, there’s always the possibility of another 50-50 split.</p>
<p>That would leave Senate control up to the presidential election, since Democrats held the majority during the first two years of the Biden administration thanks to the power given to Vice President Kamala Harris under the Constitution to break tie votes.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Money, money, money</h4>

	
<p>As is the case with nearly all modern elections, results will come down to turnout and fundraising.</p>
<p>Following the money has become somewhat complicated, given all candidates have their personal campaign accounts, many have political action committees, or PACs, and the political parties have their own central fundraising committees.</p>
<p>That alphabet soup includes the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and National Republican Senatorial Committee in the Senate. In the House, it’s the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee.</p>
<p>Open Secrets, the nonpartisan nonprofit organization that closely tracks campaign spending, reports the amount of money spent to win election to the House and the Senate has risen considerably.</p>
<p>Candidates winning a seat in the House spent on average about $840,000 in 2000, but that price tag has steadily increased ever since, reaching $1.4 million in 2010 and $2.8 million in 2022.</p>
<p>Politicians hoping to become a U.S. senator have experienced a similar trend, though the cost of winning is significantly higher for the upper chamber.</p>
<p>Senators spent about $7.3 million on average to win election in 2000, before that figure rose to $9.8 million in 2010 and $26.5 million during the 2022 elections.</p>
<p>Campaign spending can go much higher than that average, especially when Republicns and Democrats zero in on a few races in attempts to flip a chamber to their party’s control.</p>
<p>Senate candidates in Georgia spent $255 million during the 2022 cycle. In Pennsylvania, another competitive race, candidates spent $167 million. And in Florida, they spent $130 million, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/most-expensive-races" target="_blank">according to</a> Open Secrets.</p>
<p>The most expensive House election during 2022 was in California’s 47th District, where candidates spent nearly $32 million. Democrat Katie Porter, who is now running for Senate in the primary, won that race.</p>
<p>The 14th Congressional District in Georgia came in second, with candidates spending nearly $30 million. Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene ultimately won that seat.</p>
<p>The third-and-fourth-most expensive House races were in the California districts held by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and McCarthy.</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, had the fifth-most-expensive House race in the state’s 1st Congressional District. Candidates there spent more than $20 million.</p>
<p>With control of the House, Senate and White House all in front of voters this November, it’s likely that campaign spending records will be set once again.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The winner of next year’s presidential election could very well be holding the reins when it comes time to address Social Security’s complicated financial situation.</p>
<p>The program, which millions of retirees depend on for income stability, will see benefits cut by nearly a quarter in 2033 if Congress and the White House haven’t reached agreement before then.</p>
<p>And while both Democrats and Republicans say they want to “save” Social Security, there’s very little agreement or specifics in their campaign platforms about how lawmakers should avoid a reduction in benefits, or even when negotiations should begin.</p>
<p>Social Security is one of the more important topics a political candidate can talk about, given that 57% of voters said “securing Social Security” was a top priority for them when Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/02/16/publics-top-priority-for-2022-strengthening-the-nations-economy/" target="_blank">surveyed</a> adults in 2022.</p>
<p>And Social Security recipients are more likely than many other age groups to vote.</p>
<p>The longer lawmakers wait to address the solvency crisis, the harder it will be to fix the problem, a frustrating situation for those who have been talking about it for years.</p>
<p>“We have to redefine what the third rail is,” Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy said during a discussion on Social Security last year. “The third rail, according to our leading presidential candidates, is that you pretend there’s nothing wrong with Social Security.”</p>
<p>The third rail, a long-used metaphor for policy areas that politicians don’t want to touch, should instead be about the consequences of allowing Social Security to go past that fiscal cliff, triggering a sharp decrease in benefits and doubling “the rate of poverty among the elderly,” Cassidy said.</p>
<p>“That should be the third rail,” he said. “The conversation has to change to that.”</p>
<p>Cassidy, the top Republican on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, criticized the leading presidential contenders during that April <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kA_jfNO-MCM&amp;t=4s" target="_blank">discussion</a> for not having more detailed, proactive plans for avoiding a reduction in Social Security benefits.</p>
<p>“It’s going to require a president to provide leadership in bringing a bipartisan group together to avoid this 24% cut that’s scheduled to occur,” Cassidy said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Little but talking points</h4>

	
<p>Whoever wins the presidential election in November would hold the title until at least January 2029, just a few years before the cliff is set to take effect, absent action by Congress.</p>
<p>But, neither President Joe Biden nor any of the top Republican primary contenders have laid out detailed proposals or gone beyond talking points.</p>
<p>Dan Adcock, director of government relations &amp; policy at the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said during an interview with States Newsroom that it “behooves the president to try to come up with a proposal that would extend solvency and not have to wait until the last minute.”</p>
<p>The longer the next president and Congress put off negotiations about potentially changing benefits or possibly increasing revenue, or both, “the effectiveness of those proposals go down as you get closer to the solvency day,” Adcock said.</p>
<p>One of the main obstacles once talks do begin, he said, is that Democrats and Republicans “seem to be diametrically opposed to the other side’s solution.”</p>
<p>Then, the politics will come into play, potentially causing issues for those in the GOP.</p>
<p>“Especially on the Republican side, there is a growing understanding that proposals to cut benefits are deeply unpopular, even amongst their own political base,” Adcock said. “And so they’re trying to come up with other ideas to suggest ‘Well, let’s grow the economy’ and ‘Let’s drill for oil,’ and ‘Let’s find other sources of revenue.’ But I’m skeptical that those are really what you need to extend solvency.”</p>
<p>Polling suggests Americans would rather see Social Security taxes increased than have benefits cut. According to those <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/546890/americans-upbeat-future-social-security-benefits.aspx#:~:text=Majorities%20of%20Democrats%20(69%25),independents%20and%2027%25%20of%20Democrats." target="_blank">surveyed</a> in December by Gallup, 61% said the federal government should raise Social Security taxes, while 31% said it should cut benefits. The remaining people said they had no opinion.</p>
<p>That trend has existed for nearly 20 years, according to prior polling from Gallup.</p>
<p>Here’s what the leading contenders for president have said about addressing Social Security’s financial problems.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden</h4>

	
<p>Biden’s latest <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/budget_fy2024.pdf" target="_blank">budget proposal</a> said his administration “is committed to protecting and strengthening Social Security and opposes any attempt to cut Social Security benefits for current or future recipients.”</p>
<p>“The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to responsibly strengthen Social Security by ensuring that high-income individuals pay their fair share,” it said.</p>
<p>The budget request, however, didn’t include details about how Biden wants lawmakers to address the looming solvency issue with Social Security. And the White House hasn’t taken steps to begin serious negotiations with lawmakers.</p>
<p>The Biden campaign website has no policy section and no proposals regarding his plans for Social Security. The campaign did not respond to a request for details.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump</h4>

	
<p>During a <a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/shared/n-yXIR0AGefvvPNGoCTG1y2NKaY1usX00MMaeuK4y5PtSs7rBV5fBbbvAu81HCAIAHvaaSGNmPMQ8mzrK7Ccx3oaJXQ?loadFrom=PastedDeeplink&amp;ts=1841.91" target="_blank">town hall</a> with Fox News’ Sean Hannity in early December, former President Donald Trump suggested the United States should sell more fossil fuels to address Social Security finances.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to touch Social Security,” Trump said. “We have money laying in the ground far greater than anything we can do by hurting senior citizens with their Social Security.”</p>
<p>Trump criticized other GOP presidential candidates for suggesting that the United States should increase the eligibility age for Social Security, saying that raising it to 75 would lead to people being “devastated.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign’s website does have a policy section but doesn’t include any proposals for Social Security. The campaign did not respond to a request asking for information about what he would do if elected.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Haley</h4>

	
<p>In a September <a href="https://nikkihaley.com/2023/09/22/nikki-haleys-economic-freedom-speech/" target="_blank">speech</a> laying out her economic proposals, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley said she promised to “protect those receiving Social Security and Medicare.”</p>
<p>“We’ll keep these programs the same for anyone who’s in their 40s, 50s, 60s, or older, period,” Haley said. “And we’ll preserve Social Security and Medicare for the next generation.”</p>
<p>Haley said she would change the eligibility age “for younger people who are just entering the system” and that she planned to “limit benefits for wealthy people.”</p>
<p>“I recognize that Social Security and Medicare are the last thing the political class wants to talk about. Well, I just did,” Haley said. “Any candidate who refuses to address them should be disqualified.”</p>
<p>Haley’s campaign website doesn’t include any proposals about Social Security and the campaign didn’t return a request for details about whether one exists or what it might propose.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">DeSantis</h4>

	
<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis indicated during an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNXvwvAVRIk" target="_blank">interview</a> on Fox News that he doesn’t support changing Social Security benefits for current retirees, though he would be open to altering how the program works for younger people.</p>
<p>“I’m a governor of Florida; of course we’re going to protect people’s Social Security,” DeSantis said. “My grandma passed away when she was 91. That was her sole source of income. That’s true for millions of seniors. So that goes without saying.”</p>
<p>It would be a “much different thing” to talk “about making changes for people in their 30s or 40s so that the program is viable,” DeSantis said.</p>
<p>“And that’s something that I think there’s going to need to be discussions on,” he said.</p>
<p>DeSantis’ campaign website doesn’t include any policy proposals for Social Security.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Christie </h4>

	
<p>Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dmXJ99oC4k" target="_blank">GOP debate in November</a> that the biggest factors affecting Social Security are eligibility for the program, the age when people can begin collecting either partial or full benefits and taxes.</p>
<p>Christie said Americans are already “overtaxed” and ruled out that change. On eligibility, he said that wealthy people shouldn’t be able to collect Social Security, but didn’t list a threshold for cutting off access to the program for those with high incomes.</p>
<p>Christie declined to go into specifics about raising the eligibility age, but said his 30-year-old son should be able to adjust his retirement savings if the federal government were to increase the age when Americans can begin collecting either partial or full Social Security benefits.</p>
<p>“We have to deal with this problem,” Christie said, suggesting an increase to the eligibility age by a “few years” for people in their 30s and 40s.</p>
<p>“I have a son who’s in the audience tonight who’s 30 years old,” Christie said. “If he can’t adjust to a few years increase in the Social Security retirement age over the next 40 years, I’ve got bigger problems with him than his Social Security payments.”</p>
<p>Christie’s campaign website doesn’t include any policy proposals or details about how he would address Social Security’s future if elected president.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ramaswamy</h4>

	
<p>Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has said during debates and on the campaign trail that he doesn’t want to see any cuts to Social Security for retirees, but he hasn’t released a proposal for how to avoid the reduction in benefits that will take effect in a decade if the government doesn’t address the program’s financial situation.</p>
<p>“So this is really important right now,” he said in response to a question about Social Security during the November debate. “We’re working within the last window, I believe we will have to actually fix this problem while still leaving Social Security and Medicare benefits for current seniors intact.”</p>
<p>He said preserving Social Security could be achieved with proposals that are highly unlikely to ever move through Congress, including reducing the number of federal employees by 75%. He also proposed eliminating military assistance and foreign aid.</p>
<p>“I believe this is our last best window to be able to take care of our national debt problem through those severe measures, including sacrificing the foreign wars that many bloodthirsty members of both parties have a hunger for,” he said.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy’s campaign website doesn’t have any proposals addressing Social Security’s solvency.</p>

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Congress got next to nothing done during the past year and could accomplish even less in 2024 as attention shifts to the November elections.</p>
<p>House Republican and Senate Democratic leaders reached agreement on bills and resolutions they sent to the president’s desk just 34 times during the first year of the 118th Congress — making that session the least productive in decades.</p>
<p>Even when the two chambers brokered deals, several of the laws passed were just short-term extensions, allowing members of Congress to delay the tough job of compromise on big-picture legislation. They’ll need to tackle the farm bill, reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration and approve more than $1.5 trillion in federal spending this year, just to name a few of the unaddressed items.</p>

<p>Rank-and-file lawmakers aren’t entirely pleased with the lackluster results and have no insight on what leaders might bring up this year, outside of the pressing issues they’ve avoided dealing with and now must confront again in 2024.</p>
<p>Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy rebuked GOP leaders, saying during a floor speech in mid-November that for years he’s heard nothing but “excuses” and “empty promises.”</p>
<p>“I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing, one thing, that I can go campaign on and say we did,” Roy said. “Anybody sitting in the complex, if you want to come down to the floor and come explain to me one material, meaningful, significant thing the Republican majority has done besides saying, ‘Oh, it is not as bad as the Democrats.’”</p>
<p>Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole, chair of the House Rules Committee, said in late December he hadn’t heard what legislation would move through his committee this year, but doesn’t expect much.</p>
<p>“Look, it’s divided government in a presidential year,” Cole said. “I don’t see us moving a lot of big legislation. I think the appropriations bills, and whatever the two sides agree should be attached to them, is probably the best you’re going to get.”</p>
<p>Cole said Democrats, who control the Senate, are just as much to blame for the low number of laws as Republicans, who control the House. But, he noted that it’s not necessarily a bad thing for Congress to be less productive than normal.</p>
<p>“If you’re Republican, you believe in less government, and not doing something is sometimes a good thing,” Cole said. “Just because we passed a law, doesn’t mean it was a good law and doesn’t mean it has a positive effect. But again, I think it’s more a function of what the distribution of power is, how polarized the country is right now.”</p>
<p>For the last three decades, Congress has been significantly more productive during its first session, typically passing at least 90 public laws in that first year.</p>
<p>On just two occasions have lawmakers not reached that benchmark; during the 117th Congress when there were 81 public laws during the first year and during the 113th there were just over 70 public laws.</p>
<p>Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, chair of the Agriculture Committee, said there won’t be much time left in 2024 after factoring in work on the farm bill, government funding legislation and the elections.</p>
<p>“I’m continuing to work hard to get a bipartisan farm bill and work through issues related to that,” Stabenow said. “And then there certainly will be other things that need to be addressed as well. But way too much time is going to be taken up by appropriations.”</p>
<p>The elections, she said, “will take a lot of the attention” away from legislative work in Congress.</p>
<p>“They always do,” Stabenow said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shutdown headaches</h4>

	
<p>Congress isn’t set to return to Capitol Hill until Jan. 8, less than two weeks before a Jan. 19 deadline to complete work on four of the government funding bills. The deadline for the remaining eight bills comes two weeks after that, on Feb. 2.</p>
<p>Lawmakers were supposed to approve the full dozen bills before the start of the current fiscal year on Oct. 1, but they’ve used two stopgap bills to push off making any final decisions.</p>
<p>Senators will need to continue negotiations on border security and immigration policy in order to move forward with a $110 billion emergency funding package for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and U.S. border security.</p>
<p>Republicans have insisted they won’t approve the emergency funding until there’s a bipartisan agreement to change when and how immigrants, including asylum seekers, are allowed to enter the United States.</p>
<p>Lawmakers will need to address a long-term reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration after passing a short-term, temporary extension in December.</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats will need to broker a deal on how to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, especially the section of the law that allows for warrantless searches of the electronic communications of non-citizens living outside the United States.</p>
<p>The program has been criticized by members of both political parties for several reasons, including that the process inevitably gains access to Americans’ phone calls, emails and other forms of communication without a court order.</p>
<p>Lawmakers will need to reach a bipartisan deal on the five-year reauthorization of the farm bill, another must-pass piece of legislation that Congress did not actually finish work on last year.</p>
<p>In the Senate, Democrats are expected to keep confirming President Joe Biden’s judicial and executive nominations. That task would likely fall along the wayside if Republicans gain control of that chamber in November and Biden remains president.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Impeachment could move ahead</h4>

	
<p>In the House, lawmakers could become increasingly occupied with the GOP’s attempts to impeach Biden, though Speaker Mike Johnson insists he’s not going to bring that to the floor before there’s sufficient evidence.</p>
<p>Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said during his last <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?532376-1/house-republican-leadership-news-conference" target="_blank">press conference</a> of 2023 that he viewed impeaching Biden as a legal decision and not a political one.</p>
<p>But he declined to set a timeline for an impeachment vote, despite calls from some conservative members to move quickly, possibly before the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>“If you follow the Constitution and you do the right thing, you cannot rush it,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>The House began an unofficial impeachment inquiry into Biden last year when Kevin McCarthy was still speaker. After Johnson became speaker, the chamber voted along party lines in December <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-republicans-back-formal-impeachment-inquiry-against-biden-6" target="_blank">to open an official impeachment inquiry</a>.</p>
<p>Oversight and Accountability Chair James Comer of Kentucky, Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan of Ohio and Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith of Missouri are the three GOP lawmakers leading up the impeachment inquiry.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election overwhelms everything else</h4>

	
<p>Republican lawmakers in the House and Democratic senators aren’t entirely sure what else may make its way onto the floor next year, though they all expect the November elections will overshadow Congress.</p>
<p>The entire House and one-third of the Senate will be up for reelection. Voters will also decide whether Democrats maintain control of the White House or if they want a Republican to sit in the Oval Office once again.</p>
<p>Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said during the first half of next year he plans to focus on the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual policy bill that lawmakers just approved in December but will need to debate and pass all over again this year.</p>

<p>Congress could take up a Supreme Court ethics bill, following a string of stories from ProPublica exposing lavish gifts and trips that Justice Clarence Thomas took without disclosing, Kaine said.</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ethics-rules-supreme-court-justices-approved-party-line-vote-us-senate-panel" target="_blank">approved a new code of ethics</a> for the nation’s highest court in July, but that bill hasn’t made its way onto the floor. The justices <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-unveils-new-ethics-code-critics-say-it-doesnt-go-far-enough" target="_blank">released their own ethics code</a> in November, but many critics of their transparency said it didn’t do enough.</p>
<p>“I think Supreme Court ethics would be a good thing to vote on,” Kaine said.</p>
<p>Virginia Republican Rep. Bob Good, incoming chair of the House Freedom Caucus, said in mid-December that he expects the group of far-right lawmakers will have input into that chamber’s legislative agenda.</p>
<p>Good didn’t list any bills he wants leadership to put on the floor this year but said “we’re having discussions about that very thing.”</p>
<p>Republicans, Good said, need to be “united as a party in cutting our spending, securing our border and defending our constitutional freedoms.”</p>
<p>Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, declined to say if there are any bills he wants party leadership to bring to the floor next year to highlight the differences between the two parties.</p>
<p>But he did say there will be “no shortage of ways to show … the clear differences between Democrats and Republicans.”</p>
<p>“We’ll highlight that in the campaigns and we’ll continue to do that next year,” Peters said.</p>
<p>Florida Republican Rep. Kat Cammack said she’d like to see the House take up an overhaul of the spending process and border security legislation, but she noted that many of the GOP bills won’t move through the Democratic Senate.</p>
<p>“We can’t control the Senate,” Cammack said. “And the Senate has been exceptional in the sense they have not picked up hardly anything that the House has passed.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Supreme Court announced Wednesday it will hear oral arguments and decide whether broad access to the abortion pill can remain legal across the United States.</p>
<p>The justices’ <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121323zr_f204.pdf" target="_blank">decision to hear the case</a> this term will put abortion access and the politics that comes with it back in front of the nation’s highest court just before voters head to the polls for the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>The drug at the center of the case, mifepristone, is used in more than half of pregnancy terminations within the United States as part of a two-pharmaceutical regimen that includes misoprostol as the second medication. Both are also used in miscarriage treatment.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wOSv3s494J"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/19/56-of-virginia-abortions-were-performed-via-medication-in-2021/">56% of Virginia abortions were performed via medication in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;56% of Virginia abortions were performed via medication in 2021&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/19/56-of-virginia-abortions-were-performed-via-medication-in-2021/embed/#?secret=bz0rhKsuzU#?secret=wOSv3s494J" data-secret="wOSv3s494J" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Patients’ ability to access mifepristone cannot change until the Supreme Court issues its ruling, under an order the court put out earlier this year.</p>
<p>The nine members of the court will be answering three questions in their ruling, including whether changes the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made to prescribing and dosage in 2016 and 2021 were “arbitrary and capricious.” Those changes that expanded access included shipping the abortion pill to patients through the mail.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will also decide if the federal district court judge who ruled earlier this year to overturn the FDA’s original 2000 approval of the pharmaceutical “properly granted preliminary relief.”</p>
<p>Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a written statement the Supreme Court “has never invalidated a long-standing FDA approval like they are being asked to do here.”</p>
<p>“The stakes are enormous in post-Roe America,” Northup said. “Even those living in states with strong protections for abortion rights could have their ability to access mifepristone severely restricted if the Court rules against the FDA.”</p>
<p>Northup said the ability for health care providers to prescribe the medication through telehealth and for patients to get it delivered to their homes became “critical” after the court ended the constitutional right to an abortion last year.</p>
<p>“Abortion pills have been used safely in the U.S. for more than 20 years, and they are more important than ever in this post-Roe landscape,” Northup said. “That is precisely why the anti-abortion movement is attacking them.”</p>
<p>Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Erin Hawley said in a written statement the anti-abortion organization urged the Supreme Court to determine “that the FDA acted unlawfully in removing common-sense safeguards for women and authorizing dangerous mail-order abortions.”</p>
<p>“Like any federal agency, the FDA must rationally explain its decisions,” Hawley said. “Yet its removal of common-sense safeguards — like a doctor’s visit before women are prescribed chemical abortion drugs — does not reflect scientific judgment but rather a politically driven decision to push a dangerous drug regimen.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Constitutional right to abortion overturned</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The nine Supreme Court justices who will hear the case and ultimately render a ruling are the same justices who <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2022/06/24/u-s-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion-in-landmark-decision/" target="_blank">overturned the constitutional right to abortion</a> in a June 2022 ruling.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank">majority opinion </a>in that case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the conservative justices wrote that “the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.”</p>
<p>Following that decision, states throughout the country began to implement laws of their choosing, with some setting significant restrictions on when abortion is legal and other states moving to expand access.</p>
<p>Several states have prohibited legal access to the abortion pill mifepristone, despite it being an FDA-approved pharmaceutical.</p>
<p>In mid-November 2022, Alliance Defending Freedom <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-judge-could-decide-soon-february-yank-abortion-pill-nationwide" target="_blank">filed a lawsuit </a>challenging the original approval of the abortion pill in 2000 as well as the changes to when and how the drug could be used that were made in 2016 and during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American College of Pediatricians and the Christian Medical &amp; Dental Associations as well as four doctors from California, Indiana, Michigan and Texas.</p>

<p>U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-administration-appeals-judges-ruling-ordering-abortion-pill-us-market" target="_blank">ruled in April 2023</a> that mifepristone should be removed from the market entirely, though he wrote that he did “not second-guess FDA’s decision-making lightly.”</p>
<p>“But here, FDA acquiesced on its legitimate safety concerns — in violation of its statutory duty — based on plainly unsound reasoning and studies that did not support its conclusions,” Kacsmaryk wrote.</p>
<p>The Biden administration requested the ruling be placed on hold until it could appeal the case, which was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-preserves-access-abortion-pill-lawsuit-continues" target="_blank">ultimately granted by the Supreme Court.</a> That stay from the justices ensured mifepristone remains legal until they issue a ruling.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">5th Circuit ruling</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The case went before the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, which <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-panel-us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">heard arguments</a> in May 2023.</p>
<p>The three-judge panel <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-pill-stay-market-until-us-supreme-court-ruling-after-appeals-court-order-0" target="_blank">ruled</a> in August 2023 that it believed the abortion pill should stay available nationwide, but that dosage and use should revert to what was in place before the FDA began implementing changes in 2016.</p>
<p>That ruling was immediately placed on hold pending an appeal to the Supreme Court. Had the justices decided not to hear the appeal, that ruling would have taken effect.</p>
<p>Going back to what was in place before 2016 would prevent mifepristone from being prescribed during a telehealth appointment or sent through the mail.</p>
<p>Only doctors would be able to prescribe mifepristone, removing the option for other health care providers with the ability to prescribe medication from being able to do so with that particular drug.</p>
<p>Prescriptions could only be written for up to seven weeks gestation, less than the 10-week threshold currently used by prescribers.</p>
<p>Patients would need to attend three in-person doctor’s office appointments in order to receive a medication abortion. The dosage and timing of mifepristone as well as the second drug, misoprostol, would both revert to what was used more than seven years ago.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">DOJ appeal</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Following the 5th Circuit’s ruling, the U.S. Justice Department <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-justice-department-asks-supreme-court-take-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">appealed its ruling to the Supreme Court</a>, arguing the two lower courts made “serious legal errors.”</p>
<p>“The loss of access to mifepristone would be damaging for women and healthcare providers around the Nation,” the DOJ wrote in the 42-page document. “For many patients, mifepristone is the best method to lawfully terminate their early pregnancies. They may choose mifepristone over surgical abortion because of medical necessity, a desire for privacy, or past trauma.”</p>
<p>“Surgical abortion is an invasive medical procedure that can have greater health risks for some patients, such as those who are allergic to anesthesia,” DOJ added.</p>
<p>Numerous medical organizations have filed briefs to either the district court or the appeals court or both, arguing that science supports the use of mifepristone for medication abortion up to 10 weeks.</p>
<p>More than a dozen medical groups — including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Medical Association and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine — wrote in a 48-page <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.213145/gov.uscourts.ca5.213145.354.0.pdf" target="_blank">brief</a> filed in the appeals case that the “overwhelming weight of the scientific evidence supports the FDA’s finding that mifepristone is safe and effective.”</p>
<p>“Mifepristone is one of the most studied medications prescribed in the U.S. and has a safety profile comparable to ibuprofen,” they wrote.</p>
<p>The medical organizations wrote that “denying or limiting access to mifepristone will not make patients safer — it will actively jeopardize their health.”</p>
<p>“Pregnancy can be dangerous,” they wrote. “The risks of maternal mortality in the U.S. are alarmingly high and drastically higher for Black women, poor women, and all those whose access to reproductive care has been historically and geographically limited.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The chair of the House Oversight Committee is calling on a government watchdog to investigate any “political interference” in the site selection process for the new FBI headquarters.</p>
<p>In addition, as House Republicans step up their interest in the growing dispute between Maryland and Virginia over where the headquarters should be moved from its current location on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., another House panel has scheduled a hearing for next week on the site selection.</p>
<p>Oversight Chair James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who sits on the panel, sent a letter to the General Services Administration’s acting Inspector General on Tuesday, asking him to look into why the agency chose a Maryland location over two other sites.</p>
<p>“Congress created GSA in 1949 to increase the efficiency and economy of federal government operations — not least the procurement and use of property,” the two wrote. “To fulfill that mission, GSA must be fair and transparent in its operations. Its real estate dealings should consider only what is best for taxpayers and the Nation. It must set aside political or parochial interests.”</p>
<p>Comer and Connolly wrote in the <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Comer-Connolly-Letter-to-GSA-IG.pdf" target="_blank">two-page letter</a> they are “deeply concerned that GSA’s choice of a new FBI headquarters site departed from those principles — and in doing so, failed to put taxpayers and the public interest first.”</p>
<p>The acting Inspector General <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/investigation-launched-site-selection-process-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank">announced last week</a> that he was “initiating an evaluation of GSA’s selection of the site.”</p>
<p>That process, he wrote in a <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/a/2/a27db5c7-ef2f-42d2-a6e5-5d6de18e414e/12685CFA0AED8209BB165E7A5C99D1E7.gsa-ig-reply-to-sen.warner-re-fbi-site-concerns.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, would “assess the agency’s process and procedures for the site selection to relocate the FBI Headquarters.”</p>
<p>“We intend to begin this work immediately and will share with you and the relevant committees a copy of any report which may result from this evaluation,” the acting Inspector General wrote.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for the Oversight Committee and Connolly didn’t immediately respond to a question from States Newsroom about why the evaluation already underway wouldn’t address their concerns with the process.</p>
<p>The GSA did not respond to a question about the differences between evaluations and investigations, but its website says the agency has an Office of Inspections and an Office of Investigations.</p>
<p>The Office of Inspections “analyzes and evaluates GSA’s programs and operations through management and programmatic inspections and evaluations that are intended to provide insight into issues of concern to GSA, Congress, and the American public.”</p>
<p>The Office of Investigations is a “statutory federal law enforcement organization that conducts nationwide criminal, civil, and administrative investigations of illegal or improper activities involving GSA programs, operations, and personnel.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Pause’ urged</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The General Services Administration <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maryland-confirmed-pick-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank">selected Greenbelt, Maryland, as the location </a>for the new headquarters in early November, following well over a decade of stops and starts. The final three options also included sites in Springfield, Virginia, and Landover, Maryland.</p>

<p>Lawmakers in Maryland were pleased with the decision, but Virginia officials immediately began to question whether it was legitimate. Shortly afterward, the acting inspector general opened the evaluation.</p>
<p>Eleven members of Virginia’s congressional delegation wrote to the Biden administration on Monday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-urged-hold-fbi-hq-move-maryland-while-review-continues" target="_blank">calling for a “pause”</a> on the new FBI headquarters in Greenbelt until that evaluation was completed.</p>
<p>Maryland lawmakers, including members of Congress and Gov. Wes Moore, have maintained that the site selection process was above board and rejected requests to halt progress.</p>
<p>A dozen of those Maryland lawmakers issued a joint statement Monday evening saying they “remain confident that any Inspector General evaluation will find what we know to be true: the Greenbelt site won on the merits.”</p>
<p>“After assessing the facts, the GSA determined that Greenbelt offers the lowest price and best value to taxpayers, the shortest proximity to public transportation, the most schedule certainty to ensure the FBI can move to a new headquarters that meets its mission and security needs as soon as possible, and the greatest opportunity to advance the Biden-Harris Administration’s equity goals,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Those lawmakers included Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin, the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, and Kweisi Mfume, a member of the committee.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tuesday U.S. House hearing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Debate over the FBI headquarters will get its own congressional hearing next week when the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure’s subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management holds a hearing on the issue.</p>
<p>The hearing, titled “Ensuring Transparency in the Federal Government: An Examination of GSA’s Site Selection for the FBI Headquarters,” is scheduled to take place Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern.</p>
<p>The subcommittee is chaired by Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry, with Dina Titus of Nevada as the top Democrat. The panel, however, doesn’t include any members of the Maryland or Virginia congressional delegations.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Virginia lawmakers are asking the Biden administration to “pause” work on a new headquarters for the Federal Bureau of Investigation until a government watchdog can complete a review into how a Maryland site was selected.</p>
<p>The letter from 11 members of Virginia’s congressional delegation to Shalanda Young, director of the Office of Management and Budget, urges her agency to place a temporary hold on the project.</p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/investigation-launched-into-site-selection-process-for-new-fbi-headquarters/</p>
<p>“It is vital that both GSA and the FBI fully cooperate and provide relevant information to the Inspector General’s review, and that they allow time and space for investigatory efforts to reach a thorough conclusion,” the Virginia lawmakers wrote. “We urge the Administration to pause efforts to advance this headquarters process, allowing for transparent and fair review.”</p>
<p>The General Services Administration has been working to select a location for the new FBI headquarters for well over a decade — ultimately narrowing down the choices to Greenbelt, Maryland; Landover, Maryland; and Springfield, Virginia.</p>
<p>The GSA <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maryland-confirmed-pick-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank">selected</a> Greenbelt as the location in early November, leading to celebrations in Maryland and frustrations from many of Virginia’s elected officials.</p>
<p>The agency’s acting Inspector General, at the urging of Virginia lawmakers, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/investigation-launched-site-selection-process-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank">announced last week</a> he was “initiating an evaluation of GSA’s selection of the site.”</p>
<p>“Our objective will be to assess the agency’s process and procedures for the site selection to relocate the FBI Headquarters,” Acting Inspector General Robert Erickson wrote.</p>
<p>Members of Virginia’s congressional delegation said Monday that work on the FBI headquarters should pause until that evaluation is complete. And they sought to emphasize concerns raised by FBI Director Christopher Wray.</p>
<p>“All of the parties involved, including GSA and the FBI, had previously stated publicly the need for a process that was fair, transparent, and determined by the merits of the prospective sites,” they wrote. “In light of the objections from the FBI, there is concern that this standard was not met. This process must be paused to allow for a fair and transparent review to address these concerns.”</p>
<p>Those members include Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats; Democratic Reps. Don Beyer, Gerry Connolly, Jennifer McClellan, Bobby Scott, Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton; and Republican Reps. Morgan Griffith, Jen Kiggans and Rob Wittman.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The watchdog for the General Services Administration will investigate the process that led the federal agency to choose a Maryland site over two others for the new FBI headquarters.</p>

<p>“We intend to begin this work immediately and will share with you and the relevant committees a copy of any report which may result from this evaluation,” Erickson wrote in the <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/a/2/a27db5c7-ef2f-42d2-a6e5-5d6de18e414e/12685CFA0AED8209BB165E7A5C99D1E7.gsa-ig-reply-to-sen.warner-re-fbi-site-concerns.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> to Virginia Sen. Mark Warner.</p>
<p>Eleven members of Virginia’s congressional delegation cheered the decision in a joint statement and called for the GSA to “pause all activities related to the relocation until the IG’s investigation is complete.”</p>
<p>“Given the overwhelming evidence suggesting that the General Services Administration (GSA) administered a site selection process fouled by politics, we agree that an inspector general investigation is the appropriate next step,” the Virginia lawmakers wrote.</p>
<p>Warner and Sen. Tim Kaine, both Democrats, as well as Democratic Reps. Don Beyer, Gerry Connolly, Jennifer McClellan, Bobby Scott, Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton, and GOP Reps. Morgan Griffith, Jen Kiggans and Rob Wittman signed onto the statement.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Maryland-Virginia battle</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The site selection process for the new headquarters for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose current building in the District of Columbia has been falling into disrepair for years, has lasted for well over a decade. During much of that time Maryland and Virginia lawmakers have sought to get the federal government to pick their state.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maryland-confirmed-pick-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank">announced</a> Greenbelt, Maryland, as its top choice for the new headquarters in early November, setting off celebrations from elected officials in that state and heated comments from Virginia’s lawmakers.</p>
<p>The GSA had been deciding among Greenbelt, Maryland; Landover, Maryland; and Springfield, Virginia.</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fbi-director-slams-selection-process-new-hq-maryland-while-lawmakers-squabble%C2%A0%C2%A0-0" target="_blank">criticized</a> the GSA’s decision in a memo to employees, saying he and others had “concerns about the fairness and transparency in the process,” although he also said those “concerns are not with the decision itself but with the process.”</p>
<p>Maryland Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer rejected criticism of the GSA’s decision during an interview in early November.</p>
<p>“The director wants to be in the District of Columbia. He has made it very clear he wants to be in Washington, D.C. He does not want to move. Almost every expert has said that’s not tenable, consistent with the security of the FBI,” Hoyer said. “So, you know, I’m sorry he feels that way. I think he’s absolutely wrong in his representation.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. senators voted 87-11 to approve legislation Wednesday that would fund the government into next year, clearing the measure for President Joe Biden’s signature.</p>
<p>The stopgap spending bill, sometimes called a continuing resolution or CR, would fund part of the government until mid-January and the rest of the programs within the annual appropriations process through early February. But many hurdles likely remain before a final deal is reached on full-year spending.</p>
<p>Senate Appropriations Chair Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said just before the bill passed that she’s already turned her attention to “what happens next.”</p>
<p>“Because avoiding a shutdown is so very far from mission accomplished,” Murray said. “We have a lot of work to do after the dust settles and before the next shutdown deadline comes up. Now is not the time to pat ourselves on the back.”</p>
<p>That conference process between the House and Senate, Murray said, will require “listening to the other side, making some tough decisions, leaving out partisan nonstarters and writing a bill that can actually pass into law.”</p>
<p>“That is going to make a difference for people we represent at home,” Murray said.</p>
<p>The House <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-stopgap-spending-bill-bipartisan-vote-crucial-test-new-speaker" target="_blank">voted</a> 336-95 to approve the stopgap legislation on Tuesday, and Biden is expected to sign it before current funding expires Friday at midnight. House members abruptly canceled further votes and left D.C. for their Thanksgiving recess on Wednesday morning, after far-right members objected to advancing a different spending bill.</p>
<p>Both of Virginia&#8217;s senators, Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, voted for the stopgap bill. All of Virginia&#8217;s Democratic representatives voted for the measure in the House, as did Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans. Republican Reps. Ben Cline, Bob Good, Morgan Griffith and Rob Wittman voted against the resolution.</p>
<p>“Today, we voted to pass legislation to avert a government shutdown. We have long warned that a shutdown would cause catastrophic damage to Virginia’s economy, hurt our military readiness, and jeopardize Virginians’ ability to access crucial services, like help resolving issues with Social Security or Medicare benefits,&#8221; Warner and Kaine said in a joint statement Wednesday. &#8220;While today’s bipartisan action is a relief, we share Virginians’ frustration with short-term fixes. We will continue to urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass a full-year budget as quickly as possible, and will keep working to ensure that budget includes Virginia’s priorities.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More time needed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6363/text?s=3&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22H.R.+6363%22%7D" target="_blank">stopgap spending bill</a> is intended to give the Republican House, Democratic Senate and White House more time to reach agreement on the dozen full-year spending bills.</p>
<p>Congress was supposed to finish its work by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1 but is relying on the stopgap spending bill to continue current funding levels until a deal is negotiated.</p>
<p>Reaching agreement is a well-established practice for the four leaders of the Appropriations committees — Senate Chair Murray; Senate ranking member Susan Collins, a Maine Republican; House Chair Kay Granger, a Texas Republican; and House ranking member Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat.</p>
<p>The four lawmakers have years of experience working out bipartisan deals on spending bills as well as other legislation, but they all often caution against politics or outside influences meddling in those negotiations.</p>
<p>“Appropriators left to their own devices” can reach agreement, they often say.</p>
<p>But they rarely are left to do their work.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New faces in the talks</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Sign-off on the final dozen full-year bills also falls to the four congressional leaders.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, have plenty of experience negotiating spending bills and other consequential legislation with each other.</p>
<p>Joining them at the table this year will be newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, of New York.</p>
<p>Both are new to forging agreement on the annual appropriations bills, which last year totaled about $1.7 trillion.</p>
<p>Congress will have until Jan. 19 to find compromise on the Agriculture-FDA, Energy-Water, Military Construction-VA and Transportation-HUD spending bills.</p>
<p>They’ll have until Feb. 2 to reach a deal on the Commerce-Justice-Science, Defense, Financial Services, Homeland Security, Interior-Environment, Labor-HHS-Education, Legislative Branch and State-Foreign Operations appropriations bills.</p>

<p>The Senate drafted its dozen spending bills to the total spending levels in the debt limit law that Congress approved this summer. But House Republicans wrote their bills more than $100 billion below those levels and added in dozens of hot-button policy proposals that stand no chance of becoming law.</p>
<p>Collins said Wednesday that she met with Johnson last week to talk about total funding levels and the supplemental spending package that Congress could pass in the coming weeks to fund Israel, Ukraine, Taiwan and U.S. border security.</p>
<p>Ultimately, she said, congressional leaders will be the ones who decide whether to stick to the spending levels in the debt limit law or go in a different direction.</p>
<p>“To me, it should be guided by the numbers in the (Fiscal Responsibility Act), plus the side agreement that was worked out between Speaker McCarthy and President Biden,” Collins said, referring to the debt limit deal from earlier this year and former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, she suggested, the Senate could take up a four-bill spending package that includes the Commerce-Justice-Science, Energy-Water, Defense and Labor-HHS-Education spending bills.</p>
<p>“That might be a good four-bill package that we could bring,” Collins said.</p>
<p>A senior appropriator, speaking on background, said Wednesday that a proposal was circulating that would have the Senate turn to that exact four-bill spending package once it gets back from the Thanksgiving recess.</p>
<p>The Senate has approved a three-bill package with a broadly bipartisan vote, and the House has approved seven bills without Democrats’ support.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House exit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The House was set to vote on two additional spending bills this week, but Republican leaders announced late Wednesday morning the chamber was done until after the Thanksgiving break.</p>
<p>The canceled votes came after the House was unable to adopt the rule that would have set up debate on the Commerce-Justice-Science spending bill, amid anger on the stopgap spending bill from far-right members of the party.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Whip John Thune, of South Dakota, said Wednesday it will be difficult to work out agreements between the two chambers on the dozen appropriations bills before the new deadlines.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest challenges, obviously, is there’s a difference in numbers between the House and the Senate,” Thune said, noting the two chambers will have to deal with that when they begin the conference process.</p>
<p>“And I think we have to give that a chance,” Thune said. “You’ve got a new speaker over there. It seems like people want to cooperate a bit, so let’s see if they can move bills.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Thursday rebuked the site selection process for its new headquarters, while members of Congress from Maryland and Virginia sparred over whether politics unfairly tipped the scales.</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray <a href="https://twitter.com/maxpcohen/status/1722640745494954265/photo/1" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a message to employees that he and others have “concerns about the fairness and transparency in the process,” though he later added those “concerns are not with the decision itself but with the process.”</p>
<p>While working with the General Services Administration, the federal agency tasked with making the decision, Wray wrote the FBI “identified concerns about a potential conflict of interest involving the site selection authority and whether changes that individual made in the final stage of the process adhered to the site selection criteria.”</p>
<p>“Despite our engagement with GSA over the last two months on these issues, our concerns about the process remain unresolved,” Wray wrote.</p>
<p>He didn’t identify the person involved, and lawmakers interviewed by States Newsroom on Thursday didn’t know who he might be referring to.</p>
<p>The FBI “will continue to be clear about our process concerns, even as we work with the GSA toward the design and construction of a facility,” Wray wrote.</p>
<p>Wray didn’t identify the person involved. However, a<a href="https://www.gsa.gov/reference/freedom-of-information-act-foia/foia-library" target="_blank"> trove of documents</a> released by the General Services Administration on Thursday afternoon showed the ultimate decision was made by Nina Albert, the GSA’s former commissioner of public buildings.</p>
<p>Albert, who has since moved on to an appointment as Washington D.C.’s deputy mayor for economic development and planning, previously worked for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which owns the Greenbelt site.</p>
<p>Maryland Matters called and emailed Albert at her D.C. job for a comment Thursday, but did not receive a response. In 2021, General Services Administrator Robin Carnahan concluded that Albert<a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/Enclosure%201.2%20-%20N.Albert_Authorization%20Memo_7.6.21.pdf" target="_blank"> did not have a conflict</a> in the FBI headquarters site selection process.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/FBI%20HQ%20Site%20Selection%20Decision.pdf" target="_blank"> 38-page report</a> detailed how Albert and the GSA ultimately identified the Greenbelt site as the most advantageous. But the newly released documents also included an earlier analysis<a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/FBI%20Site%20Panel%20Recommendation%20Report%20-%20Aug%202023%20-%20Final%20v2_Redacted.pdf" target="_blank"> completed by a  three-person site selection panel</a> in August that concluded that the Springfield site was best, followed by Greenbelt.</p>
<p>Ten of the 13 members of Virginia&#8217;s congressional delegation and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued a statement Thursday after reports on Wray&#8217;s letter that said they were &#8220;deeply disturbed to learn that a political appointee at the General Services Administration overruled the unanimous recommendation of a three-person panel comprised of career experts from the GSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluding that Springfield, Virginia is the site best suited for the new FBI headquarters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have repeatedly condemned political interference in the independent, agency-run site selection process for a new FBI headquarters. Any fair weighing of the criteria points to a selection of Virginia,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;It is clear that this process has been irrevocably undermined and tainted, and this decision must now be reversed.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Marylanders reject criticism of Greenbelt site</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Maryland Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer said during a brief interview at the U.S. Capitol that the site selection process for the new headquarters was “fair,” rejecting criticism about the choice of Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WEWWTMWQiZ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/08/maryland-confirmed-as-pick-for-new-fbi-headquarters/">Maryland confirmed as pick for new FBI headquarters over Virginia</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Maryland confirmed as pick for new FBI headquarters over Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/08/maryland-confirmed-as-pick-for-new-fbi-headquarters/embed/#?secret=ERtYNbSgQI#?secret=WEWWTMWQiZ" data-secret="WEWWTMWQiZ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>“To say that somehow this process was skewed is wrong,” Hoyer said, noting that some in FBI leadership don’t want to move out of downtown Washington, D.C. at all. The current headquarters building, a large brutalist structure on Pennsylvania Avenue NW dedicated in 1975, has been in disrepair for years.</p>
<p>“The director wants to be in the District of Columbia. He has made it very clear he wants to be in Washington D.C. He does not want to move. Almost every expert has said that’s not tenable, consistent with the security of the FBI,” Hoyer said. “So, you know, I’m sorry he feels that way. I think he’s absolutely wrong in his representation.”</p>
<p>Hoyer said he hopes the General Services Administration, which <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maryland-confirmed-pick-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank">announced its pick</a> of Greenbelt over two other locations on Wednesday, doesn’t rethink its decision, though he didn’t rule out the possibility.</p>
<p>“I’ve been here a long time. You think you’ve made a decision and there’s always more to come,” Hoyer said.</p>
<p>How close the new FBI headquarters is to its academy in Quantico, Virginia, wasn’t a significant factor, Hoyer said.</p>
<p>“That was made up and not only was it made up — and I don’t say it’s irrelevant — but the hand of the FBI was put heavily on the scale for proximity to Quantico for the first time in September 2022,” Hoyer said.</p>
<p>Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said the GSA’s decision was “outrageous” and called on the agency to reverse course and pick Virginia after all.</p>
<p>“They cooked the books on this thing and they changed the criteria, which they shouldn’t have done,” Kaine said. “But now we know that even under the changed criteria, the GSA and FBI unanimously recommended that Virginia was the site. And then it got overturned.”</p>
<p>“It’s clearly a double politicization of this effort and the administration should reverse it,” Kaine said.</p>
<p>Maryland Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin said he doesn’t know what others are referring to when they say GSA’s decision to choose Greenbelt was political.</p>
<p>“I really don’t,” Cardin said. “We knew that the FBI was biased in the process on where they wanted to go. And it’s not their choice, it’s GSA’s choice.”</p>
<p>Cardin said during a brief interview that while he wanted the GSA to choose Maryland, it was also the best choice for the FBI.</p>
<p>“I will admit that I’m not objective. But I think I am pretty analytical, and to me, this was a logical decision for GSA to make,” Cardin said. “Maryland was by far the best for the taxpayers. It was the best for the mission. It was the best location for facilities.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Funny business’ alleged by Warner</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner expressed frustration with the process, saying during a brief interview that “a three-person panel of GSA and FBI unanimously chose Virginia.”</p>
<p>“And then there was political interference. There’s been funny business in this process all along,” Warner said. “And Virginia is such an obvious choice, both in terms of needs of the FBI, in terms of cost to the taxpayer in terms of, frankly … diversity around the site of Springfield.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, it appears this was the kind of funny business that was more typical in the Trump administration,” Warner said.</p>
<p>Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen said during a brief interview the GSA shouldn’t revisit its decision to select Greenbelt, Maryland, and instead the federal government should move forward with building the new headquarters.</p>
<p>“Look, this has been going on for over 10 years. This was a fair, transparent process. And the decision was made on the merits and we have to move forward,” Van Hollen said. “It’s disgraceful that the men and women of the FBI are still in a headquarters that’s falling apart. So the decision’s made. End of story. We’re moving on.”</p>
<p>Carnahan, the GSA administrator,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> said in a written statement that the agency is “disappointed that the FBI Director is now making inaccurate claims directed at our agency, our employees, and our site selection plan and process.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any suggestion that there was inappropriate interference is unfounded. The choice of Greenbelt, Maryland, is fully consistent with the decision-making process as well as all laws, regulations, and ethical considerations,” Carnahan said. “We stand behind the process, the decision, and all of the public servants who carefully followed the process and made a good decision on behalf of the FBI and the public.”</span></p>
<p>In pitching Prince George’s County as the ideal site, Maryland lawmakers have <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/03/07/maryland-officials-plan-final-pitch-for-feds-to-relocate-fbi-headquarters-to-the-state/" target="_blank">seized on the Biden administration’s focus on advancing equity</a> in federal agencies’ programs.</p>
<p>Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus issued a statement supporting the decision on Thursday: “The new headquarters will benefit local Black-owned small businesses and bring quality public-sector jobs to Black communities throughout Prince George’s County.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Quantico factor</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>FBI leaders have indicated a preference for a site in D.C. or Virginia throughout the selection process.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2023/06/09/after-fbi-document-shows-preference-for-headquarters-relocation-in-virginia-maryland-officials-blast-off/" target="_blank"> report from June included an analysis</a> of 1,700 badge swipes at the bureau’s training site in Quantico, Virginia, in the summer of 2022. The report showed that 544 employees who work at a facility that would be folded into a new consolidated headquarters made 1,754 trips to Quantico over the course of two months.</p>
<p>The report stated that it was important to ensure that trainings at Quantico continue “unimpeded by distance if the FBI is to properly train and develop its people.”</p>
<p>The Springfield, Virginia, site is about 27 miles from Quantico. The estimated distance from Landover is 51 miles, and from Greenbelt is about 54 miles.</p>
<p>Maryland leaders called the data unresponsive to questions they had about the agency’s workforce and said the “imperfect data” showed only 6% of the FBI workforce traveling to Quantico with any regularity.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s new headquarters will be in Maryland, a significant victory for the state following years of jockeying against Virginia and debate throughout several presidencies about where best to locate the law enforcement agency.</p>
<p>The General Services Administration picked the Greenbelt, Maryland, site Wednesday over the Springfield, Virginia, and Landover, Maryland, options, according to a source with knowledge confirming the GSA’s decision to Maryland Matters and States Newsroom.</p>
<p>GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan said in a written statement to States Newsroom and Maryland Matters that “GSA looks forward to building the FBI a state-of-the-art headquarters campus in Greenbelt to advance their critical mission for years to come.”</p>
<p>“Thank you to everyone at GSA, DOJ, FBI, Congress, and others who helped reach this important milestone after a comprehensive, multi-year effort,” Carnahan said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the federal agency said in a written statement that “GSA determined Greenbelt to be the best site because it was the lowest cost to taxpayers, provided the greatest transportation access to FBI employees and visitors, and gave the government the most certainty on project delivery schedule.</p>
<p>“It also provided the highest potential to advance sustainability and equity,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The Washington Post originally <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/11/08/fbi-headquarters-chosen-greenbelt/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNjk5NDE5NjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzAwODAxOTk5LCJpYXQiOjE2OTk0MTk2MDAsImp0aSI6IjllNWVlOGU1LWUwZTAtNDI0NC1iNTIzLWMyZDg2YjBjZTEwNSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9kYy1tZC12YS8yMDIzLzExLzA4L2ZiaS1oZWFkcXVhcnRlcnMtY2hvc2VuLWdyZWVuYmVsdC8ifQ.iqjIqGNI4-vmKLOIcixSawZVSSFG4llOziz8SIEfb4M" target="_blank">reported</a> the decision.</p>
<p>Virginia Democratic U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine said in a written statement they’re “deeply disappointed that despite the clear case that Virginia is the best home for the FBI, the Administration went a different direction.”</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jZkbYFDAlN"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/12/after-fbi-document-shows-preference-for-hq-relocation-in-virginia-md-officials-blast-off/">After FBI document shows preference for HQ relocation in Virginia, Md. officials blast off</a></p></blockquote>

<p>“We spent years appropriately criticizing the last Administration for politicizing the new FBI headquarters — only for a new Administration to come in and allow politics to taint the selection process,” Warner and Kaine said.</p>
<p>Virginia Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly said in a written statement that he was not given a heads-up about the decision.</p>
<p>“In making this decision, GSA has shamelessly caved to political pressure, putting blatant politics over the merits and amending the weighting of long-established criteria to make this decision all but predictable,” Connolly wrote.</p>
<p>“While Virginia’s loss is also the FBI’s, GSA’s reputation for objective procurement free from politics has taken a mortal hit today from which it will struggle to recover for years into the future,” Connolly added.</p>
<p>Congress will still need to provide funding for construction, which is expected to take several years to complete.</p>
<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation will be moving from its current headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C. The J. Edgar Hoover building, which opened in 1974, puts the FBI between the White House and the U.S. Capitol on a street that presidents often walk down during their Inauguration parades.</p>
<p>Nearly two decades ago, in 2005, the FBI’s Asset Management Plan indicated the agency would soon need a new headquarters, given the building’s structural and space issues.</p>
<p>Plans progressed slowly during the latter years of the Obama administration, but the Trump administration tried to keep the FBI in its existing location, with reports alleging former President Donald Trump didn’t want the site potentially sold to a rival hotel.</p>
<p>Plans to move the FBI headquarters to the suburbs outside of Washington, D.C. began moving forward again during the Biden administration.</p>
<p>The Maryland and Virginia delegations pitched their states to the GSA in March, a provision that was required in a government spending package.</p>
<p>The GSA considered five criteria in picking the new location, including FBI mission requirements, access to transportation, site development flexibility, sustainability and equity, and cost.</p>
<p>FBI mission requirements included the distance to the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia as well as the U.S. Department of Justice in downtown Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The GSA weighted each of the categories, though it changed that criteria in July.</p>
<p>Proximity to the FBI mission-related locations moved from 35% to 25%, transportation access moved from 25% to 20%, site development flexibility stayed at 15%, sustainability and equity increased from 15% to 20% and cost increased from 10% to 20%.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon said his wife slept with a gun for protection after she received threatening phone calls demanding that her husband support Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan’s bid for U.S. House speaker.</p>
<p>Bacon was among a handful of members who reported threats and the targeting of family members after opposing the conservative hardliner’s bid for the speaker’s gavel.</p>
<p>“I didn’t sleep well last night. I called her and I go, ‘How you doing?’ and she said, ‘I slept really good, I had a loaded gun,’” he said Thursday after leaving a Republican conference meeting.</p>
<p>“It was ugly phone calls,” said Bacon, a member of the House Armed Services Committee who <a href="https://bacon.house.gov/about/about-don.htm" target="_blank">served in the U.S. Air Force for nearly 30 years,</a> retiring as a Brigadier General.</p>
<p>Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-stalled-again-after-rejecting-jim-jordan-speaker-second-time" target="_blank">failed twice to garner enough floor votes</a> to reach the gavel. Twenty opposed him Tuesday. By Wednesday that gap grew to 22.</p>
<p>Jordan and his allies employed an aggressive campaign over recent days that included Fox News personality Sean Hannity and conservative talk radio host Glenn Beck stumping for him on air and ridiculing critics.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Threats disclosed by members</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>As Republicans met Thursday behind closed doors in an attempt to recalibrate after 16 days without a speaker, several aired grievances about the Jordan camp’s tactics.</p>
<p>Virginia Rep. Jen Kiggans, who voted against Jordan on the second ballot after supporting him during the first floor vote, told reporters following the closed-door meeting that many lawmakers brought up the threats and intimidation.</p>
<p>“We all share the same conservative values and principles,” Kiggans said. “So to get those threats and to be intimidated by members of our own party was really frustrating, especially for people like me.”</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepJenKiggans/status/1714704984787370165</p>
<p>Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, <a href="https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/briefs/rep-mariannette-miller-meeks-says-she-received-death-threats-after-speaker-vote-against-jordan/" target="_blank">who voted for Jordan</a> on the first ballot but opposed him on the second ballot, said Wednesday in a <a href="https://millermeeks.house.gov/media/press-releases/miller-meeks-statement-speaker-vote-and-death-threats" target="_blank">written statement</a> that she’d received “credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls.”</p>
<p>“One thing I cannot stomach, or support is a bully,” Miller-Meeks said.</p>
<p>“Someone who threatens another with bodily harm or tries to suppress differing opinions undermines opportunity for unity and regard for freedom of speech,” Miller-Meeks said. “I did not stand for bullies before I voted for Chairwoman Granger and when I voted for Speaker designee Jordan, and I will not bend to bullies now.” Rep. Kay Granger is the chair of the House Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>Georgia Rep. Drew Ferguson, who<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/brief/georgia-congressman-ferguson-flipped-support-for-house-speaker-citing-threats-from-jordan-allies/" target="_blank"> supported Jordan on the first floor vote but not the second, </a>said in a written statement that he had “genuine concerns about the threatening tactics and pressure campaigns Jordan and his allies were using to leverage members for their votes.”</p>
<p>“I discussed this directly with Jim, and planned to support him on the second ballot,” Ferguson wrote. “When the pressure campaigns and attacks on fellow members ramped up, it became clear to me that the House Republican Conference does not need a bully as the Speaker.”</p>
<p>After voting against Jordan on the floor on Wednesday, Ferguson wrote that he and his family “started receiving death threats.”</p>
<p>“That is simply unacceptable, unforgivable and will never be tolerated,” Ferguson added.</p>
<p>Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson, who opposed Jordan on both floor votes, wrote on X on Wednesday that “intimidation and threatening tactics do not — and will not — work.”</p>
<p>“Steve Scalise earned my vote for Speaker in the last two rounds,” Simpson wrote. “He has repeatedly proven his leadership as our conference’s Majority Leader, and I am honored to support him.”</p>
<p>Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart of Florida said the “nanosecond” that outside pressure tactics begin, “it’s over” for him.</p>
<p>“If you look at the folks that are getting these threats: Don Bacon, retired general of the United States Armed Forces, you know, I don’t know how anybody can think that folks like that can be pressured,” Díaz-Balart said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jordan stays in the race</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Uncertainty loomed over the Republican conference Thursday.</p>
<p>GOP House members met privately for several hours to try to find a path forward from an essentially frozen lower chamber.</p>
<p>A short-lived proposal to temporarily expand the powers of Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry of North Carolina fizzled out by day’s end.</p>
<p>Jordan remained in the race, but when a next vote would occur remained unclear late Thursday.</p>
<p>Some members, including Jordan supporter Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida, said they think the next step for the conference is to “hash this out.”</p>
<p>“There has been encouragement from all sides of conference, every walk of life, every faction that is represented in there, that at the end of the day, if we can’t agree on anything, we can agree on one thing and that’s the 22 (who oppose Jordan) have to get in a room and talk to Jim,” she said.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House rejected Ohio’s Jim Jordan as a candidate for speaker on Tuesday in the first round of voting, though the chamber was expected to potentially conduct additional votes on Jordan’s bid later in the day.</p>
<p>Jordan, co-founder of the far-right Freedom Caucus and one of the lawmakers who bolstered former President Donald Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election, was unable to clinch the votes needed to hold the gavel amid concerns about his agenda and frustrations with his history inside and outside of Congress. The House has now gone two weeks without a speaker.</p>
<p>Twenty Republicans, including Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, as well as all Democrats, voted against Jordan on the first ballot.</p>
<p>​​Florida Rep. Gus Bilirakis was the only Republican who didn’t vote.</p>
<p>House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, of New York, said in her nomination speech that Jordan is a “patriot” who would “go after corruption and deliver accountability.”</p>
<p>“Jim is the voice of the American people who have felt voiceless for far too long,” Stefanik said. “Whether as Judiciary chair, conservative leader, or representative for his constituents in west central Ohio, whether on the wrestling mat or in the committee room, Jim Jordan is strategic, scrappy, tough and principled.”</p>
<p>House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, of California, nominated New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries for speaker, saying he was the clear candidate for anyone who wanted a bipartisan path ahead.</p>
<p>“The choice before us is simple, come together on a bipartisan path forward, or take us over the cliff,” Aguilar said. “Abandon the extremism that is preventing us from getting things done, or triple down on division and dysfunction.</p>
<p>&#8220;A vote today to make the architect of a nationwide abortion ban, a vocal election denier and an insurrection insider to the speaker of this House would be a terrible message to the country and our allies,” Aguilar said.</p>
<p>There was no majority of the vote needed to elect a speaker, with Jeffries receiving 212 votes and Jordan receiving 200, while other lawmakers got some of the Republican votes.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">McCarthy ousted two weeks ago</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The stalemate comes two weeks after eight House Republicans and Democrats <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank">voted to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker </a>about nine months into his tenure.</p>
<p>McCarthy had to hold 15 separate votes in January before he was able to become speaker and only after making several agreements behind closed doors with far-right members of the party.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HprvO3QuDw"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/03/u-s-house-votes-to-remove-kevin-mccarthy-as-speaker/">U.S. House votes to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker</a></p></blockquote>

<p>After McCarthy announced he wouldn’t try again to become speaker, Louisiana’s Steve Scalise and Jordan <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/louisianas-steve-scalise-and-ohios-jim-jordan-jump-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">announced their bids</a> for the role.</p>
<p>Scalise, currently the majority leader, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-nominated-us-house-gop-speaker-closed-door-meeting" target="_blank">won the first secret ballot nomination vote</a> within the House Republican Conference. But he never scheduled a floor vote and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-drops-out-race-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">withdrew from the race</a> after just one day.</p>
<p>Jordan had said after losing the first nomination vote that he would back Scalise on the floor, but several of his followers refused to back their party’s speaker nominee.</p>
<p>House Republicans huddled again Friday to take a second nomination vote for speaker, choosing between Jordan and Georgia’s Austin Scott.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ohios-jordan-latest-us-house-gop-nominee-speaker-after-days-turmoil" target="_blank">Jordan won that nomination vote</a>, but another secret ballot taken afterward showed that more than 50 House Republicans said they wouldn’t support him during a floor vote.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/jim-jordan-gains-support-vote-nears-us-house-speaker-outcome-still-doubt" target="_blank">gap dwindled over the weekend and throughout Monday </a>as several Republicans, who said they would never back Jordan during a floor vote, announced public support.</p>
<p>Several holdouts remained heading into Tuesday’s floor vote, leaving Jordan short of the roughly 217 votes he would need to become speaker.</p>
<p>Those holdouts maintained their opposition throughout the first ballot on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>“I’m voting for a good, solid, conservative Republican. That’s the only kind of person I’ll vote for,” Rep. Carlos Giménez of Florida said immediately following the vote.</p>
<p>Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota said he anticipated that Jordan might not have all the votes on the first ballot, but he said he remained hopeful that those GOP holdouts would flip.</p>
<p>“A lot of the people who are holding out are very reasonable people,” Johnson said. “It’s my assessment that when people stay at the table that a deal is possible.”</p>
<p>Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer of Oregon, who voted for McCarthy on the first ballot, said she did so because he was the closest Republican to secure the necessary 217 votes, but noted that she would “continue to reassess where things stand as this process plays out.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Attempt to expand McHenry powers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Mike Kelly <a href="https://kelly.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/kelly.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/kellpa_030_xml.pdf" target="_blank">introduced a resolution</a> Monday night to elect Rep. Patrick McHenry as speaker pro tempore for up to 30 days. Approving that resolution would expand McHenry’s powers beyond what they are as the speaker pro tempore by designation, Kelly said.</p>
<p>Under the resolution, McHenry, a North Carolina Republican, would stay in the role until Nov. 17 — the same day government funding is set to expire — or until a new speaker is elected, whichever is first.</p>
<p>McHenry has been serving as the speaker pro tempore by McCarthy’s designation under a process put in place to ensure continuity of government following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>Chavez-DeRemer said she feared the chaos of the last few weeks would only continue under a Jordan speakership. With the Republican conference still bitterly divided, she said the chamber should empower McHenry.</p>
<p>“Until we can find clear consensus among the Republican Conference, it’s time to give expanded authority to Speaker Pro Tempore McHenry so the House can resume governing,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/RepLCD/status/1714327863694959013" target="_blank">wrote on X</a>, formerly Twitter.</p>

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve Scalise withdrew from the race for U.S. House speaker on Thursday evening, just one day after his colleagues nominated him for the role.</p>
<p>“Our conference still has to come together and it’s not there,” Scalise told reporters. “I was very clear we have to have everybody put their agendas on the side and focus on what this country needs. This country is counting on us to come back together, this House of Representatives needs a speaker and we need to open up the House again.”</p>
<p>Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan was the only other declared candidate for speaker. He was <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-nominated-us-house-gop-speaker-closed-door-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">narrowly beaten by Scalise during the conference vote Wednesday</a> and quickly pivoted to backing Scalise while encouraging those who supported him to back Scalise as well.</p>
<p>After announcing he would withdraw his nomination, Scalise did not say whether he would back Jordan for speaker.</p>
<p>“I’m sure there will be a lot of people that look at it,” Scalise said of future candidates for speaker. “But it’s got to be people that aren’t doing it for themselves and their own personal interests.”</p>
<p>While Scalise got a majority of the 221 votes during the closed-door conference meeting, more than a dozen Republican lawmakers said they wouldn’t vote to elect him speaker on the floor.</p>
<p>Scalise announced his decision to step aside following the second meeting of the House Republican Conference on Thursday. The group met for about three hours in the afternoon and then regrouped in a room in the Capitol building’s basement around 7:30 p.m. Eastern.</p>
<p>Georgia’s Marjorie Taylor Greene and Virginia’s Bob Good were among those who said they wouldn’t back Scalise during a floor vote.</p>
<p>The U.S. House has been without a speaker for more than a week after eight GOP lawmakers and Democrats <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted to remove California Rep. Kevin McCarthy </a>from the post after just nine months.</p>
<p>Following Scalise’s nomination withdrawal, McCarthy said that Scalise will still be the party’s majority leader.</p>
<p>He called out the eight Republicans who voted with Democrats to remove him as speaker.</p>
<p>“How do you let 4% of the conference do this to the entire country?” McCarthy said. “I just think the conference as a whole has to figure out their problems, solve it, and select a leader.”</p>
<p>The chamber has been essentially frozen since then, with North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry filling the role of speaker pro tempore. There are still questions on<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/how-does-frozen-us-house-function-without-speaker-everyones-got-opinion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> how the chamber can function</a> in the absence of a speaker.</p>
<p>The pro tem job, created following the 9/11 terrorist attacks to ensure continuity of government, is not clearly defined in House rules.</p>
<p>A House procedure expert told States Newsroom during an <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/theres-still-no-speaker-us-house-could-patrick-mchenry-be-solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> on Thursday that the chamber could temporarily elect McHenry, or any other House member, to the role if they wanted to begin moving resolutions or bills.</p>
<p>Some House Republicans have begun suggesting the party do just that if they cannot elect a speaker on the floor soon.</p>
<p>Support for Jordan is already growing with House Republicans. Jim Banks of Indiana <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJimBanks/status/1712617988573069685" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on X</a>, formerly Twitter, that he would support Jordan as speaker.</p>
<p>“Jim Jordan is a conservative fighter who can unite our party and he continues to have my full support to be the next Speaker of the House,” Banks wrote.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. House Republicans elected Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise as their nominee for speaker Wednesday following a secret ballot vote in a closed-door conference, according to Republicans leaving the meeting.</p>
<p>“We need to make sure we’re sending a message to people all throughout the world, and that the House is open and doing the people’s business,” Scalise told reporters after the meeting.</p>
<p>Scalise did not confirm whether he had all the votes from his party to take the gavel, but said “we’re gonna have to go upstairs on the House floor and resolve this and get the House reopened again.”</p>
<p>The next step for Scalise, who currently is the majority leader, will be garnering the support of nearly all his GOP colleagues to win a floor vote to become speaker, replacing former Speaker Kevin McCarthy of California.</p>
<p>The nominee picked in the conference meeting only needed to get the backing of a majority of the 221 House Republicans, but Scalise will need about 217 on the floor before he can hold the gavel.</p>
<p>When asked whether he would vote for Scalise, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, chair of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, said, “We’re going to go figure it out. Vote’s pretty close.”</p>
<p>“We need to quit having this place run the way it’s run,” he added on how he could be convinced to support the Louisiana Republican.</p>
<p>Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma told reporters as he left the meeting that he will run for House majority leader.</p>
<p>Republicans haven’t yet announced when a floor vote will take place. The House briefly came into session at 3 p.m. and then adjourned.</p>
<p>Reps. Frank Lucas of Oklahoma, Ashley Hinson of Iowa and John James of Michigan gave nominating speeches for Scalise. His path to the nomination was smoothed when Republicans tabled a proposal by Texas Republican Chip Roy to change the rules on how a nominee was selected.</p>
<p>The other candidate was Ohio’s Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>Reps. Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, Erin Houchin of Indiana and Mike Carey of Ohio nominated Jordan.</p>
<p>Reps. Tim Burchett of Tennessee and Matt Gaetz of Florida who voted to oust McCarthy said they would support Scalise on the floor.</p>
<p>“Long live Speaker Scalise,” Gaetz, who filed the motion to vacate McCarthy, said.</p>
<p>The new speaker will have several crises to address as soon as the swearing-in is over.</p>
<p>The first task will likely be addressing the situation in Israel, which is under an ongoing attack from Hamas and possibly other organizations.</p>
<p>Scalise said if elected speaker, one of the first orders of business for the House is to pass a resolution showing the United States support for Israel.</p>
<p>Congress will need to approve supplemental funding <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/10/10/biden-denounces-deadly-hamas-attack-on-israel-theres-no-justification-for-terrorism/" target="_blank">expected to be requested</a> by President Joe Biden, an issue that will garner strong bipartisan support. Biden has <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-denounces-deadly-hamas-attack-israel-theres-no-justification-terrorism" target="_blank">said</a> he wants Congress to take “urgent action” on Israel’s security needs.</p>
<p>Scalise, if elected speaker, will need to work with the Democratic Senate to pass some type of government funding bill ahead of a Nov. 17 deadline. Additional aid to Ukraine could be attached to that package, or a bill carrying aid to Israel.</p>
<p>Scalise also would be tasked with fundraising, protecting centrist Republicans and wrangling far-right conservatives to support his agenda.</p>
<p>However, there are some GOP lawmakers who still plan to vote for Jordan on the House floor, such as Rep. Max Miller of Ohio.</p>
<p>He said he’d back Jordan “because he’s not in leadership.”</p>
<p>“Trust has been shattered in that room,” Miller said. “The only way, in my opinion, that you regain that trust is with a whole new set of people.”</p>
<p>Florida Rep. Kat Cammack said after the closed-door meeting she doesn’t believe Scalise will get the votes needed on the floor to become speaker.</p>
<p>“I think that what’s going to happen at three o’clock is going to be a continuation of the chaos that has plagued the House.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The stunning ouster of U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday — the first time a speaker has been removed in Congress’ 234-year history — created a leadership vacuum in the chamber and left multiple questions about how legislative business would proceed.</p>
<p>North Carolina Republican Patrick McHenry ascended to the role of speaker pro tempore following the vote to unseat McCarthy. McHenry’s rise occurred under a House rule created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that allowed McCarthy to secretly choose a temporary successor in advance, in the event the speaker’s office was vacated.</p>
<p>The rule seems designed to keep the chamber running without an elected speaker, but in an institution governed largely by precedent, the unprecedented nature of the situation provoked a buzz of uncertainty, speculation and opinion in D.C. on the day after McCarthy’s unwilling exit.</p>
<p>“The only thing I’m certain about is that anyone who says that they have any certainty on this is lying,” said Josh Chafetz, a professor of law and politics at Georgetown Law. “There’s absolutely no precedents on any of this because this hasn’t happened before.”</p>
<p>Members were exasperated. “The House of Representatives is effectively frozen,” Rep. Garret Graves, a Louisiana Republican and McCarthy ally, told reporters Wednesday. “We’re not able to actually advance legislation. We can’t even refer bills to committee.”</p>
<p>McHenry has called for House members to vote on the next speaker on Oct. 11. Until then, the House is unlikely to try to conduct business — even as a government funding deadline approaches Nov. 17. But there’s also the possibility that the House won’t — or is unable to — choose a speaker for even longer.</p>
<p>Here are some questions about how the chamber moves forward in the absence of an elected speaker, with answers from legal and congressional experts.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why does the role of speaker pro tempore exist in the U.S. House of Representatives, and what powers does that person hold?</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p>Molly E. Reynolds, senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, said Wednesday during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlhKzpLLLxQ" target="_blank">panel discussion</a> the role of speaker pro tempore was designed as a way to bolster continuity of government.</p>
<p>“The language of the rule itself isn’t entirely clear on what powers the speaker pro tem has — whether it’s all of the powers of the Office of the Speaker, or just authorities that allow him to effectuate a new election for speaker,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>There are two schools of thought about how much power a speaker pro tempore holds, Reynolds said.</p>
<p>“I would put myself in the camp that the speaker pro tem, McHenry, has the full powers of the speakership with the possible exception of sitting in the line of succession,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>“My logic there is that given how this rule was originally designed, which was to allow someone to act as speaker in the event of a real crisis, that you would not necessarily have wanted to develop a rule that would limit that person’s power in an actual emergency,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Other experts agreed with that view.</p>
<p>“The idea behind a pro tempore is: The person can act in the absence of a speaker,” Jason Roberts, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina, told States Newsroom. “So I interpret that to mean the speaker pro tempore can do basically whatever they choose to do.”</p>
<p>Nearly every move McHenry makes would become a precedent for future temporary speakers, Roberts said.</p>
<p>Tests to McHenry’s power could end up being settled by a majority of the House, experts said.</p>
<p>“The way that precedents in the House work when things are unprecedented is when someone does something, that becomes a precedent,” Roberts said. “If someone is unhappy with what they did, they can raise a point of order… And then the House would vote on that, and if they sustain the point of order then that would become the precedent.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How is McHenry approaching the job?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>For the time being, McHenry is taking the more restrained approach to his authority as the temporary speaker of the House. He has not yet referred bills to committee or scheduled floor votes on any legislation, Reynolds said.</p>
<p>But that could change if Republicans cannot quickly elect another speaker.</p>
<p>“This is all pretty untested and it may well be the case that McHenry’s choice to act in this more limited way is a political one,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Because this has never happened before, anything McHenry does during the days or weeks to come could be used as precedent in the future if the House ever needs to lean on another speaker pro tempore, Reynolds said.</p>
<p>“In the kind of situation that this rule originally anticipated — a true catastrophic emergency — I think we would probably want the person acting as speaker pro tem to have more expansive powers than McHenry is at least planning at this moment to exercise,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Steven S. Smith, a professor at Arizona State University, said that if a leadership vacuum persists past next week, McHenry may have to consider a more robust approach.</p>
<p>“If no new speaker manages to get elected that quickly and he remains the speaker pro tem, then I’m guessing that he’ll have to start thinking about exercising the real powers of the speakership,” Smith said.</p>
<p>Though a temporary speaker could — possibly — use many of the official powers of the office, McHenry lacks some of the power speakers typically enjoy as the leader of the House.</p>
<p>McHenry would lack the power to appoint Rules Committee members, for example, which is what allows a speaker to control the House floor and makes the position as powerful as it is, Smith said.</p>
<p>“If McHenry ends up being, say, a medium-term speaker pro tem, it’s going to be somewhat awkward because none of the Rules Committee members owe their presence there to him,” Smith said. “And he’s not empowered to do anything about it under the conference rules.”</p>
<p>McHenry would also lack the power to appoint members to the steering committee, which makes appointments to every committee in the House, Smith said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What exactly does the rule say?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The official <a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules118.house.gov/files/documents/Rules%20and%20Resources/118-House-Rules-Clerk.pdf" target="_blank">rules of the House</a> detail what the chamber should do if the speaker becomes ill for a long period of time, or if the office is vacated.</p>
<p>Section 8(b)(3)(A) of Rule I states: “In the case of a vacancy in the Office of Speaker, the next Member on the list described in subdivision (B) shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore. Pending such election the Member acting as Speaker pro tempore may exercise such authorities of the Office of the Speaker as may be necessary and appropriate to that end.”</p>
<p>What is “necessary and appropriate to that end” is the part that leads to some debate among experts.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What can the House do without a speaker? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The speaker pro tempore position was intended to allow the House to continue to function as normal, even without an elected speaker.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="T3GrEgrl8D"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/03/u-s-house-votes-to-remove-kevin-mccarthy-as-speaker/">U.S. House votes to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;U.S. House votes to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/03/u-s-house-votes-to-remove-kevin-mccarthy-as-speaker/embed/#?secret=IE81tymijg#?secret=T3GrEgrl8D" data-secret="T3GrEgrl8D" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>In practice, though, at least in the short term, it’s a major disruption to House business.</p>
<p>Graves blasted Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican who led the challenge to McCarthy, saying he undermined conservative goals and stripped powers from the Republican office.</p>
<p>“You can’t offer subpoenas, you can’t go after Hunter Biden, you can’t go after any of the controversies that this administration has carried out,” Graves said.</p>
<p>Experts said it was unclear how subpoena power could be affected.</p>
<p>If McHenry becomes more assertive as an acting speaker during a prolonged period without an elected one, the House itself would ultimately decide the extent of that position’s power.</p>
<p>“The most fundamental thing about the House is a majority of the House can do anything the majority wants to do,” Roberts said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can House committees meet for hearings or to report bills to the floor?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Nothing but political considerations would prevent committees from meeting, Smith said.</p>
<p>Committees’ authorities, organized under a rules package approved at the beginning of this Congress and in effect even after McCarthy’s ouster, “don’t change at all,” Roberts said.</p>
<p>“I can’t think of any reason why committees couldn’t meet,” Chafetz said. “Committees don’t need the permission of the speaker to hold a meeting.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Can the House change the rules that allowed for McCarthy’s ouster?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The House can change its rules at any time, through a majority vote on the floor, Smith said.</p>
<p>McCarthy agreed to a rule change allowing any single member to bring a motion to vacate, the procedure that Gaetz used to trigger the speaker’s fall.</p>
<p>With that in mind, McCarthy’s successor may seek to add a minimum number of members who must sign on to such a motion.</p>
<p>Though rules packages are usually only passed at the beginning of a two-year Congress, a majority can choose to change them at any time.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What about the line of succession?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The House speaker is second in the line of succession to the presidency, behind only the vice president.</p>
<p>With that office vacant, the president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, currently Washington Democrat Patty Murray, would move up to second in line, Roberts said. Murray holds the position by virtue of being the most senior member of the Senate’s majority party.</p>
<p>While McHenry could exercise most of the speaker’s powers within the House, he is not technically the speaker for the purposes of succession.</p>
<p>“Officially, the speaker’s office is vacant,” Roberts said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Does the vote to remove McCarthy as speaker increase the odds of a government shutdown or spending cuts?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Reynolds from Brookings said one of the challenges for the next GOP speaker will be when and how to make trade-offs with the hard-right members of the conference or the centrists, who are most at risk of losing reelection next year.</p>
<p>“If you try to pass an appropriations bill that is embraced by those on the right end of the conference, you’re going to lose votes from the left end of the conference,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>“So it’s a much different political struggle to manage those differences in the conference,” Reynolds said. “And that’s not going to go away for whoever is the next speaker of the House, and in some ways the stakes of all of this are going to get higher the longer we go into the fiscal year.”</p>
<p>A provision in the debt limit law that President Joe Biden and McCarthy brokered in May would institute a <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/1-cut-federal-spending-debt-limit-law-its-complicated" target="_blank">1% across-the-board spending cut</a> to defense and domestic discretionary programs next year if Congress cannot pass all 12 of the annual spending bills before the spring.</p>
<p>That provision wouldn’t have any real-world effects until April 30, though if any of the bills aren’t law before then, all of the departments and agencies would be forced to cut spending.</p>
<p>The “Sword of Damocles” provision, as Reynolds called it, will likely galvanize defense hawks in the House and Senate to broker agreement on all the bills before that deadline.</p>
<p>“But one thing that we should take away from this episode, is that if we think what Kevin McCarthy did over the weekend was the right thing, that does not necessarily save him, or any future speaker, from punishment from a dissident faction of his own conference, even though ultimately it may be the right choice for the government and for the country,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Matthew Green, professor of politics at Catholic University of America, said the next Republican speaker will likely have a brief time to broker bipartisan agreements without facing the same motion to vacate that McCarthy did.</p>
<p>“I think there is probably a small window for the next speaker to be able to get things through, even if that requires cooperating with the Democrats and the president — which it almost certainly will — that it won’t necessarily end their speakership,” Green said.</p>
<p>Another challenge for House Republicans is that dealing with the speakership race eats up precious time they need to pass spending bills, Smith said. A new speaker won’t take office until Oct. 11 at the earliest.</p>
<p>“Taking out about 25% of the remaining days before the CR expires is going to put Republicans in a pinch,” Smith said, referring to the continuing resolution that funds the government through Nov. 17.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How did the House Republican Conference get here, and what does it mean for the future?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Green, of Catholic University of America, said that changes in the GOP’s goals over time have partially led to what happened this week when eight members were able to oust a speaker who was backed by more than 210 of his Republican colleagues.</p>
<p>The trend can be traced back to former Speaker Newt Gingrich, and leaders before him, who Green said began shifting the goals to having power, having a majority and communicating. The central goal, he said, wasn’t always legislating.</p>
<p>“That objective and that way of viewing one’s political career gets certain folks elected, who may have genuine views and beliefs and political preferences — but they also don’t see Congress as a place to solve problems and legislate,” Green said. “And that’s in many ways why we are where we are today.”</p>
<p>Philip Wallach, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said sometimes House Republicans “get distracted from the fact that they are members of a legislature that ultimately has to pass laws with majorities of two chambers and get the signature of the president.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How does kicking McCarthy out as speaker affect House Republicans’ fundraising prospects heading into the 2024 elections?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Kevin R. Kosar, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said that the eight Republicans who voted to remove McCarthy might have created long-lasting problems for House GOP fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>“He was a tremendous fundraiser. He raised gobs and gobs of money for his party, just as Pelosi had done. That’s one of the duties of the modern speaker, is to be this sort of a cash cow,” Kosar said.</p>
<p>“The GOP dissidents just killed that cash cow,” Kosar added. “And I wonder inside the GOP conference, how many members are seething about that because many of them are heavily reliant on the speaker to raise money for them.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Dissident Republicans in the U.S. House voted with Democrats on Tuesday to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker, a historic move that came just nine months after he secured the gavel following days of negotiating with the GOP’s right flank and 15 rounds of voting.</p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately clear after the vote how the House would proceed in the coming days, having entered uncharted territory. No speaker has <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/HMAN-104/pdf/HMAN-104-pg142.pdf" target="_blank">ever before been removed </a>by the House. North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry was named speaker pro tem until the election of a new speaker, and he sent the House into a recess.</p>
<p>The 216-210 vote on a motion to vacate, which Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/florida-rep-matt-gaetz-files-motion-oust-mccarthy-us-house-speaker" target="_blank">filed</a> Monday evening, capped off months of growing dissent among a small group of House Republicans.</p>
<p>Republican Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Ken Buck of Colorado, Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Eli Crane of Arizona, Gaetz, Bob Good of Virginia, Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Matt Rosendale of Montana voted to remove McCarthy.</p>
<p>They also <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023518" target="_blank">voted against tabling the motion</a>, which took place just before the vote and would have stopped the process from moving forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American people need a speaker who will fight to keep the promises Republicans made to get the majority, not someone who cuts fiscally irresponsible deals that get more Democrat votes than Republican votes,&#8221; said Good in <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBobGood/status/1709288188261343327" target="_blank">a post on X Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>Warren Davidson of Ohio, Cory Mills of Florida and Victoria Spartz of Indiana voted against tabling, but for keeping McCarthy as speaker.</p>
<p>All House Democrats present voted to declare the office of the speaker vacant.</p>
<p>Immediately after the House was declared in recess, Republicans crowded McCarthy for handshakes, hugs and pats on the back.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Only three motions to vacate in history</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>So far, there have only been three instances where a motion to vacate was filed, one in March 1910, one in July 2015 and the one this month.</p>
<p>McCarthy said before the vote that he was calling Gaetz’s bluff, though he appeared to accept he would be ousted as speaker.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, if you throw a speaker out that has 99% of their conference, that kept the government open and paid the troops — I think we’re in a really bad place for how we’re going to run Congress,” McCarthy said.</p>
<p>The California Republican said he believed his support for passing a bipartisan short-term spending bill on Saturday, preventing a partial government shutdown, was the “right decision.”</p>
<p>“I stand by that decision and at the end of the day, if I have to lose my job over it, so be it,” McCarthy said. “I’ll continue to fight.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">McCarthy excoriated </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Gaetz and other hard-line conservatives have publicly rebuked McCarthy for not holding to a private deal he struck with them in January in order to secure the speakership.</p>
<p>The group of GOP lawmakers, some of whom are in the Freedom Caucus, have lamented McCarthy striking an agreement with President Joe Biden in May to avoid a default on the nation’s debt and for relying on Democratic votes to pass the short-term government spending bill.</p>
<p>Gaetz, speaking Monday on the floor, called on McCarthy to detail whether he had brokered a private deal with Biden to hold a vote on legislation that would provide additional aid to Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion. He also criticized McCarthy for reportedly adding border security to those talks.</p>

<p>“I get that a lot of folks might disagree with my perspectives on the border or Ukraine,” Gaetz said. “But could we at least agree that no matter how you feel about Ukraine or the Southern border, they each deserve the dignity of their own consideration and should not be rolled together.”</p>
<p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a “Dear Colleague” letter just before the vote announcing House Democrats would vote to vacate the chair.</p>
<p>“Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair,” Jeffries wrote.</p>
<p>The group of Republican dissenters who voted to remove McCarthy represents a small fraction of the House Republican Conference, many of whom backed McCarthy on the floor Tuesday and defended his record.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP supporters: ‘He did the right thing’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>“He’s being punished because he did the right thing on Saturday and made sure that the government didn’t shut down, and we bought more time to continue the appropriations process,” GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma told reporters.</p>
<p>Cole offered the motion to table on behalf of McCarthy.</p>
<p>Arkansas GOP Rep. Steve Womack told reporters before the vote the motion to vacate was a distraction and a “fool’s errand.”</p>
<p>Womack, who sits on the Appropriations Committee, said Republicans should focus on clearing all 12 appropriations bills before the new mid-November deadline.</p>
<p>“We just took the country to the brink of a shutdown for the purpose of what? Moving the rest of our appropriation bills,” Womack said. “We need to finish our work, and the only way to do that is to pass the rule and get these bills across the floor and move to the Senate in conference.”</p>
<p>Rep<strong>. </strong>Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told reporters Gaetz’s push for a motion to vacate showed there are “middle school grudges” against McCarthy.</p>
<p>“I think that Matt (Gaetz) is making a huge error,” Johnson said. “I think America is gonna be less well off because of his efforts. I think chaos has not served this country.”</p>

<p>Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma told reporters she was skeptical of the motivations some have stated for removing McCarthy as speaker.</p>
<p>“This isn’t about the appropriations process, and don’t be fooled. (Gaetz) wants to talk about the fact that we should have been doing our (appropriations) work in August. Look, it didn’t happen. So now is the time, and instead of focusing on that for the next 43 days, we’re going to be focusing on this,” Bice said.</p>
<p>GOP Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania told reporters that Republicans should focus on clearing legislation to fully fund the government and work on getting aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>“If we vacate the chair, the government will shut down, our credit rating will go down, interest rates will go up,” Fitzpatrick said. “Ukraine will be victimized and lose that war to Russia. That is what is at stake here.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats cheer behind closed doors</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Democrats huddled behind closed doors for nearly 90 minutes Tuesday morning to plot a path forward and allow members to speak for up to one minute about the motion to vacate. Rounds of applause and some cheering could be heard from the hallway outside the meeting.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers said after the meeting that McCarthy hadn’t built trust.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Democratic Rep. Annie Kuster told reporters the party had “unity of purpose” ahead of the vote.</p>
<p>“What has happened that all of you have witnessed and the American people have witnessed is that the current speaker has chosen to cater to a very extreme element that, in my view, it’s sort of a post-truth world,” Kuster said. “I think you can see that within his own caucus, but you can certainly see it in the way he’s treated us and the American people.”</p>
<p>Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal, a Washington state Democrat, told reporters that the House GOP could “wallow in their pigsty of incompetence and inability to govern.”</p>
<p>Jayapal said that Republican infighting about who their speaker should be was not an issue that Democrats felt the need to solve. She also noted that McCarthy has repeatedly broken trust with Democrats, making the party reluctant to help him keep the speakership.</p>
<p>“Nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy, and why should we? He has broken his commitment over and over again,” Jayapal said.</p>
<p>McCarthy, Jayapal said, has made a series of decisions that have eroded any support he would have had from Democrats. Those include his public comments following the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by pro-Trump rioters, his decision to walk away from a spending agreement he and Biden brokered earlier this year and his decision to withhold bringing a bill to the floor that would provide additional aid to Ukraine.</p>

<p>“Kevin McCarthy stood on the House floor and said one thing and then talked to Donald Trump and immediately did something else,” Jayapal said. “He has supported the insurrectionist president that enabled January 6 to happen and tried to obstruct the peaceful transfer of power.”</p>
<p>Jeffries, a New York Democrat, told reporters before the vote the party would “continue to put people over politics and to fight to make life better for everyday Americans.”</p>
<p>“From the very beginning that has been our objective and it will continue to be our sole focus,” Jeffries said. “We encourage our Republican colleagues, who claim to be more traditional, to break from the extremists.”</p>

<p>“But it is on them to join us to move the Congress and the country forward,” Jeffries said.</p>
<p>Rep. Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, told reporters after the closed-door meeting there wasn’t “a lot of goodwill in that room for Kevin McCarthy.”</p>
<p>“If you’re gonna negotiate, you have to negotiate with somebody you can trust who can actually keep their word,” Neal said. “And there’s not been a lot of evidence that Kevin McCarthy has kept his word along the way.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disputes over spending, Ukraine</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Just hours before a shutdown would have begun this weekend, Congress approved a short-term bill to fund the government until Nov. 17. The House passed the stopgap measure in a <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023513?Page=2" target="_blank">335-91</a> vote, with 90 Republicans opposing it. Senators approved the bill <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1181/vote_118_1_00247.htm#position" target="_blank">88-9</a>, with nine Republicans opposed.</p>
<p>The deal didn’t include additional funding for Ukraine, though Biden said Sunday that he and McCarthy <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/next-battle-congress-over-ukraine-aid-biden-presses-house-speaker-vote" target="_blank">agreed</a> to find the votes needed to pass a supplemental package with military assistance and humanitarian relief for the war-torn country as it resists further invasion by Russia.</p>
<p>The stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown was not the only time McCarthy worked with Democrats to avert financial calamity. In May the speaker <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default" target="_blank">brokered</a> a deal with Biden to raise the debt ceiling and keep the U.S. from defaulting on its loans.</p>
<p>The deal, signed into law as the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22fiscal+responsibility+act%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1" target="_blank">Fiscal Responsibility Act</a>, included agreed-upon spending levels for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.</p>
<p>McCarthy has been <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-nears-us-house-gop-fails-pass-one-month-spending-plan" target="_blank">unable to unify</a> his far-right members around the established spending levels during this year’s appropriations process, bringing the federal government within hours of a partial shutdown.</p>
<p>House lawmakers on the far-right of the spectrum have been browbeating McCarthy since before he took the gavel.</p>
<p>McCarthy’s path to the speakership in January took 15 ballots as more than a dozen far-right conservatives blocked him during a four-day stalemate.</p>
<p>The California Republican won on the 15th ballot after <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-backs-mccarthy-speaker-after-tense-and-chaotic-late-night-session-25" target="_blank">several concessions</a> to the ultra-conservative wing of his party, including a change to the motion to vacate that will allow any one member to essentially call for a no-confidence vote on the speaker.</p>
<p>McCarthy also reserved spots on key committees for far-right members and entered a handshake deal with members of the House Freedom Caucus, promising to cut spending levels.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Congress approved a bill Saturday night that would stave off a government shutdown until at least mid-November, though the measure doesn’t include Ukraine aid backed by both Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>The bipartisan 88-9 vote in the U.S. Senate, just hours before a midnight deadline, took place after the U.S. House earlier in the day <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023513?Page=2" target="_blank">voted 335-91</a> to approve the legislation, with the support of members of both parties. President Joe Biden signed it into law late Saturday night.</p>
<p>Republican senators voting no included Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Mike Braun of Indiana, Ted Cruz of Texas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Mike Lee of Utah, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Eric Schmitt of Missouri and J. D. Vance of Ohio.</p>
<p>Three of Virginia&#8217;s Republican representatives — Reps. Ben Cline, Bob Good and Morgan Griffith — voted against the resolution in the House. All other eight members of the state&#8217;s House delegation and both its senators voted in favor of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Continuing the bloated Pelosi spending levels and the chaos of Biden&#8217;s open border is unacceptable,&#8221; Cline wrote prior to the vote on X, the platform previously known as Twitter.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/RepBenCline/status/1708153741247971539</p>
<p>Good said in <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBobGood/status/1708196153546723406" target="_blank">a statement on X</a>: &#8220;Kevin McCarthy put a CR on the Floor that got 209 Democrat votes, since it kept in place the Biden-Pelosi-Schumer policies that are destroying the country and the spending levels that are bankrupting us. Sadly, it also got 126 Republican votes. Uni-Party rule.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia Rep. Rob Wittman (R) in a lengthy statement Saturday afternoon called the stop-gap bill &#8220;necessary to avoid the government shutdown and keep the government open&#8221; but said he was &#8220;frustrated&#8221; that Congress had not passed all 12 regular appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve continually said that members of Congress should work through August instead of taking a break for recess in order to get our funding bills passed on time,&#8221; said Wittman.</p>
<p>Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Virginia, in a statement said Congress &#8220;should never have come this close to a government shutdown.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For days, thousands of Virginians I represent feared a situation where they would be forced to work without pay, become furloughed, or struggle to make ends meet. And for months, Virginia’s businesses were sounding the alarm about the devastating effects of shutdowns on Virginia’s economy,&#8221; she said. “Many of my colleagues in the House GOP refused to listen to these voices. They were determined to bring down the very functioning of America’s government for the sake of raising money, grabbing headlines, and getting the attention they so desperately crave.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stopgap spending legislation, unveiled Saturday morning in the House, does not provide any additional funding for military relief or humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The Senate’s original short-term funding bill had included $6.1 billion, which was significantly less than the $24 billion the Biden administration <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-asks-congress-40b-ukraine-aid-us-disaster-response-border-security" target="_blank">requested</a> in August. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this month traveled<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/if-we-dont-get-aid-we-will-lose-war-zelenskyy-asks-congress-help-ukraine" target="_blank"> to Capitol Hill </a>to meet with lawmakers to reiterate the need for continued aid to support his country’s fight against the Russian invasion.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he would put a supplemental spending bill for Ukraine on the floor as soon as next week.</p>
<p>“This is a bridge CR and Leader McConnell and I have agreed to continue fighting for more economic and security aid for Ukraine,” Schumer said, using the abbreviation for a continuing resolution. “We support Ukraine’s efforts to defend its sovereignty against Putin’s aggression.”</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said he expected the Senate would approve aid for Ukraine before the end of the year.</p>
<p>“Most Senate Republicans remain committed to helping our friends on the front lines, to investing more heavily in American strength that reinforces our allies and deterring our top strategic adversary, China,” McConnell said. “I’m confident the Senate will pass further urgent assistance to Ukraine later this year.”</p>
<p>House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Whip Katherine Clark, Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar and Vice Chair Ted Lieu all called on House Republicans to put a Ukraine assistance bill up for a vote.</p>
<p>“​​When the House returns, we expect Speaker McCarthy to advance a bill to the House Floor for an up-or-down vote that supports Ukraine, consistent with his commitment to making sure that Vladimir Putin, Russia and authoritarianism are defeated,” they said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>In a statement Saturday, Virginia Rep. Don Beyer (D) said the U.S. is &#8220;unwavering in our support for [Ukraine&#8217;s] defense agains the Russian invasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are those in Congress who would deny Ukraine the assistance required to win this war, but those of us who stand with our Ukrainian allies vastly outnumber them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have defeated them before and we will again, to deliver the aid Ukraine needs and deserves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Senate Republicans announced mid-day they would not support moving ahead with the original CR that included assistance for Ukraine. McConnell has been a vocal proponent of additional military and humanitarian aid for the country.</p>
<p>The Kentucky Republican told reporters that he had instructed GOP senators to vote against advancing the Senate’s own stopgap spending bill toward final passage.</p>
<p>“It looks like there may be a bipartisan agreement coming from the House,” McConnell said. “So I’m fairly confident that most of my members, our members, are going to vote against cloture — not necessarily because they’re opposed to the underlying bill, but to see what the House can do on a bipartisan basis, and then bring it over to us.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A motion to adjourn, a fire alarm and a ‘magic minute’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>House passage of the continuing resolution came amid a hectic day on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Republicans began the morning huddling in a basement room of the Capitol to plot a path ahead, after <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-nears-us-house-gop-fails-pass-one-month-spending-plan" target="_blank">failing to pass a separate stopgap spending </a>bill Friday.</p>
<p>GOP leaders then brought the floor into session, giving just 40 minutes for debate on a new stopgap spending bill and infuriating Democrats, who argued they hadn’t been given time to read the 71-page measure.</p>
<p>“We have had 15 minutes to review a 71-page document,” House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro said. “A document that was filed before midnight last night. There hasn’t been any time for staff to review a 71-page document on such an important issue.”</p>
<p>House Democratic Whip Katherine Clark, of Massachusetts, got more time for lawmakers to read the legislation before the House took the final vote by making a motion to adjourn.</p>
<p>Democrats were able to extend what should have been a 15-minute vote by waiting until it was almost over, then lining up on the House floor to vote on paper cards one-by-one, instead of electronically with their voting cards.</p>
<p>The final vote, which took about an hour, rejected the motion to adjourn 0-427 after Democrats voted with Republicans to stay in session.</p>
<p>“We have just received a 71-page bill that is about keeping open our federal government, something the Democrats have been pushing for months,” Clark said before the vote began. “We are asking for 90 minutes to be able to read this bill and come to the floor with an informed vote. That has been denied. We have serious trust issues, so at this point in time, I am making a motion to adjourn.”</p>
<p>Adding to the feeling of chaos, New York Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman pulled a fire alarm in one of the House office buildings around noon as the vote on the motion to adjourn was beginning, causing the alarm to go off and for the building to be evacuated. The U.S. Capitol Police weren’t able to clear the building for reopening until more than an hour later.</p>
<p>His chief of staff said in a written statement <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahIddrissu/status/1708194899592425876" target="_blank">posted to X</a> that “Congressman Bowman did not realize he would trigger a building alarm as he was rushing to make an urgent vote. The Congressman regrets any confusion.”</p>
<p>After the vote on adjourning wrapped up, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, delivered a so-called “magic minute” floor speech. As a member of leadership he can speak as long as he wants and it only subtracts one minute from Democrats’ total debate time.</p>
<p>The tactic has been used by both Democratic and Republican leaders to bring attention to an issue or to delay a final vote. Slowing down the vote on Saturday was intended to give Democrats more time to read the bill and appeared to also give congressional leaders time to determine how to move forward on the new continuing resolution.</p>
<p>The speech lasted about an hour, after which the House debated the legislation a bit longer, before sending it over to their Senate colleagues with just hours to go.</p>
<p>Far-right members of the House Republican Conference have been threatening to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy if he relied on Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill. But none of those members brought up the so-called motion to vacate on Saturday. The House after its vote adjourned until Monday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disaster relief, FAA extension</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Senators had been slowly advancing their own bipartisan spending bill since <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-moves-short-term-spending-bill-struggle-avoid-shutdown-days-away" target="_blank">releasing it Tuesday</a>, though without the agreement of all 100 lawmakers in that chamber, the bill wouldn’t have become law before the Saturday midnight deadline.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20230925/CR.pdf" target="_blank">71-page stopgap bill</a> in the House released Saturday would fund the government through Friday, Nov. 17 and extend the authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration through Dec. 31.</p>
<p>It would provide $16 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s disaster relief fund, the primary account for disaster relief and response. Wildland firefighters would not see a pay cut that was scheduled to begin on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>House Appropriations Chair Kay Granger, a Texas Republican, urged support for the legislation, saying during floor debate that while “a continuing resolution is not ideal, it prevents a harmful government shutdown.”</p>
<p>“It gives us more time to pass the appropriations bills on the floor of the House and allows us to start negotiations on final, full-year bills with the Senate,” Granger said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pay raise argument</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, sharply criticized House Republicans for not adding a provision to the bill that bars members of Congress from getting a cost of living increase, calling it a pay raise.</p>
<p>“The Senate bill includes the blocking or prohibition on a member pay raise. That has been dropped from the bill that has just been proposed,” DeLauro said.</p>
<p>Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, chairman of the panel that funds Congress, said that was an incorrect reading of the legislation. But he later said the bill could be amended to include a paragraph explicitly prohibiting a cost-of-living adjustment for members of Congress.</p>
<p>“I guess, being generous here, out of an abundance of caution and respect for those bill-drafting experts in the Senate, fixing that to include the Senate’s genius language in this measure is something that’s imminently doable in short order,” he said.</p>
<p>The change was quickly agreed to on the House floor without any vote.</p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — A sweeping government shutdown appeared inevitable on Friday, with the U.S. Senate stuck in a procedural holding pattern on its bipartisan stopgap bill and divided U.S. House Republicans unable to pass their short-term spending bill.</p>
<p>Both chambers of Congress must approve and President Joe Biden must sign government funding legislation before midnight on Saturday, otherwise a funding lapse would begin on Oct. 1.</p>
<p>But mid-afternoon Friday, a month-long funding <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-118hr5525ih/pdf/BILLS-118hr5525ih.pdf" target="_blank">bill</a> packed with steep spending cuts drafted by some of the more conservative members of the House GOP <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2023511?Page=2" target="_blank">failed</a> to pass, 198-232. Twenty-one Republican members opposed it. The measure would have had no future in the Democratic-controlled Senate.</p>
<p>House leaders following that vote announced they will be in session and voting on Saturday, though on what was not immediately clear ahead of a GOP conference meeting in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>The mood lagged in the U.S. Capitol on Friday, where workers and law enforcement chatted in the hallways and cafeterias about the prospect of working without pay.</p>

<p>More than 3.5 million federal employees <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/disaster-nears-millions-federal-workers-paychecks-would-be-hold-shutdown" target="_blank">would either work without pay or be furloughed</a> if the government shuts down. Federal employees would receive back pay after the shutdown ends, though that provision has not extended to federal contractors in the past.</p>
<p>U.S. troops, roughly 1.3 million people, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/active-duty-military-would-work-without-pay-shutdown-white-house-warns" target="_blank">would be required to work without pay </a>until the shutdown ends.</p>
<p>A partial government shutdown wouldn’t have broad impacts on so-called mandatory spending programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, because those accounts are not predominantly funded through the annual appropriations process.</p>
<p>A shutdown would have varying effects on the dozens of departments and agencies that do rely on Congress to approve new spending bills each year.</p>
<p>Those include the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs. Almost all services for veterans would continue, however.</p>
<p>Other activities were affected as well by the looming shutdown — former President Jimmy Carter’s 99th birthday party at the Carter Center in Atlanta was <a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/09/29/with-shutdown-looming-celebration-for-jimmy-carters-99th-birthday-starts-early/" target="_blank">moved up </a>to Saturday instead of Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Border security and spending cuts</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During debate on the failed GOP bill, Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan said the legislation would fund the government, cut spending and “secure the border.” GOP lawmakers attached a border security bill they passed earlier this year to the short-term funding bill.</p>
<p>“Three simple, common sense things, but the most important of those three is … the border situation,” Jordan said.</p>
<p>Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the stopgap spending bill would be a “gift basket to far-right extremists” that will “slingshot” the federal government into a shutdown.</p>
<p>“The gutting cuts in this bill do not continue current funding like we’ve historically done in continuing resolutions,” she said. “Instead, this so-called CR slashes cancer and Alzheimer’s research, defunds the police, undercuts allies like Israel and Ukraine.”</p>
<p>House Republicans’ stopgap spending bill would have cut funding below current levels, resulting in billions less available for federal departments and agencies. The departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs would have been exempted from those cuts.</p>

<p>White House budget director Shalanda Young argued during a Friday briefing that Speaker Kevin McCarthy should stick to the spending deal <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default" target="_blank">he and the president brokered </a>in May.</p>
<p>“The speaker wanted to set toplines, we set them,” Young said.</p>
<p>Young criticized House Republicans for not agreeing to the Senate stopgap bill that would last through Nov. 17 to give lawmakers more time to come to an agreement to pass the 12 appropriations bills into law.</p>
<p>“This is not hard,” Young said. “It is not meant to come back and negotiate and redo things we just agreed to do three months ago. It is to keep the government open to give congressional negotiators more time on long-term bills.”</p>
<p>McCarthy, a California Republican, said during a press conference before the House vote that he would likely keep trying to pass a short-term funding bill ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline.</p>
<p>“You have watched me time and again — have you ever known me to quit after one time if it doesn’t succeed?” McCarthy said. “I don’t stop.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Senate working on stopgap</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Senate <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-moves-short-term-spending-bill-struggle-avoid-shutdown-days-away" target="_blank">released a broadly bipartisan stopgap spending bill</a> earlier this week and has since taken two procedural votes to advance the measure.</p>
<p>But that chamber’s rules don’t allow the Senate to vote on final passage before the Saturday midnight deadline without the consent of all 100 lawmakers.</p>
<p>Kentucky’s GOP Sen. Rand Paul has said he won’t allow a vote as long as the $6.1 billion in additional aid for Ukraine is in the legislation. But party leaders in the Senate aren’t seriously considering removing the Ukraine money.</p>
<p>And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, the senior GOP senator from Kentucky, warned against forcing a government shutdown Thursday, saying it would be “an actively harmful proposition.”</p>
<p>“Instead of producing any meaningful policy outcomes, it would actually take the important progress being made on a number of key issues and drag it backward,” McConnell said.</p>
<p>Republican senators are trying to draft an amendment to the stopgap bill that would increase spending on border security and make policy changes, a move they hope would encourage House GOP leaders to put the bill on the floor.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said Friday that everything was still “up in the air,” but that he was “hopeful” senators would work out an agreement before the deadline.</p>
<p>“I still think there’s something that can get through here before the deadline tomorrow night,” Thune said. “What exactly it looks like, I think, is still not totally resolved.”</p>
<p>Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun said following a closed-door meeting Friday afternoon that “nothing’s really coming together” because there are “too many moving parts at this stage.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t clear if there would be enough GOP support for the bipartisan Senate CR to move past a procedural hurdle Saturday that requires at least 60 votes, Braun said.</p>
<p>“It looks like probably what’s going to have to happen is something with clarity is going to have to come out of the House,” Braun said. “And I don’t know what that would be, because there was a vote that just didn’t work.”</p>
<p>The stalemate, he said, is at the “worst point” since he’s been a senator.</p>
<p>Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt said senators want to make sure whatever they vote on is “compatible” with their House Republican colleagues.</p>
<p>“So we’ll see what they come up with in the morning. In the meantime, we’re going to continue to work on these measures,” Britt said. “We want to be prepared.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veterans health, WIC, SNAP, parks</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Among agencies, the Department of Veterans Affairs would be largely exempt from the impacts since the VA is funded in advance, a rare exception to how Congress typically handles federal funding for so-called discretionary programs, which make up about one-third of annual federal spending.</p>
<p>The VA says that about 15,620 of its 450,000 employees would be furloughed during a shutdown and several of its programs would be put on hold, including the education call center or GI Bill hotline, career outreach and permanent headstone installations at veterans’ cemeteries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-wont-affect-health-care-or-most-benefits-veterans-va-says" target="_blank">Veterans would continue receiving</a> health care as well as education and pension benefits.</p>
<p>Almost 7 million people within the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also called WIC, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/food-benefits-low-income-families-risk-government-shutdown" target="_blank">could lose access to the program</a> during a partial government shutdown.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="o0rTp58c4g"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/25/food-benefits-for-low-income-families-at-risk-in-a-government-shutdown-white-house-says/">Over 127K Virginians could lose WIC benefits in government shutdown, White House says</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Over 127K Virginians could lose WIC benefits in government shutdown, White House says&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/25/food-benefits-for-low-income-families-at-risk-in-a-government-shutdown-white-house-says/embed/#?secret=6JzGeXXKYb#?secret=o0rTp58c4g" data-secret="o0rTp58c4g" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said Monday that the “vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and elimination of those benefits, which means the nutrition assistance that’s provided would not be available.”</p>
<p>Vilsack, a former Iowa governor, said that the USDA has a contingency fund for WIC, but that it would only last a day or two.</p>
<p>He added that another nutrition program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, has enough funding to last the month of October in the event of a government shutdown. There are about 40 million low-income people who rely on SNAP.</p>
<p>“Now, if the shutdown were to extend longer than that, there would be some serious consequences to SNAP,” Vilsack also said on Monday.</p>
<p>Vilsack added that amid a partial government shutdown, it will be <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/09/27/the-farm-bill-is-on-the-verge-of-expiring-congress-is-months-away-from-a-new-version/" target="_blank">nearly impossible for Congress to pass a new farm bill.</a> Every five years, lawmakers must write a sweeping farm bill to set policy and funding levels for farm, food, nutrition and conservation programs.</p>
<p>This year’s farm bill is set to expire Sept. 30, but lawmakers typically finish it by the end of the year. The 2018 farm bill was signed into law in December of that year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nearly-all-national-park-sites-close-during-government-shutdown" target="_blank">National Park officials would need to close off access</a> to most of the country’s 425 parks, recreation areas and national historic sites during a shutdown.</p>

<p>The IRS would continue processing certain payments, maintaining its computer networks and printing and designing tax forms for the upcoming year. However, some taxpayer services will <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/266/IRS-FY24LapsePlan.pdf" target="_blank">cease</a> during the non-filing season. Call sites that respond to taxpayer questions will be closed during a funding lapse.</p>
<p>Several sources of federal aid to states will also be affected, Tim Storey, the CEO of the National Conference of State Legislatures, said in a written statement Friday.</p>
<p>“A shutdown creates uncertainty for states and impedes access to vital federal programs,” Storey said. “While states may not feel the immediate effects, critical state services that receive federal funding such as (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), disaster relief efforts, cybersecurity and child nutrition may be put in jeopardy if Congress does not come to an agreement quickly.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Road projects on track</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Most federal funding for highways and transit, including the daily reimbursements to state departments of transportation and transit agencies, will continue without interruption.</p>
<p>Those programs are funded through the Highway Trust Fund, not annual appropriations. The trust fund was reauthorized in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The law also provided five years of advanced appropriations for highway and transit spending, meaning that the workers at the U.S. Department of Transportation who process those payments can remain at work with pay through a partial shutdown.</p>
<p>That means federal money for construction of roads, bridges and transit would continue to flow to state coffers.</p>
<p>“If it’s a highway or mass transit project everybody should be at work and fully funded and able to do all of the things on Oct. 2 that they were able to do on Sept. 29,” Jeff Davis, a senior fellow at the national transportation think tank Eno Center for Transportation, said on a Friday webinar.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Air turbulence ahead</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Air travel, meanwhile, could see disruptions.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers, considered essential to protect life and safety, would be required to work without pay.</p>
<p>Federal employees were <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/2023_GSA_Payroll_Calendar-R1pdf.pdf" target="_blank">scheduled</a> to receive a regular paycheck Friday, before a potential partial shutdown. The first paycheck they miss would be Oct. 13, if the partial shutdown is still ongoing then.</p>
<p>If a funding lapse persists that long, the air traffic controllers could begin work slowdowns, leading to air travel delays and cancellations.</p>
<p>Air traffic controllers are forbidden by law from striking, but the last partial shutdown saw several <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/06/politics/ten-air-traffic-controllers-shutdown/index.html" target="_blank">call in sick</a> rather than work without pay.</p>

<p>“Imagine the pressure that a controller is already under every time they take their position at work,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said at a Sept. 27 news conference. “And then imagine the added stress of coming to that job from a household with a family that can no longer count on that paycheck.”</p>
<p>In addition to hurting morale in the short-term, a shutdown would ruin training programs for air traffic controllers, Buttigieg said.</p>
<p>“We would immediately have to stop training new air traffic controllers and furlough another 1,000 controllers who are already in the training pipeline,” he said. “The complexity of the hiring and training process means even a shutdown lasting a few days could mean we will not hit our staffing and hiring targets next year.”</p>
<p>Other employees that would be required to work during the partial government shutdown include those in the Transportation Security Administration under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>Of the nearly 61,000 TSA employees, the agency expects nearly 58,000 to continue security checks across the nation’s airports.</p>
<p>In addition to funding lapses for most federal programs, the authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration expires at midnight Saturday, meaning that the trust funds that operate outside the normal appropriations process could not fund operations as they do for highways.</p>
<p>Even a short-term funding bill without an FAA extension is in practice the same as not having a short-term bill, Davis said.</p>
<p>“The budget authority is not available because the underlying trust fund from which it’s drawn doesn’t exist at the moment,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Parks to shutter</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Almost all National Park Service sites that they are physically able to block access to <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/nearly-all-national-park-sites-close-during-government-shutdown" target="_blank">would close</a>.</p>
<p>“At NPS sites across the country, gates will be locked, visitor centers will be closed, and thousands of park rangers will be furloughed,” the Interior Department, which oversees the NPS, <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/government-shutdown-will-close-americas-national-parks-impede-visitor-access" target="_blank">said Friday</a>.</p>
<p>States and nonprofit groups can work with the federal government to fund park operations. The governors of Arizona and Utah have said they will seek such agreements this year. But even those sites may see a disruption in access as agreements are finalized and funding is secured.</p>
<p>Mount Rushmore National Monument in South Dakota, for example, was closed for the first three days of the 16-day shutdown in 2013. After a blizzard, the park reopened for the last three days of the shutdown with the help of nonprofit donations and an agreement with South Dakota’s state government, Cheryl Schreier, the former Mount Rushmore superintendent, said in a Friday interview.</p>
<p>Park sites stayed open with a minimal workforce during the 2018-2019 shutdown. U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources ranking Republican John Barrasso of Wyoming called for the Interior Department to do the same this year and criticized the decision to close parks.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration has the ability to keep our nation’s parks open and accessible,” he said in a statement. “Instead, they’re deliberately trying to make a government shutdown as painful as possible for American families and visitors alike.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_34277" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34277" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_8209-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Hikers in Shenandoah National Park. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p>But the Government Accountability Office said the decision to keep parks open during the shutdown <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-330776.pdf" target="_blank">was illegal</a>. And park advocates have said remaining open without enough workers created problems.</p>
<p>Visitors to Mount Rushmore during the 2018-2019 shutdown “were very confused,” Schreier said. Trash and even human waste piled up as visitors couldn’t find open bathrooms.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials, not visitor services employees, comprised most of the workforce.</p>
<p>“It makes it difficult when you don’t have, obviously, the adequate staff,” Schreier said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Historic, cultural sites to close</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Public tours of the U.S. Capitol will cease, as the Congressional Visitor Center would close down during a funding lapse. This includes tours of the complex’s storied dome.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police will continue to report to work to secure the complex, but they will do so without pay.</p>
<p>“I’ve sent my membership updates to prepare for a shutdown if it happens, which it looks like it will,” said Gus Papathanasiou, chairman of the USCP Labor Committee. “I’m hoping a shutdown doesn’t happen because with the cost of living higher than ever, this shutdown will create an enormous hardship.”</p>
<p>Workers with the Architect of the Capitol, the office charged with maintaining the Capitol buildings and grounds, will continue to work in a limited capacity without pay.</p>
<p>USCP officers and Capitol maintenance staff will receive back pay upon the end of a shutdown.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo will remain open until at least Oct. 7, even if a partial government shutdown is triggered this weekend, according to the institution’s contingency <a href="https://www.si.edu/sites/default/files/about/smithsonian-federal-lapse-plan.pdf" target="_blank">plan</a> released Thursday.</p>
<p>The institution, which employs nearly 4,000 across its several locations, will continue to use fund balances from prior years until they are exhausted.</p>
<p>Just over 1,100 Smithsonian workers will remain on the job during the shutdown to care for animals, continue lab experiments, maintain library archives and secure the facilities.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Student loan repayments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Federal student loan repayment officially begins Oct. 1, and regardless of a shutdown, those payments are still due.</p>
<p>“Even if extreme House Republicans needlessly shut down the government, loan payments will continue to be due starting this month,” a spokesperson from the Department of Education said in a statement to States Newsroom.</p>
<p>The Biden administration did <a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2023/08/28/heres-what-to-know-about-new-federal-policies-for-repaying-student-loans/" target="_blank">launch a one-year on-ramp program </a>where borrowers with federal student loans won’t be faulted for not repaying their loans. However, interest will still accrue.</p>
<p>Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, in a <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/shutdown/contingency-plan-2021.pdf" target="_blank">contingency plan</a>, said the department would furlough 90% of its staff. There are about 4,000 full-time and part-time employees.</p>
<p>Programs that would still run because they are mandatory include Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student Loans.</p>
<p>Some programs that would lapse include the development and awarding of grants. The Office for Civil Rights would pause its reviews and investigations and guidance and regulatory actions.</p>

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — More than 3.5 million federal employees and military personnel — many in the Washington, D.C., area but also scattered across the states and around the globe — are bracing for another partial government shutdown, as U.S. House Republicans struggle to produce a short-term plan to fund the government past the end of the month.</p>
<p>Most of the workers will be furloughed and go without paychecks in a shutdown. Some, like members of the military, law enforcement officers, air traffic controllers and TSA officers, will have to work without pay because of the nature of their jobs. Those federal employees would get back pay once the shutdown ends under a law enacted in January 2019.</p>
<p>Lawmakers would not be personally affected — members of Congress would continue to get paid, as well as President Joe Biden and federal judges, though the judicial branch could see its funding run low.</p>
<p>In the D.C. area, Virginia is home to over 140,000 civilian federal workers, who for some unknown period would go without pay and would be forced to draw on savings or other assistance, according to a federal employee database. Maryland has an estimated 139,000 civilian employees.</p>
<p>The economic impact could be broad, because the funding lapse this year would hit much harder than the 35-day partial government shutdown that took place during the Trump administration and reduced gross domestic product by billions of dollars. This time, a partial shutdown would affect more than 1.4 million uniformed members of the military and 1 million additional civilian federal employees at the Pentagon, Department of Health and Human Services and several other agencies, as well as congressional staff.</p>
<p>Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has repeatedly warned his own members against forcing a funding lapse, saying it won’t help the party to achieve its goals.</p>
<p>But that hasn’t stopped especially conservative Republicans from<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-spending-bills-falter-congress-struggles-avoid-shutdown" target="_blank"> halting work </a>on full-year spending measures and opposing the short-term stopgap bill that’s needed to give lawmakers more time to work out a deal.</p>
<p>American Federation of Government Employees National President Everett Kelley said in a written statement that a “government shutdown would be a disaster for the American people and the federal employees who keep our government running.”</p>
<p>“Shutdowns hurt local communities across the country, deny Americans access to government services, and do significant damage to the overall economy,” Kelley said.</p>
<p>Congress, Kelley said, “needs to do its job and pass a continuing resolution to keep the government funded at current levels while continuing to negotiate a final budget. Nothing less is acceptable.”</p>
<p>AFGE represents more than 750,000 federal and D.C. government employees.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at why the federal government might shut down by Oct. 1, what agencies are impacted and what isn’t affected.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why would the government have to shut down?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Congress is supposed to pass 12 government funding bills each year before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, but lawmakers haven’t completed all of their bills on time since 1996.</p>
<p>Instead, every year the House and Senate pass at least one stopgap spending bill, or continuing resolution. This keeps funding levels and policy mostly flat for a few weeks or a couple of months, giving the appropriations committees more time to work out bipartisan bills and for leaders to hold floor votes.</p>
<p>Congress sometimes has to pass several short-term funding bills lasting for months, or even the entire fiscal year, if agreements on new full-year spending bills can’t be negotiated.</p>
<p>If Congress doesn’t approve all dozen full-year government funding bills or pass a short-term stopgap bill by midnight on Sept. 30, then a funding lapse begins and government departments begin implementing a partial shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What happens during a shutdown? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Federal civilian employees are broadly categorized as either “excepted” or “non-excepted.” During a partial government shutdown, excepted federal workers continue to work without pay while everyone else is furloughed — which means they are on an enforced vacation and their pay is on hold until the government resumes operations.</p>
<p>Employees that deal with “the safety of human life or the protection of property” often work without pay until Congress approves some sort of spending measure.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What federal departments and agencies are involved?</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p>Any federal department or agency without a full-year appropriations bill would need to implement its shutdown plans if Congress doesn’t approve a spending bill before Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Congress has yet to pass any of its dozen annual funding bills for fiscal 2024, so all of the departments and agencies funded through the annual appropriations process would be impacted.</p>
<p>That includes the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury and Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>Smaller federal agencies would also be affected, including the Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration, NASA and the Smithsonian Institution, among dozens of others.</p>
<p>The entire legislative branch, including the U.S. House, U.S. Senate, Capitol Police, Congressional Budget Office, Government Accountability Office and Library of Congress, among others, would be partially shut down.</p>
<p>Each department and agency has its own guidance for implementing a partial government shutdown, which is <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/information-for-agencies/agency-contingency-plans/" target="_blank">posted on the Office of Management and Budget’s website.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What federal operations escape?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Spending on mandatory programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security does not go through the annual appropriations process, so those three programs are mostly exempt from the impact.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How many federal employees would be furloughed?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The federal government employed just under 2.2 million civilian employees earlier this year, according to its <a href="https://www.fedscope.opm.gov/" target="_blank">database</a>. There are another 1.4 million members of the U.S. military, according to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/spec_fy2024.pdf" target="_blank">numbers</a> from the Office of Management and Budget. The legislative branch employs more than 31,000 employees, and the judicial branch has about 33,000 employees.</p>
<p>About 745,000 of the civilian employees work for the Department of Defense, with another 449,000 at the Veterans Affairs Department. The Department of Homeland Security — which houses Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency — employs more than 216,000 federal employees.</p>
<p>A state-by-state <a href="https://www.fedscope.opm.gov/ibmcognos/bi/v1/disp?b_action=powerPlayService&amp;m_encoding=UTF-8&amp;BZ=1AAABlrQKB6l42n1OTW_CQBT8M%7EuwPdS8HUDlwGGBJZJUsMK9obhaUz4McvHfN8DBtofO5CWTeTPJWHm2zIvsoJPIvw1db5LoiYALPNdVCJ2NRuyESnuOXLEbePFKOnKNNQHP1tjV6hBu96rY_oS46trBtAMhPnX10fTkBuRwWzaG7GixL6uv8mxu77q51t29Me2wIDcixNf58zv_SBH4hcC7sq8_CQyGPRatKA_XYZamOiySLE3VTvv%7ElqzgzT8xC8nMUrIQgoXLAixGCqHOpq3uBCYcCazqmth77apyuHTtH1sQNgSbCUYSPgjebMiHISYQ7DH_A3LipOYx080TZnwDkntmsg%3D%3D" target="_blank">breakdown</a> of where civilian federal employees work shows that the nation’s capital has the most federal employees, with 161,000 working in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>California has the second-highest population of civilian federal employees, with 142,000. Texas holds nearly 123,000.</p>
<p>More than 636,000 federal employees are veterans.</p>
<p>Federal employees will get back pay after the shutdown ends, though that hasn’t extended to federal contractors.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Does anyone get paid during a partial government shutdown?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The president, members of Congress and judges.</p>
<p>Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution “forbids the salary of the President to be reduced while he or she is in office, thus effectively guaranteeing the President of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,” according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>Members of Congress would receive pay for several reasons, including that they have a permanent appropriation for their salaries, a section of the Constitution addressing lawmakers’ pay and the 27th Amendment, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution says that U.S. lawmakers “shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.”</p>
<p>And the 27th Amendment notes that “no law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.”</p>
<p>Judges and the judiciary would “likely be able to continue to operate for a limited time using funds derived from court filings and other fees and from no-year appropriations,” according to a <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/RL34680.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from CRS.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How many funding lapses have there been?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Congress has failed to fund the government three times since 2000.</p>
<p>In 2013, there was a 16-day shutdown amid calls from several hardline Republicans, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, to defund the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.</p>
<p>While none of the 12 full-year government funding bills were law when that shutdown began, it didn’t fully impact the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Just before the funding lapse began, Congress passed a bill to provide pay for troops, Defense Department civilian employees and certain contractors working for either the Defense Department or the Homeland Security Department, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>There were two funding lapses during the Trump administration, one of which was relatively short and one that lasted for 35 days.</p>
<p>The 35-day partial government shutdown began after five of the dozen annual spending bills became law, reducing the number of federal employees and operations impacted.</p>
<p>The Departments of Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Labor and Veterans Affairs weren’t affected. Congress also wasn’t impacted, having passed its own funding bill.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is the economic impact of a partial government shutdown?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Federal employees were furloughed for a total of 6.6 million days during the 2013 partial government shutdown, bringing the total “lost productivity” to about $2 billion, according to an <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/reports/impacts-and-costs-of-october-2013-federal-government-shutdown-report.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> from the White House budget office.</p>
<p>The 2019 partial government shutdown reduced real gross domestic product by $3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2018 and by $8 billion during the first quarter of 2019, according to <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-01/54937-PartialShutdownEffects.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.</p>
<p>That shutdown, CBO said in its report, “dampened economic activity mainly because of the loss of furloughed federal workers’ contribution to GDP, the delay in federal spending on goods and services, and the reduction in aggregate demand (which thereby dampened private-sector activity).”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What’s the Biden administration saying?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The White House released a memo Wednesday rebuking House Republicans for approaching the end of the fiscal year without a bipartisan plan to fund the government.</p>
<p>The administration said it’s clear that “if extreme House Republicans fail to ram through their radical agenda, they plan to take their frustration out on the American people by forcing a government shutdown that would undermine our economy and national security, create needless uncertainty for families and businesses, and have damaging consequences across the country.”</p>
<p>The memo says a funding lapse could affect dozens of federal programs, including eliminating some spaces in Head Start, slowing down new loans at the Small Business Administration and forcing the FDA to “delay food safety inspections for a wide variety of products all across the country.”</p>
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, could have to reduce the number of inspections, “denying workers a key protection against safety risk, and Americans who are owed back pay for their hard work would face delays due to the majority of Department of Labor investigations being suspended.”</p>
<p>Air travel could also be impacted since TSA employees and air traffic controllers would be working without pay, the White House memo says.</p>
<p>“These consequences are real and avoidable — but only if House Republicans stop playing political games with peoples’ lives and catering to the ideological demands of their most extreme, far-right members,” the White House memo says. “It’s time for House Republicans to abide by the bipartisan budget agreement that a majority of them voted for, keep the government open, and address other urgent needs for the American people.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved the latest round of COVID-19 boosters, as public health officials brace for another cold and flu season.</p>
<p>An advisory panel at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is scheduled to vote on recommendations Tuesday, the final step in the process before people will be able to get the shots.</p>
<p>“Vaccination remains critical to public health and continued protection against serious consequences of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death,” said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.</p>
<p>“The public can be assured that these updated vaccines have met the agency’s rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality,” Marks added. “We very much encourage those who are eligible to consider getting vaccinated.”</p>
<p>The updated COVID-19 booster shots are made by Moderna and Pfizer.</p>
<p>The FDA said in a statement that people 5 and older can get one dose of the updated mRNA COVID-19 vaccine as long as it’s been at least two months since their last dose of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Vaccinated children between six months and 4 years old can get one or two doses of the updated vaccine. Unvaccinated children in the same age range are eligible for three doses of the updated Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or two doses of the updated Moderna shot.</p>
<p>“The updated vaccines are expected to provide good protection against COVID-19 from the currently circulating variants,” the FDA said in a statement. “Barring the emergence of a markedly more virulent variant, the FDA anticipates that the composition of COVID-19 vaccines may need to be updated annually, as is done for the seasonal influenza vaccine.”</p>
<p>Hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have been trending upward in recent weeks, though officials aren’t expressing alarm at the rise in severe illness.</p>
<p>The number of hospitalizations has risen by nearly 16% while deaths increased by almost 11%, according to <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home" target="_blank">data</a> from the CDC.</p>
<p>The percentage of Americans getting COVID-19 shots has steadily decreased since the first round of vaccinations rolled out in the last weeks of 2020.</p>
<p>More than 81% of the country got at least one dose of the original vaccine, but 70% completed the primary two-dose series. Just 17% of the U.S. population decided to get the bivalent vaccine that was approved last year, according to CDC <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccination-states-jurisdictions" target="_blank">data</a>.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The debt limit law Congress approved earlier this year included a much-publicized provision that would cut all federal spending by 1% if Republicans and Democrats fail to reach agreement on the dozen government funding bills before Jan. 1.</p>
<p>That sounds pretty threatening. But the across-the-board automatic spending cut wouldn’t actually have any real-world effects until April 30, and it will never go into effect if Congress can pass its appropriations bills before that date.</p>
<p>Another quirk in the provision is that if those spending cuts were to take effect, the amount of funding for nondefense programs during the next fiscal year would actually increase compared to the spending level included in the debt limit law.</p>
<p>In other words, domestic spending would get a boost compared to what it’s supposed to be if Congress can’t do its job and pass its spending bills by next spring.</p>
<p>“There’s some weird incentives and disincentives here,” said Bill Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center.</p>
<p>Hoagland spent more than 30 years of his career working for the federal government, including as director of budget and appropriations for former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican, and as director of the Senate Budget Committee.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Details of how the cut would work</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The funding level for defense programs would move from the $886 billion the debt limit law sets for fiscal 2024 to about $850 billion, if Congress triggers that spending cut in late April.</p>
<p>That means the Pentagon would get hit with a budget reduction.</p>
<p>But, Hoagland noted, spending on nondefense programs would go from the $704 billion spending level set in the debt limit law to $736 billion because the 1% across-the-board cut is determined by current funding levels.</p>
<p>So nondefense programs — think of everything from the Transportation Security Administration to national parks to assistance for vulnerable families — actually could see their budgets increased compared to the level set in the debt limit law.</p>
<p>Congress provided $858 billion in defense and $744 billion in nondefense spending for the current fiscal year slated to end on Sept. 30 when it approved an omnibus funding package in December. The 1% cut would be taken from each of those totals.</p>
<p>“So there are some strange disincentives here when you get more than would be in the agreement … if you didn’t get your work done by next year,” Hoagland said.</p>
<p>Another provision in the law says that if Congress approves several, but not all, of its dozen annual spending bills, the cut would still be triggered for all discretionary accounts.</p>
<p>Hoagland said he’s not entirely sure the negotiators who included the 1% provision in the debt limit law thought about a scenario where Congress approves several of the 12 bills, but not all by the April 30 deadline.</p>
<p>“Boy, I don’t think that was in any way, shape, or form what the people who constructed this thought would happen, but that’s a possibility,” Hoagland said.</p>
<p>If Congress does trigger the 1% provision, Hoagland said, he expects that it would require each account that exists within federal departments and agencies to take the 1% spending cut compared to current funding levels. There are more than 2,300 accounts, he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Skepticism cut will kick in</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>David Wessel, a senior fellow in Economic Studies at Brookings and director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, said he doesn’t expect the 1% provision will ever take effect.</p>
<p>“That’s the problem with these provisions — Congress says ‘We’re going to take the tough medicine,’ except when we get close to the date when the dosage is going to be administered, they don’t,” Wessel said.</p>
<p>This provision, he said, seems like an attempt to keep the wheels of the annual appropriations process turning while encouraging a House-Senate compromise sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>“It’s very tough to write these provisions because if you write them so they’re mild, nobody cares. And if you write them so they’re tough … they go away,” he said. “So I think the people who negotiate these bills are struggling to keep the wheels of the budget process turning in a world with so much anger that a lot of people seem to be pouring sand into the gears.”</p>
<p>Philip Wallach, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said there’s no way to know just yet if the 1% provision has had any significant impact on the annual appropriations process or if it will help lawmakers to broker a bipartisan agreement in the months ahead.</p>
<p>He said some of that will depend on how Speaker Kevin McCarthy and the Freedom Caucus, a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/01/23/freedom-caucus-likely-to-play-a-bigger-role-in-new-gop-led-house-so-who-are-they/" target="_blank">group</a> of about 50 far right House Republicans, approach the end-of-the-year conference process between the House and Senate.</p>
<p>That is typically the time when the dozen spending bills become much more bipartisan so that they can pass both chambers and garner the president’s signature.</p>
<p>That group of especially conservative Republicans tend to vote against any legislation that President Joe Biden plans to sign, he said. They also consistently vote against bipartisan spending packages.</p>
<p>“That’s just been kind of a constant through this whole process. And to my mind, that very much diminishes their influence on these negotiations,” Wallach said of the Freedom Caucus.</p>
<p>The more members of the Freedom Caucus talk about the motion to vacate, the procedural maneuver that could be used to try to remove McCarthy as speaker, the more attention they could get, though that’s not guaranteed, Wallach said.</p>
<p>“I do think there’s some people that think that they’re really just going to make their play and use their motion to vacate the chair,” Wallach said. “The more we hear threats about all that, the more we can assume that’s sort of on McCarthy’s mind.”</p>
<p>“The other question is whether we could get a shutdown in trying to negotiate that dynamic between McCarthy and his right wing,” Wallach said. “It almost seems to me like some of those members want to shut down — they somehow see it as amplifying their leverage. Although I have to admit that I don’t know why they think that.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON —  A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday the abortion pill can stay on the market, but it agreed with a lower court that ultimately use should revert to prescribing and dosage instructions that were in place before 2016.</p>
<p>That appeals court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca5.213145/gov.uscourts.ca5.213145.506860229.1.pdf" target="_blank">ruling</a> will immediately be put on hold until the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether to take the case, under <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-preserves-access-abortion-pill-lawsuit-continues" target="_blank">a decision the high court released</a> in April. The ruling from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to quickly be appealed to the high court.</p>
<p>The ruling means mifepristone remains legal and on the market in states that haven’t banned it, and, due to the Supreme Court’s earlier order, can be used under modifications approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>Mifepristone was originally approved in 2000 and is the first of two drugs used in medication abortion. It is approved for use up to 10 weeks gestation and is also frequently used to treat miscarriage.</p>
<p>The Kaiser Family Foundation <a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/a-national-survey-of-obgyns-experiences-after-dobbs-report/" target="_blank">released a survey</a> in June showing that 62% of the nearly 600 OB-GYNs surveyed said they use mifepristone with a second drug called misoprostol to treat a miscarriage.</p>
<p>“Miscarriages are very common and an important aspect of many OBGYNs’ scope of practice, and sometimes involve the same procedures and medications that are used for abortions,” KFF wrote. “In early pregnancy, medical management for miscarriage with misoprostol and mifepristone allows a shorter time course than waiting for nonviable pregnancy tissue to pass on its own (expectant management) in patients without complications.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Many questions in oral arguments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The three-judge panel from the New Orleans-based appeals court that issued the ruling Wednesday <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/three-judge-panel-us-appeals-court-hears-arguments-abortion-pill-case" target="_blank">heard oral arguments</a> in the case in May after the federal government appealed a district judge’s ruling.</p>
<p>The judges had dozens of questions for the federal government’s attorney, the lawyer representing a manufacturer and the attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom, the anti-abortion legal organization that originally filed the case.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s ruling comes from that same panel, made up of Jennifer Walker Elrod, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush, as well as James C. Ho and Cory T. Wilson, who were both nominated by former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The appeals court on Wednesday disagreed with the district court judge’s ruling that the 2000 approval of mifepristone should be overturned and that the generic version of the pharmaceutical should no longer be available.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9Zyw4uEdhQ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/19/56-of-virginia-abortions-were-performed-via-medication-in-2021/">56% of Virginia abortions were performed via medication in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;56% of Virginia abortions were performed via medication in 2021&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/19/56-of-virginia-abortions-were-performed-via-medication-in-2021/embed/#?secret=InY3vJt5jz#?secret=9Zyw4uEdhQ" data-secret="9Zyw4uEdhQ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>The appeals judges agreed with the lower court’s opinion that several changes the FDA made in 2016 and 2021 regarding dosing and use of the prescription should no longer be in effect.</p>
<p>“In loosening mifepristone’s safety restrictions, FDA failed to address several important concerns about whether the drug would be safe for the women who use it,” the appeals court’s ruling states.</p>
<p>“It failed to consider the cumulative effect of removing several important safeguards at the same time. It failed to consider whether those ‘major’ and ‘interrelated’ changes might alter the risk profile, such that the agency should continue to mandate reporting of non-fatal adverse events,” the appeals judges wrote. “And it failed to gather evidence that affirmatively showed that mifepristone could be used safely without being prescribed and dispensed in person.”</p>
<p>The appeals court acknowledged in its ruling that several medical organizations filed briefs expressing concern that eliminating access to mifepristone for miscarriage management “even temporarily, may pose health risks to certain women.”</p>
<p>“These concerns are not insignificant,” the appeals court wrote. “But they apply primarily (if not wholly) to the challenge to the 2000 Approval — a claim that we have concluded is not likely to succeed.”</p>
<p>Arguments about reducing access to mifepristone by reverting to the more limited use instructions in place before 2016 “are lessened by the fact that mifepristone would remain available … as would options for surgical abortion,” the appeals court wrote.</p>
<p>Ho wrote his own opinion, saying that unlike his colleagues on the appeals court, he believed the anti-abortion organizations that filed the lawsuit likely would succeed with their challenge to the 2000 approval of mifepristone.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement it “strongly disagrees with the Fifth Circuit’s decision in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA and will be seeking Supreme Court review of that decision.”</p>
<p>“As the Attorney General has said before, the Justice Department is committed to defending the FDA’s scientific judgment and protecting Americans’ access to safe and effective reproductive care,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Limits prior to 2016</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Reverting to the pre-2016 instructions would lower when the medication can be prescribed from 10 weeks gestation to seven weeks and change dosage and timing.</p>
<p>It would mean only doctors, not qualified health care providers, could prescribe mifepristone. Patients would need to attend three in-person doctor’s office visits, eliminating the ability for the medication to be prescribed via telehealth and shipped through the mail.</p>
<p>The generic version of mifepristone could be at risk of no longer being approved, though the appeals court rejected that option in its Wednesday ruling.</p>
<p>The manufacturer of the brand name version, Mifeprex, would need to relabel the product to comply with the court’s ruling, if the Supreme Court ultimately agrees with the appeals court’s ruling. Lawyers for the company that manufactures the brand-name version have said this could take months.</p>
<p>The case began in mid-November when Alliance Defending Freedom filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas.</p>
<p>ADF, on behalf of four anti-abortion medical organizations and four anti-abortion physicians, argued the U.S. Food and Drug Administration incorrectly approved mifepristone to terminate pregnancies in 2000.</p>
<p>The lawsuit asked the district court to overturn that approval, but in the event the judge didn’t agree to do that, ADF requested the court revert prescribing and use of the medication to instructions that were in place before 2016.</p>
<p>Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk ruled to end access to mifepristone in April when <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-administration-appeals-judges-ruling-ordering-abortion-pill-us-market" target="_blank">he issued a stay</a> of the FDA’s original 2000 approval.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court placed that ruling on hold while the case works through the appeals process. That decision, which has kept mifepristone legal, would lift after the nine justices issue a ruling, or refuse to hear the case.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reactions to ruling</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>​​Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a written statement the “appeals court decision sets up a showdown at the Supreme Court over baseless attacks on medication abortion, which has been a lifeline since the high court reversed Roe last year.”</p>
<p>“This order, if allowed to take effect, could jeopardize the FDA’s entire scientific system of drug approvals and would leave patients panicked and confused about their health and safety,” Northup said.</p>
<p>Christopher M. Zahn, interim CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision “is another example of judicial activism that reflects ideology, not science.”</p>
<p>“Mifepristone is demonstrably safe and effective for its FDA-approved use up to 10 weeks of gestation, it is demonstrably safe and effective when used as directed by telemedicine, and it is demonstrably safe and effective when prescribed by qualified advanced practice clinicians,” Zahn said. “The FDA made these changes to mifepristone’s regulation for medication abortion and miscarriage management based on robust scientific data and with the support of the medical community, including ACOG.”</p>
<p>The medical organization, Zahn said, looks “forward to sharing with the Supreme Court the overwhelming evidence and consensus of the medical community in support of mifepristone for medication abortion and miscarriage management.”</p>
<p>​​Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Erin Hawley said in a written statement that the 5th Circuit’s ruling was a “significant victory for the doctors and medical associations we represent and, more importantly, the health and safety of women.”</p>
<p>“The 5th Circuit rightly required the FDA to do its job and restore crucial safeguards for women and girls, including ending illegal mail-order abortions,” Hawley added. “The FDA will finally be made to account for the damage it has caused to the health of countless women and girls and the rule of law by unlawfully removing every meaningful safeguard from the chemical abortion drug regimen.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House took a broadly bipartisan vote Wednesday night on the debt limit package, sending it to the U.S. Senate where lawmakers are expected to vote quickly to clear the measure.</p>
<p>The bill would suspend the nation’s borrowing limit through Jan. 1, 2025 and set caps on discretionary spending for two years. It would also make changes to work requirements on some federal safety net programs and overhaul aspects of the energy permitting process. The House approved the bill following a 314-117 vote.</p>

<p>While members of both political parties broadly backed the legislation, they each criticized the compromises negotiators made to broker an agreement.</p>
<p>North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, one of the Republican negotiators who brokered the deal, said the bill was the product of a “long, laborious and tough” process.</p>
<p>The measure, he said, is the “most conservative spending package” he’s voted on during his time in Congress, though he noted it’s a product of divided government where the GOP controls the House while Democrats control the Senate and White House.</p>
<p>“This rates as one of the largest deficit reduction bills in American history and it will fundamentally change the spending trajectory here in Washington — with more work to do and more work ahead,” McHenry said.</p>
<p><em>[<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/31/debt-limit-deal-hits-turbulence-in-congress-as-leaders-prep-for-vote/" target="_blank">Read more: What&#8217;s in the debt limit deal struck over the weekend</a>]</em></p>
<p>Washington Democratic Rep. Suzan DelBene said that while the “deal is far from perfect,” lawmakers “can’t let perfect be the enemy of the good when the stakes are this high.”</p>
<p>The agreement, she said, would shield veterans, senior citizens, law enforcement and schools from the more severe budget cuts that Republicans proposed in their original debt limit bill.</p>
<p>“This deal will protect American families and our economy from a devastating default on our nation&#8217;s bills in just five days,” DelBene said.</p>
<p>“Compromise means that no one gets everything they want, so we have a choice between a catastrophic outcome or a chance to move forward with a bipartisan compromise,” she added later.</p>
<p>New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell criticized Republicans for ruling out all changes to the tax code during negotiations and for rescinding some money to boost the Internal Revenue Service’s budget.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure everybody pays their fair share — what in God’s name is wrong with that,” Pascrell said.</p>
<p>If Congress doesn’t update the tax code, Pascrell said, lawmakers haven’t done their jobs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746" target="_blank">package</a> would set federal spending at $886 billion for defense and $704 billion for nondefense during the fiscal year slated to begin Oct. 1. The following year, fiscal 2025, it would cap defense spending at $895 billion for defense and $711 billion for nondefense.</p>
<p>The 100-page bill <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/debt-limit-deal-hits-turbulence-congress-leaders-prep-vote" target="_blank">holds numerous additional provisions</a>, including changes to how the federal government permits energy projects as well as language to claw back $28 billion in COVID-19 funds and about $2 billion in funding for the Internal Revenue Services.</p>
<p>The measure would make <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/new-work-requirements-some-snap-recipients-included-debt-limit-deal" target="_blank">changes to work requirements</a> for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</p>
<p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2023-05/hr3746_Letter_McCarthy.pdf" target="_blank">assessment of the legislation </a>says the package’s provisions on discretionary spending would reduce outlays by $1.332 trillion during the next decade.</p>
<p>Clawing back some of the $80 billion in funding that Democrats included for the Internal Revenue Service in their signature climate change, health care and tax package known as the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, would actually increase the deficit during the next decade, according to CBO.</p>
<p>CBO Director Phillip Swagel wrote the cut to IRS funding would decrease spending “by $1.4 billion and decrease revenues by $2.3 billion over the 2023–2033 period, resulting in a net increase in the deficit of $900 million over that period.”</p>
<p>“CBO anticipates that rescinding those funds would result in fewer enforcement actions over the next decade and in a reduction in revenue collections,” Swagel wrote.</p>
<p>Changing some work requirements and expanding eligibility for SNAP would increase federal spending by $2.1 billion while changes to TANF would reduce it by $5 million, according to CBO.</p>
<p>The section of the bill that rescinds or claws back $27.1 billion in COVID-19 budget authority would reduce federal spending outlays by $11 billion during the 10-year budget window, according to CBO.</p>
<p>The majority of those funds, CBO said, “would come from the Public Health and Social Service Emergency Fund and from certain infrastructure and disaster relief programs.”</p>
<p>The Congressional Research Service <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/98-410" target="_blank">explains</a> that budget authority “allows federal agencies to incur obligations, such as entering into contracts, employing personnel, and submitting purchase orders,” while outlays “represent the actual payment of these obligations, usually in the form of electronic transfers or checks issued by the Treasury Department.”</p>
<p>Overall, CBO said, the debt limit package would reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion during the next decade.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Wednesday morning that senators should prepare to vote quickly on the package after it arrives from the House.</p>
<p>“I cannot stress enough that we have no margin for error,” Schumer said. “Either we proceed quickly and send this bipartisan agreement to the president’s desk, or the federal government will default for the first time ever.”</p>
<p>Schumer indicated during an afternoon press conference he might not allow amendment votes that some Republicans have been calling for in order to allow the bill to move quickly to final passage.</p>
<p>“We can’t send anything back to the House. That would risk default,” Schumer said.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/treasury-secretary-pinpoints-june-5-earliest-date-us-debt-default" target="_blank">warned last week </a>that the country could begin a default on June 5 without a new debt limit law.</p>
<p>A default would prevent the federal government from borrowing any more money to pay all of the country’s bills in full and on time. That would mean delayed payments for hundreds of federal programs, including military paychecks, Social Security and Medicare. It also would negatively impact the global economy.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said once the debt limit package reaches that chamber, he’ll “be proud to support it without delay.”</p>
<p>McConnell, however, expressed disappointment with the caps on defense spending, saying it was the “worst part of the deal.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s as good as I would like,” McConnell said. “But if you look at the totality of the agreement, I think, it should be supported and our defense needs will still be there.”</p>
<p>McConnell said his hope is that if senators who want amendment votes are given those votes, they would yield back time, allowing the chamber to vote on final passage Thursday or Friday.</p>
<p>After that vote, the package will go to President Joe Biden for his signature.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Congress began moving the bipartisan debt limit package forward Tuesday, though frustrations with provisions in the bill could make for narrow passage in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>Conservative Republicans and progressive Democrats both aired their disappointment with the agreement <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-mccarthy-say-they-have-brokered-debt-limit-deal-avert-us-default" target="_blank">forged over the weekend</a>, but only GOP lawmakers are looking to possibly remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker because of the deal.</p>
<p>U.S. House Freedom Caucus Chair Scott Perry said Tuesday that conservative Republicans will do whatever they can to block the legislation, arguing the agreement “totally fails to deliver” on conservative priorities.</p>
<p>Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican, declined to directly answer questions about whether the group of about a dozen conservative lawmakers at the press conference would use the so-called motion to vacate to remove McCarthy as speaker.</p>
<p>“I am focused on defeating this bill,” Perry said. “What happens post that … we will decide once we’ve determined the disposition of this bill.”</p>
<p>Texas GOP Rep. Chip Roy said there will be a “reckoning” if the debt limit package moves forward following a floor vote, and North Carolina Rep. Dan Bishop indicated he may move for the floor vote to oust McCarthy as speaker.</p>
<p>The House is expected to vote on Wednesday around 8:30 p.m. Eastern to send the legislation to the Senate, where lawmakers need to approve the measure before Monday. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/treasury-secretary-pinpoints-june-5-earliest-date-us-debt-default" target="_blank">warned last week</a> that if the debt limit is not addressed before that date, the country would begin a default.</p>
<p>The House Rules Committee took up the bill Tuesday afternoon, a requirement for all major legislation heading to the floor. The House must vote Wednesday to approve the rule before it can move on to formally debate and vote on the bill.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Concern among progressives</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Democrats will be key to moving the bill through the Republican-controlled House, even if some of their members are not entirely happy with the outcome.</p>
<p>Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal said Tuesday the group was undergoing its whip count and determining whether to take an official position on the package.</p>
<p>Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, said the Republican Party “did not win any major concessions on spending” in the agreement but said the legislation does include some provisions she is “seriously concerned about.”</p>
<p>Jayapal said she is in talks with the White House about how exactly the handshake agreements that aren’t included in bill text would work, especially the promise that some of the funds being clawed back will be redirected to domestic spending in the annual appropriations bills.</p>
<p>She also expressed concerns about the changes to work requirements for two federal safety net programs — Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — and for energy permitting.</p>
<p>“That is a significant problem,” Jayapal said. “I’ve said before that the United States is the only industrialized country that puts these kinds of bureaucratic red tape requirements on people who are just trying to get food for their families.”</p>
<p>Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young, who had a heavy hand in negotiations, said during a White House press briefing Tuesday the deal “represents a compromise, which means no one gets everything that they want, and hard choices had to be made.”</p>
<p>Young said the agreement with House Republican leaders protects key legislative priorities of the Biden administration, such as the climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at what’s in the <a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20230529/BILLS-118hrPIH-fiscalresponsibility.pdf" target="_blank">99-page bill</a>:</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Debt limit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The bill would suspend the nation’s debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, meaning whoever wins the 2024 presidential election will likely negotiate the next agreement with that Congress.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal government spending levels</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The agreement would cap discretionary spending at $886.35 billion for defense and $703.65 billion for nondefense during fiscal 2024, set to begin Oct. 1. That’s about a 3% increase for defense and roughly flat funding for nondefense.</p>
<p>Spending levels for the following fiscal year, 2025, would be set at $895.21 billion for defense and $710.69 billion for nondefense. That would represent about a 1% boost for nondefense accounts.</p>
<p>Discretionary spending accounts for about one-third of federal spending, while mandatory spending on programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security make up the other two-thirds.</p>
<p>Nondefense accounts fund the vast majority of federal departments and agencies, including Agriculture, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs, while defense funding goes predominantly to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Some of the spending on nondefense programs would be paid for by moving around, or repurposing, unspent COVID-19 funding and part of the $80 billion Democrats approved last year for the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>In order to actually achieve those spending levels, the House, Senate and Biden administration must reach agreement on all dozen of the annual appropriations bills in the months ahead.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax code</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The deal doesn’t include any changes to the tax code, something President Joe Biden pushed for but McCarthy rejected.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Work requirements</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The legislation doesn’t alter Medicaid eligibility, but it does make changes to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Changes to all three were pushed for by Republicans.</p>
<p>TANF recipients could experience some changes to the program on Oct. 1, 2024, while others would go into place a year later on Oct. 1, 2025.</p>
<p>The program now requires states to have 50% of TANF recipients working, though states can lower that threshold based on how much their caseload has fallen since 2005, according to a White House official.</p>
<p>This legislation would set that year to 2015, give states two years to implement the changes and “allow states to do things like spending additional TANF dollars and in exchange being able to get a lower work participation rate because of that,” according to the White House official.</p>
<p>SNAP’s current work requirements for many able-bodied adults extend from age 18 through 49. This bill text says it would raise the ceiling to age 51 during the current fiscal year, to age 53 during the fiscal year slated to begin Oct. 1 and to 55 during fiscal 2025.</p>
<p>Veterans, homeless individuals and people 24 or younger who were in the foster care system when they turned 18 wouldn’t be subject to SNAP’s time limits, according to the White House.</p>
<p>The changes to SNAP would sunset on Oct. 1, 2030.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy permitting</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Members of both political parties <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/overhaul-federal-permitting-part-debt-limit-deal-not-easy-it-sounds" target="_blank">have expressed interest </a>in overhauling how the federal government permits energy projects under the National Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA.</p>
<p>NEPA requires federal agencies to consider the environmental effects of major federal actions, and the process can take years. Democrats have sought to speed construction for renewable energy projects, and Republicans have complained for years that the burdens of federal permitting restrict development.</p>
<p>The bill amends NEPA by limiting requirements on some projects and requires environmental reviews to be completed in a one- to two-year time frame.</p>
<p>Separately, the White House agreed to streamline permits for the more than <a href="https://www.mountainvalleypipeline.info/overview/" target="_blank">$6 billion Mountain Valley Pipeline</a>, a decision that has angered environmentalists and climate-conscious Democrats.</p>
<p>West Virginia Sens. Joe Manchin III, a centrist Democrat, and Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, have lobbied for the approval of the outstanding permits for the more than 300 miles of Mountain Valley Pipeline, also known as MVP, that would deliver gas from West Virginia into Virginia.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, the White House agreed to expedite permits for the long-disputed Appalachian natural gas pipeline, which has been halted due to court cases brought by environmentalists who have fought for years to prevent its construction.</p>
<p>Permits for the Mountain Valley Pipeline will be issued within 21 days after the debt ceiling bill is signed into law, according to the bill text. It also bars any judicial review of permits issued for the pipeline project by any government agency.</p>
<p>“I am pleased Speaker McCarthy and his leadership team see the tremendous value in completing the MVP to increase domestic energy production and drive down costs across America and especially in West Virginia,” Manchin, the chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources panel, said in a statement. “I am proud to have fought for this critical project and to have secured the bipartisan support necessary to get it across the finish line.”</p>
<p>The MVP has had more than 500 violations in state environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions, <a href="https://appvoices.org/resources/reports/MVP_Report_2023_AppalachianVoices.pdf" target="_blank">according to a report</a> by the environmental group Appalachian Voices.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">COVID-19 funds</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The agreement rescinds, or claws back, about $28 billion in some of the unspent federal funding that was approved during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal student loan repayment pause</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The bill would codify the end of the pause on federal student loan repayments by August and bar the administration from reinstating a pause on repayments unless approved by Congress.</p>
<p>The Biden administration<a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2022/11/27/student-loan-repayment-pause-extended-by-white-house-amid-legal-battles-over-relief-plan/" target="_blank"> announced last year</a> its plans to resume requiring repayments on student loans either after the Supreme Court’s decision on the administration’s student debt cancellation policy or 60 days after June 30.</p>
<p>A pause on student loan repayments was first enacted in 2020 by the Trump administration due to the coronavirus pandemic, and was later extended by the Biden administration.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s one-time student debt cancellation has been a target for Republicans. <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2023/05/24/biden-student-debt-relief-plan-revoked-in-u-s-house-vote/" target="_blank">Last week</a>, the House voted to overturn the policy that would cancel up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers who qualify. The Senate is expected to vote on the resolution of disapproval this week; if passed, it would block the policy. The White House has vowed to veto it.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Internal Revenue Service funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The agreement would allow Congress to pull $10 billion during fiscal 2024 and another $10 billion during fiscal 2025 from the IRS to pay for other domestic spending initiatives, according to the White House.</p>
<p>The money would come from the $80 billion boost to the IRS that Democrats approved last August as part of their signature climate change, health care and tax package known as the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA.</p>
<p>The $20 billion clawback provision is not in the bill text, which only includes a $1.39 billion rescission to that IRS funding.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — A U.S. default on its debt would have a significantly broader impact on federal operations, financial markets and the global economy than recent government shutdowns that have left ordinary Americans largely untouched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the two have been confused frequently during debate over the debt limit, the federal government has had considerable practice with partial government shutdowns during the past decade — unlike a default on the debt, which would be uncharted territory. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned default could come as soon as June 1 without an agreement between Congress and President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government shutdowns don’t hit payments for Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, since Congress places those programs in the mandatory category that’s exempt from the annual government funding process and therefore predominantly exempt from funding lapses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A default would potentially reduce payments that keep millions of households afloat, as well as payments to states and providers for health care for elderly and low-income Americans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government shutdowns don’t affect the financial markets that much anymore, meaning Americans’ retirement accounts typically don’t start shrinking the longer a lapse in government operations extends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists expect that would be much different in an unprecedented debt default. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">William Galston, Ezra K. Zilkha chair and senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said partial government shutdowns and a default on the debt are “almost like mirror images of each other.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the first case, there’s money available but no plan to authorize and appropriate expenditures of that money. That’s when the government shuts down,” explained Galston, who served as a top domestic official in the Clinton administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you reach the debt limit, the government has already enacted programs — some of which are permanent programs, like Social Security and Medicare — but it no longer has the money to pay for them, because it can’t borrow what it needs to fill the gap between what it’s taking in and what it would have to put out,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That even includes the military. The Pentagon is bracing for a series of “severe” and unknown consequences for troops and national security should lawmakers fail to address the debt ceiling, officials told States Newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because there is no precedent for a default, it is difficult to know the precise impacts on specific federal programs. But what’s clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” a Pentagon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Here are more of the specific ways a default could roll across America:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Social Security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the U.S. government defaults, payments to the estimated </span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">67 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people who are relying on Social Security this year could be delayed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Security is the </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11615" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> government program in terms of how many Americans are affected by it, including retired workers and dependents, people with disabilities and surviving dependents of deceased workers who count on Social Security payments as a major source of income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A temporary disruption in payments to those who depend on Social Security income to pay their own bills could result in “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">impacts that would ripple through the economy at-large,” </span><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/default-would-have-a-catastrophic-impact-on-the-economy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jean Ross, a senior fellow for economic policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of 2022, roughly 48.6 million retired workers along with 2.7 million of their dependents relied on Social Security checks that averaged $1,825 a month, according to the Social Security Agency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. </span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $1.2 trillion on Social Security benefits in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The short story here is that U.S. taxpayers owe people money because of legislation enacted in the past. We can talk about what kinds of recent legislation have pushed up federal borrowing means, but in fact some of this legislation was passed 90 years ago,” said Wendy Edelberg,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> director of The Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in economic studies at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution, on a call Thursday with a group of economists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We owe interest to those who have lent to the U.S. by purchasing Treasury securities. We owe (money to) doctors and hospitals who have treated Medicare and Medicaid patients, and millions of people are entitled to benefits,” said Edelberg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Social Security Administration referred all questions about a possible default to the U.S. Treasury. Treasury did not respond to an inquiry for more information.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Veterans benefits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Veterans Administration Press Secretary Terrence Hayes said he does not have a “blueprint for what happens to the VA” if lawmakers do not strike a deal in the coming days. The Treasury Department will soon exhaust all special accounting maneuvers it has been using since January when the U.S. hit its $31.4 trillion debt ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because there is no precedent for a default, it is difficult to know the precise impacts on specific federal programs. But what is clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” Hayes said in an emailed statement to States Newsroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Treasury makes payments totaling $25 billion on behalf of the VA each month, according to the agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are 4 million disabled veterans whose payments are scheduled for June 1, and those payments are now uncertain,” said Edelberg, citing recent estimates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more detailed list of those payments, according to the VA’s figures, include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$12 billion per month in benefits payments to more than 7.1 million veterans and their families</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4.8 billion per month in pay to more than 451,000 VA employees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.6 billion per month to community providers caring for roughly 900,000 veterans per month</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.8 billion per month to medical and other contractors, on over 114,000 contracts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$835 million per month in pharmacy costs, for roughly 57,000 monthly payments</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion per month for other costs, including to small and veteran-owned businesses</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hayes also said there is a risk that the VA’s vendors could decide “to reduce or completely cease providing goods and services to VA if payment was uncertain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As President Biden has made clear, a default would be catastrophic for the American people and for our nation’s veterans,” he said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Medicare and Medicaid</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government payments to physicians, skilled nursing homes, hospitals and insurance companies could lag behind if lawmakers do not raise the U.S. borrowing limit so that the government can pay its bills on time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of September 2022, more than </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/pillar/expand-access" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">65 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Americans were enrolled in Medicare, the federal program that pays for health care for Americans age 65 and up and certain younger people with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare plans are categorized into four options — parts A, B, C and D — that range from inpatient hospital stay coverage to prescription drug benefits and various medical services in between. As of 2022, 49 million Americans relied on Medicare Part D for prescription drug coverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Private practices, hospitals, and community health centers, many of which run on tight budgets and rely on timely payments for providing services, would be in the unprecedented situation of being unsure of whether they will be paid for providing care to patients covered by Medicaid and Medicare,” said Antoinette Kraus, spokesperson for the advocacy group Pennsylvania Health Access Network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A default would create tremendous uncertainty for doctors and patients alike. Patients who are receiving treatment for a serious health condition or who require regular care for a disability or chronic condition could find themselves unable to get the care they need,” Kraus said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-income individuals, including children, disabled or pregnant persons and seniors, can receive health care coverage under Medicaid, a joint federal-state program that provides medical and long-term care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the more than 93 million Americans enrolled in some form of Medicaid, 46.2% were children, according to January </span><a href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/program-information/medicaid-and-chip-enrollment-data/report-highlights/index.html#:~:text=93%2C008%2C246%20individuals%20were%20enrolled%20in,individuals%20were%20enrolled%20in%20CHIP." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is very likely that federal Medicaid payments to states would, along with many other obligations of the federal government, be delayed,” said Kate McEvoy, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. “Default is a very different scenario from an impasse in settling the federal budget, in which case payments for Medicaid and other entitlements continue to be made.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most nursing home residents </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10343" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Medicaid and Medicare to cover their care, meaning a potential default is especially alarming to the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the long term care industry already experiencing a historic workforce crisis and recovering from the pandemic, any disruption of lifeline reimbursements will result in devastating consequences for our nation’s most vulnerable individuals who need access to care. However, we remain optimistic that policymakers will come to a solution,” said a spokesperson for the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, which identifies itself as the largest association in the U.S. representing long-term care facilities.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Federal employees</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a partial government shutdown, exempt federal employees report to work without pay, while non-exempt federal workers are sent home without pay — a situation Congress remedies once they reach a funding agreement. The exempt employees keep the government functioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Federation of Government Employees Public Policy Director Jacqueline Simon said a default on the debt that lasts long enough for federal employees to miss a paycheck would be a vastly different experience than what they’ve dealt with during past shutdowns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The union, which represents 750,000 workers within the federal government and the District of Columbia’s local government, hasn’t sent any guidance to its members about what to do if they don’t get paid during a default. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an unprecedented situation and operations will be in uncharted waters,” Simon said. “And there’s no way to make guidance based on law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public safety employees, Simon said, have worked without pay during past partial government shutdowns with a promise they’d get paid eventually when a bipartisan agreement was struck — something she expects they would do after a debt default is resolved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In previous shutdowns, public safety employees have been called into work, expected to show up to work with the promise that they’d get paid eventually when the appropriations bills pass,” Simon said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I assume there’d be a similar kind of situation where you don’t even need appropriations bills to pass, you just need the default to end,” she said, later adding that because the United States has never defaulted, “nobody really knows.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Substance use prevention and recovery, mental health</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. is facing a staggering drug overdose epidemic, and many states and local governments rely on </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46426" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal grants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for prevention and treatment efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug overdose rates in the U.S. have risen fivefold in the past two decades, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db457.htm#:~:text=Drug%20overdose%20deaths%20have%20risen,increased%20from%2017.1%20to%2019.6." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in December. In 2021 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the CDC </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/202205.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tracked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a record 107,622 overdose deaths — of which 71,238 were due to manmade, illegal fentanyl substances, an issue in the crosshairs of both Democrats and Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illicit fentanyl ending up in other drugs — for example, counterfeit prescription pills, cocaine and heroin — has been the target of </span><a href="https://www.dea.gov/onepill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal agencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the subject of multiple congressional hearings and </span><a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2023/01/26/u-s-house-gop-takes-aim-at-fake-pills-containing-deadly-fentanyl-sold-on-social-media/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roundtables</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA, administers two major grant programs: one for substance abuse prevention and treatment services, the other for mental health services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency, housed under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46426" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">devoted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 65% of its $5.89 billion program budget in 2020 to treatment programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facilities that receive federal dollars could be in limbo if the government defaults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a little hard to tell. I don’t know if the publicly funded facilities would stop accepting patients or if they would assume that it’s going to be paid at a later date. And, you know, it’s just so unclear and up in the air because this is such an unusual situation,” said Mark Dunn, director of public policy for the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SAMHSA did not respond to requests for comment.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">National defense</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin </span><a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/hearings/review-of-the-presidents-fiscal-year-2024-budget-request-for-the-department-of-defense" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Senate appropriators on May 11 that a potential default brings uncertainty for the over </span><a href="https://demographics.militaryonesource.mil/chapter-1-total-military-force" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3.4 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> military personnel and the U.S. military’s global presence and commitments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is substantial risk to our reputation,” Austin testified. “Again, we are viewed as being a source of stability globally. And we always pay our debts, and there’s just a number of things that we’re working with allies and partners on and that would come into question as to whether or not we’ll be able to execute programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But most importantly, this will affect the livelihood of our troops and our civilians. We won’t be able to pay people like we should and, and I think that’s something that China and everybody else can exploit,” he continued.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">USDA food assistance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One in four Americans, from infants to seniors, participate in one of the 15 food and nutrition assistance programs offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those programs offer monthly assistance, such as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, referred to as WIC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the government defaults, monthly payments to more than </span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/34SNAPmonthly-5.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">42.5 million Americans on </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">SNAP, and monthly payments to the more than 6 million families on WIC, could be delayed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent bill that House Republicans barely </span><a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/04/26/u-s-house-gop-pushes-through-debt-ceiling-increase-coupled-with-massive-spending-cuts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">temporarily raise the U.S. borrowing limit also tightened access to food and assistance for low-income Americans by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expediting the effective dates for safety net work requirements — from 2025 to 2024 for SNAP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SNAP already has </span><a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/work-requirements" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two sets of work requirements.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another program that could be affected if there are delays in payments is the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, where each month USDA sends packed foods to about </span><a href="https://fns-prod.azureedge.us/sites/default/files/resource-files/fdpir-program-fact-sheet-2020-for%20website.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">84,000 individuals on Native American reservations.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A USDA spokesperson said in an email that the exact impact of certain federal programs can depend on uncertain factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But what’s clear is that, without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed,” the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">S</span><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=104891#:~:text=The%20USDA%27s%20National%20School%20Lunch,schools%20and%20residential%20childcare%20institutions." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chool lunches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which USDA provides for more than 30 million children each day, could also be affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other child nutrition programs that could get wrapped up in payment delays include the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program and the Special Milk Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisa Davis, the senior vice president of the No Kid Hungry campaign at Share Our Strength, said in an email that a default would have a devastating impact on families and individuals who rely on food assistance programs such as SNAP. Share Our Strength is a national organization that aims to end child hunger and poverty in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only is SNAP being used as a bargaining chip in these negotiations, but the people who benefit from this critical program will be some of the individuals hit hardest if a government default becomes reality,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers could also run into problems if there are delays to any USDA payments, ranging from crop insurance payouts to new loans for expanding farming operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDA </span><a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/05/01/usda-providing-130-million-assistance-help-farmers-facing-financial" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in early May an additional $130 million in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatic financial assistance for qualifying farm loan program borrowers who are facing financial risk. Those who qualify will receive automatic payments from the Farm Service Agency, but those funds could be delayed if the country were to default on its debt.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Homeland security</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the U.S. government were to default, it would mean the U.S. Department of Homeland Security would have to delay payments to various private contractors such as those that run </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immigration and Customs Enforcement </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">detention facilities, and even delays in grants to nonprofits that provide aid and transportation to migrants seeking asylum.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would also mean that the more than </span><a href="https://www.tsa.gov/news/press/factsheets/tsa-glance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50,000 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation Security Administration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s across more than 440 airports could have their paychecks delayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court proceedings before immigration judges would also be delayed. There is already a more than </span><a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/us-immigration-backlogs-mounting-undermine-biden" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6 million backlog of cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Justice, which handles immigration court proceedings, did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Highways and transit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Highway Trust Fund, which sends money from federal gas and diesel taxes to states for road and transit maintenance and construction, could also see a rare disruption in outlays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On paper, the trust fund has a healthy balance — it was </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/highwaytrustfund/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$94.2 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the beginning of April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if Treasury doesn’t have the money to actually spend, that could mean payments from the trust fund would be delayed, said Jeff Davis, a transportation spending expert and senior fellow at the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonpartisan think tank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After making debt service payments, there’s no clear indication what already-obligated spending would take priority, putting highway and transit funds on par with scores of other programs, Davis said, cautioning that his analysis was provisional because it was not backed by precedent or Treasury Department guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think they’re going to have to wait in line with everybody else,” Davis said of Highway Trust Fund payments if the debt limit is hit. “Just because there’s theoretically that much money in the trust fund doesn’t make a difference if there’s actually no dollars in the Treasury.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Conservation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservation advocates won a huge legislative victory in 2020 when Congress passed the Great American Outdoors Act that provided $900 million annually for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and removed the fund from the annual appropriations process by classifying it as mandatory spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2020, the fund, which is filled by fees on offshore oil and gas development and used to protect national parks and forests, wildlife refuges, coasts and other natural areas and provides matching grants for state and local recreation projects, was subject to periodic fights over its funding levels and — at times — its continued existence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proponents considered the 2020 law approving the fund in perpetuity a once-in-a-generation victory. Montana Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, a leading proponent of the measure, thanked then-President Donald Trump “for signing the most important piece of conservation legislation in over 50 years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a default could reintroduce the uncertainty proponents thought they’d erased with the 2020 law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A default would be an economic disaster across the board — even in ways we don’t know yet,” U.S. House Natural Resources ranking member Raúl Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, said in a written statement. “The Treasury would likely have to make tough calls about extraordinary measures to redirect mandatory funds to pay our debt, so even widely beloved programs like the Land and Water Conservation Fund could be at-risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokeswoman for the U.S. Interior Department, which manages the fund, declined to comment on what would happen in a potential default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can’t speculate on unforeseen circumstances,” the spokeswoman, Melissa Schwartz, wrote in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Daines spokeswoman Rachel Dumke declined to entertain the possibility of default.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Senator Daines does not see a default on the national debt as an option and he is calling on President Biden to make a deal with Speaker McCarthy as soon as possible to avoid a crisis,” she wrote in an email.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Housing assistance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said in an email that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">without the ability for the federal government to borrow funds, there is a very real potential that any government program or payment would be halted or severely delayed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HUD handles rental assistance, housing vouchers, claims of unfair housing practices, obtaining affordable loans and public housing, among other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of HUD’s key agency programs and initiatives, which play a vital role for Americans across the country, could be halted or severely delayed … which would impact our nation’s most vulnerable communities,” the spokesperson said.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_23_045" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the agency announced more than 2,400 grants totaling $5.6 billion in funding for 1,200 communities across the U.S. for community development, homeless assistance and affordable housing. Payments to those programs could be delayed if the government defaults.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito postponed a ruling on access to the abortion pill until Friday as the high court continues considering arguments from anti-abortion organizations and the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alito’s two-day-long pause, issued Wednesday, keeps a ruling from U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk on hold. The Supreme Court is considering whether to allow mifepristone to stay on the market amid the appeals process or implement changes.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the second short-term stay from Alito. The first, issued on Friday, April 14, was set to expire Wednesday at midnight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kacsmaryk’s </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-administration-appeals-judges-ruling-ordering-abortion-pill-us-market" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling in early April </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">suspended the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s 2000 approval of mifepristone, the first of two prescriptions used in medication abortions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government had </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-department-justice-asks-appeals-court-pause-abortion-pill-ruling" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">requested the 5th Circuit place that ruling on pause </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">during the appeal, but that three-judge panel declined. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the 5th Circuit </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-justice-department-ask-supreme-court-reject-limits-access-abortion-pill-1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled that while the case advances,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doctors would need to prescribe mifepristone under the guidelines that were in place before the FDA made changes during 2016 and 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That ruling would have meant that mifepristone would no longer have been approved for up to 10 weeks gestation, but would only have been approved for use up to seven weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients would have had to attend three in-person doctor visits instead of one, all adverse events would have had to be reported to the FDA and prescribing and administration of the medication would have reverted to pre-2016 instructions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would also have prevented doctors from prescribing mifepristone via telehealth or the medication being sent through the mail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The generic version of mifepristone would no longer have been approved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alito’s second, short-term stay of both lower court rulings ensures that access to mifepristone stays exactly as it is now through Friday at 11:59 p.m. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has temporarily halted any changes in access to the abortion medication mifepristone from taking effect until Wednesday at midnight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-page order from Alito, issued late Friday afternoon, will block for now the April 7 ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas that suspended the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s 2000 approval of mifepristone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was set to take effect Friday at midnight. However, in 17 states and the District of Columbia, the Texas ruling was in conflict with a separate ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, where a judge ruled that the FDA couldn’t change access to mifepristone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans had moved to partially block the Texas district court’s nationwide ruling from taking effect following an appeal from the federal government and manufacturer of the brand-name abortion pill, Danco Laboratories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That </span><a href="https://bit.ly/3MHUAbZ" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from the three-judge panel, would have allowed mifepristone to stay on the market, though it would have required doctors to prescribe and administer the medication under guidelines that were in place before 2016. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government and Danco Laboratories rejected that decision from the appeals court and </span><a href="https://bit.ly/3o5ObwS" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in the federal government’s appeal to the Supreme Court that the 5th Circuit&#8217;s partial stay would immediately &#8220;render all extant doses of mifepristone misbranded because their labeling would be inconsistent with the operative conditions of approval.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The generic version of the drug would cease to be approved altogether,&#8221; she added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GenBioPro, Inc., the maker of the generic abortion pill, wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court the 5th Circuit’s partial stay “illustrates the essential folly and manifest danger of allowing federal drug approvals to be decided through nationwide injunctions rendered by individual district courts based on the claims of particular private litigants.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GenBioPro also noted that about two-thirds of all medication abortions in the country use their generic version of the abortion pill.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pre-2016 prescribing instructions for medication abortion, a two-dose regimen that includes misoprostol, would have reduced the ceiling for use from 10 weeks gestation to seven weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would have required only doctors to prescribe and administer it as opposed to other health care providers with licenses to prescribe pharmaceuticals. It would have required patients attend three in-person visits, banned telehealth and ended dispensation of the medication by mail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alito wrote in the order that “any response to the application be filed on or before Tuesday, April 18, 2023, by 12 p.m.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NARAL Pro-Choice America President Mini Timmaraju said in a statement in reaction to Alito’s order that “while medication abortion remains legal for now, this case should never have been heard in the first place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nothing about the rulings from the lower courts’ Trump-appointed judges had any basis in medical science — both are steeped in reckless disinformation and total disregard for the law,&#8221; Timmaraju said. &#8220;As this case continues, safe and effective medication abortion in all 50 states is at severe risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Erin Hawley said in a statement that Alito’s “brief administrative stay is standard operating procedure whenever the Supreme Court is asked to consider an emergency request like this one.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It gives the court sufficient time to consider the parties’ arguments before ruling,” Hawley said. “We look forward to explaining why the FDA has not met its heavy burden to pause the parts of the district court’s decision that restore the critical safeguards for women and girls that were unlawfully removed by the FDA.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — The CEO of Moderna on Wednesday defended the company’s decision to drastically increase the price of its COVID-19 vaccine later this year, arguing that an expected drop in demand, changes to its distribution process and the overall benefit of the vaccine warrant the higher cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That decision was met with bipartisan condemnation from U.S. senators on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Many criticized the decision before noting the federal government invested nearly $2 billion in Moderna’s development of the vaccine as well as providing a collaboration with the National Institutes of Health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Stéphane Bancel pledged during the hearing that even with the price increasing from less than $30 to about $130 a dose, Moderna would develop a system to provide uninsured or underinsured Americans with the COVID-19 vaccine and boosters at no cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bancel, however, was unable to answer numerous questions from U.S. lawmakers about how the process would work in practice, indicating the company was still working out the broad parameters as well as the details. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bancel annoyed several members on the panel when he declined to say directly if Moderna would negotiate the new price with the federal government to reduce the cost to taxpayers for COVID-19 vaccines provided through Medicare, Medicaid, or the Veterans Affairs health care system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bancel also declined to say if people in the United States would pay less for the vaccine than those in other countries, whose governments didn’t invest in its development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The price will depend on the value in each country,” Bancel said. “The cost of health care is different in each country.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Baldwin questions motives</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin questioned if Moderna’s decision to increase the price of its COVID-19 vaccine was linked to Bancel receiving a recent performance review in which the board said he “underperformed the company&#8217;s target for sales income generated by the COVID-19 vaccine.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baldwin said the decision to increase the price of the vaccine “appears tied to the impact of your personal performance assessment on your bonus and how much you would stand to gain personally from increasing the price of the COVID vaccine.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bancel contended the two were not linked, saying the price of the vaccine is determined by the value of the product and how much money can be saved in the long term through reduced hospital stays. He noted the cost of a high-dose flu vaccine for the elderly costs about $90 and the pneumonia vaccine costs about $240.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baldwin also asked about Moderna’s stock buybacks, which totaled $3.3 billion in 2022 and more than $800 million in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are one of the, if not the, largest shareholders in Moderna,” Baldwin told Bancel. “Yet, despite spending significantly to buy back stock over the last two years, Moderna&#8217;s share price has actually declined. If you had not spent nearly $5 billion on buybacks when your stock was at the highest price it&#8217;s ever been, do you think you would be under less pressure to raise the price of COVID vaccine now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bancel declined any connection, saying the vaccine’s “price is not linked to the company’s performance. The price is linked to the value of the product, to the patient and to the impact on the patient. That’s how we set the price.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bancel said Moderna believes the price it charged the U.S. government for the COVID-19 vaccine throughout the last couple of years represents a discount, in part because the company wanted to return the investment it got from the U.S. government to develop the vaccine, and in part because the federal government was purchasing in bulk. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Braun: ‘preposterous’ increase</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun told Bancel that Moderna’s price increase “is indicative of a much bigger problem facing health care” and expressed frustration that some facets of the health care industry operate like an unregulated utility by not embracing competition or transparency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Braun challenged Bancel for saying that one of the reasons the price is going up is to account for Moderna moving from the pandemic model, where it distributed the vaccine to the U.S. government through three Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warehouses, to a regular distribution process where it will need to get the vaccine to thousands of locations throughout the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A 400% price increase is preposterous, especially when you&#8217;ve been given all this government largesse,” Braun said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bancel testified Moderna is trying to figure out how it could best set up the new distribution network, noting the company has never had a commercial product. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxpayer investment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christopher Morten, associate clinical professor of law at Columbia Law School, said during his testimony on a second panel that Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine costs just $3 to make. He also criticized the price increase decision, saying Moderna benefited significantly from U.S. taxpayer investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. Bancel claims the value of these vaccines justifies Moderna’s proposed price increase. But his testimony ignored a key question — who created that value?” Morten said. “It was the U.S. government, the American taxpayer that spent billions. It was government scientists that toiled alongside Moderna’s.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moderna wasn’t the primary inventor of the three key scientific features of the vaccine, with the federal government providing the company with the specific mRNA sequence used in the vaccine, according to Morten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. government also designed and ran the early clinical trials and provided Moderna with money and resources to expand its manufacturing, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be clear, Moderna’s scientists and engineers made many contributions of their own, as did many academic scientists. These people and their work deserve credit and celebration too,” Morten said. “But Moderna cannot claim the vaccine’s value for itself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — The White House revealed Thursday morning that more classified documents from President Joe Biden’s time as vice president were discovered outside of secure government facilities, this time in the garage at his Wilmington, Delaware home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The files have since been turned over to the U.S. Justice Department, which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opened a special counsel investigation into the matter. Another set of documents with classified markings also dating to the Obama administration were discovered earlier at a think tank associated with Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, speaking Thursday afternoon, said he’d appointed former federal prosecutor Robert Hur to lead the investigation to determine if Biden had mishandled classified material. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This appointment underscores for the public the department&#8217;s commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters, and to making decisions indisputably guided only by the facts and the law,” Garland said. “I am confident that Mr. Hur will carry out his responsibility in an even-handed and urgent manner, and in accordance with the highest traditions of this department.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hur was appointed in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump to lead the federal prosecutor’s office in Maryland and joined the law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher in April 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden expanded on the developments during brief remarks Thursday morning following a speech on the economy, saying his lawyers “discovered a small number of documents with classified markings in storage areas and file cabinets in my home and in my personal library.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden added, while being questioned by reporters, that the garage, where he also stores his classic Corvettes, was locked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By the way, my Corvettes [are] in a locked garage. It’s not like they’re sitting out on the street,” Biden said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Second discovery</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The finding of additional classified documents was announced in a written statement by Richard Sauber, special counsel to the president. The disclosure came after documents with classified markings were found at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, D.C., in November 2022, and the president’s lawyers began searching his residences in Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those lawyers found “a small number of additional Obama-Biden Administration records with classified markings,” according to Sauber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All but one of these documents were found in storage space in the President’s Wilmington residence garage,” Sauber said. “One document consisting of one page was discovered among stored materials in an adjacent room. No documents were found in the Rehoboth Beach residence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawyers immediately contacted the Department of Justice and arranged to turn over the documents, Sauber said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Garland’s remarks, Sauber said Biden and his legal team “will continue that cooperation with the Special Counsel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are confident that a thorough review will show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, and the President and his lawyers acted promptly upon discovery of this mistake,” Sauber added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department received notice from Biden’s personal attorney on Dec. 20 that the additional classified documents had been found, Garland said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden in his remarks reiterated that he respects the federal government’s classification process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As I said earlier this week, people know I take classified documents and classified materials seriously,” Biden said. “I also said we’re cooperating fully with the Justice Department&#8217;s review.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garland laid out a timeline of when the department learned of the classified documents. The National Archives Office of the Inspector General first notified the Justice Department on Nov. 4 that documents were stored at the Penn Biden Center, Garland said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump comparisons</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discovery of classified documents in Biden’s private residence, not just an office he used after his time as vice president, immediately drew comparisons to the classified documents found inside Trump’s private residence at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those documents were, however, only recovered by the government after the FBI secured a search warrant for parts of his property amid an ongoing struggle by the National Archives to get back all of the classified documents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal authorities are </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/search-warrant-shows-trump-under-investigation-possible-espionage-act-violations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigating Trump for possible Espionage Act violations </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">because of classified documents he took from the White House to Mar-a-Lago. The FBI executed a search of his residence in August, finding about 100 classified documents out of 11,000 total documents, the Justice Department </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-justice-department-appeal-trump-special-master-order" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search followed Trump’s return to the National Archives of documents, including 184 with classified markings, that had been held at Mar-a-Lago after he left the White House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Republicans seized upon the Biden revelations. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, rebuked Biden for keeping the documents with classified markings at an office and his personal residence in Delaware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think Congress has to investigate this,” McCarthy said. “Here’s an individual that’s been in office for more than 40 years, here&#8217;s an individual that said on ‘60 Minutes’ that [he] was so concerned about President Trump’s documents.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy added: “I do not think any American believes that justice should not be equal to all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden answered questions about the documents just after a speech on the U.S. economy, where he was hoping to focus on low unemployment and reduced inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The data is clear, even though inflation is high in major economies around the world, it is coming down in America month after month,” Biden said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — The U.S. House adopted rules for the 118th Congress on Monday, though several of the concessions Speaker Kevin McCarthy made with more conservative members of the Republican Party to secure the gavel weren’t included in the document or publicly circulated ahead of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules118.house.gov/files/BILLS-118hresPIH-118th-rules-of-the-house-of-reps-V3.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">55-page rules package</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the House voted nearly party-line</span> <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/202323?Page=2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">220-213</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to adopt sets the parameters for how bills should be written, how committees will operate and how the floor will run during the next two years. The majority in every Congress writes its own such rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it doesn’t include promises McCarthy reportedly made to cut spending by more than $100 billion, place hard-right lawmakers on key committees and put together some sort of debt limit plan ahead of a default deadline later this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Rep</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Tony Gonzales of Texas was the sole member of his party to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">vote against adopting the rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gonzales didn’t speak during floor debate Monday but said on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-republican-opposes-house-rules-package-warns-nightmare-party" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox &amp; Friends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” on Sunday that he opposed the rules package because of an agreement to cut spending to the last fiscal year’s levels and a provision that allows any one member to call for a no-confidence vote on the speaker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m against the rules for a couple of different reasons. One is the defense spending, the cut in defense. I think that&#8217;s an absolutely terrible idea,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gonzales said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But the other is the vacate the chair. I don&#8217;t want to see us every two months be in lockdown. This isn&#8217;t the parliament. The American public are counting on House Republicans to be the one savior in this all. If we can&#8217;t get this right, it&#8217;s going to be nightmare after nightmare.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Empowering the extremists’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, the top Democrat on the Rules Committee, urged opposition to the package during floor debate Monday afternoon, arguing that it would empower the extreme right of the House Republican Conference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s clear from all of this is that the Republican Party no longer cares about governing and this rules package is exhibit No. 1,” McGovern said. “This rules package puts politics first, empowering the extremists who are only interested in their own power.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland Democrat Steny Hoyer spoke against the changes, saying they would “impede” the work of the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, lamented that legislation brought to the floor during previous sessions of Congress was written “behind closed doors, by a small number of people not concerned about the consequences.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For a long time, we’ve been saying this needs to change. In fact, we ran on an agenda to change the way Washington works, to fix this broken system, to get our country back on track, and we were awarded the majority by the people across this country,” Scalise said. “So today starts that process of fixing what&#8217;s broken in Washington.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Rep. Chip Roy, one of the holdout GOP lawmakers who negotiated concessions from McCarthy last week in exchange for votes to become speaker, said on the floor that Republicans and McCarthy agreed to a floor vote on a Texas border security plan, a vote on legislation to set term limits for members and a process that would bring appropriations bills to the floor under open rules, which allow any member to offer amendments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, we have had conversations and agreements, as individuals are supposed to do,” Roy said. “Looking each other in the eye and saying, ‘We’re going to bring balanced budgets to the floor of the House.’ You bet that we’ve got agreements, we’re going to do that.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New select panel on coronavirus</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the rule changes are new budgetary constraints and reporting, a requirement bills adhere to a single subject and a measure allowing any member to introduce a resolution that could lead to a no confidence vote on the speaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other proposed changes include the renaming of committees — for example, the Education and Labor Committee will be redubbed Education and the Workforce. The package calls for the empaneling of a select subcommittee to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans are moving from the pay-as-you-go rule that Democrats used to offset the cost of new mandatory spending to a cut-as-you-go rule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change “prohibits consideration of a bill, joint resolution, conference report, or amendment that has the net effect of increasing mandatory spending within a five-year or ten-year budget window,” according to a </span><a href="https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules118.house.gov/files/118-Rules-of-the-House-of-Representatives-SxS-V2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP summary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the rules changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans are reinstating a rule that legislation must be released at least 72 hours before floor votes can take place, an effort to address Republican criticism that there’s often not enough time to read and understand legislation before members are expected to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rep. Michelle Fischbach, a Minnesota Republican, said during floor debate the provision would “allow more thoughtful and deliberate consideration that will improve what we pass out of this House.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New reporting requirements for major legislation mandate that the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan scorekeeper, include a long-term economic outlook when giving a budget score to the bill, including effects on economic output, employment and capital stocks.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Handshake deals</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not included in the official rules package, or public documents, are reported handshake deals that McCarthy made with certain members of his party in order </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-backs-mccarthy-speaker-after-tense-and-chaotic-late-night-session-25" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to secure the votes needed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to become speaker last week following four days of voting and 15 ballots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California Republican reportedly promised members he’ll reduce discretionary spending to fiscal 2022 levels, cutting more than $115 billion compared to current levels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a written statement Monday the impact of reducing defense spending, which some Republicans swear they won’t agree to, would make the United States “less capable of keeping the American people safe and advancing our national security interests.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This push to defund our military in the name of politics is senseless and out of line with our national security needs,” Bates said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats voiced concerns about proposed reductions in government spending, including possible defense cuts and threats to programs like Social Security and Medicare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is an extreme proposal that&#8217;s in front of us,” Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal said during floor debate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they follow the logic to its manifestation, this will pit Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid against defense spending,” Neal added. “Our seniors will be sold out, our military will be sold out, and the full faith and credit of the United States will be under threat. All in a quest to organize the House.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">IRS staffing bill </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both parties accused the other side of so-called “weaponization” of government agencies and congressional investigations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP plans to pass a bill late Monday to pull funding for additional staffing and enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service, accusing Democrats of targeting everyday Americans with tax audits. The bill is likely to hit a roadblock in the Democrat-majority Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP legislation would increase the deficit by $114 billion over 10 years, according to </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58894" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an analysis </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">released Monday by the CBO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the panel to investigate COVID-19 origins and policies, the GOP also included in its rules the establishment of a panel that will be “committed to investigating the radical left position of the federal government,” said Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who now chairs the Rules Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican majority is expected in the coming days to bring two abortion-related bills to the House floor — legislation that was outlined in the rules package.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a week of chaos, we now have a rules package for MAGA extremists attacking our freedoms and every major responsibility of this body,” said Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This package criminalizes abortion by advancing bills that attack access and health care without a single hearing or markup.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House will reconvene Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of this week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — The U.S. House slogged through more votes for speaker Thursday, with Republicans unable to reach consensus about whether Kevin McCarthy should lead them during the 118th Congress, or if another lawmaker should win the gavel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-one Republicans, including Bob Good of Virginia, voted against McCarthy during the third day, signaling that ongoing closed-door negotiations and talks on the House floor from McCarthy allies haven’t succeeded yet. The level of opposition was unchanged from Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Like I said from the beginning, we want to change things fundamentally here so this place works for the American people. And we&#8217;re not going to stop going until we get that one way or the other,” Pennsylvania’s Scott Perry said during a brief interview as voting dragged on inside the chamber. “Either we have the tools to do it, or we have the personnel to do it. It’s going to be one, or the other.”</span></p>
</div>
<p>On Twitter, Good declared that &#8220;for the sake of the American people and the future of our country, Republicans must not settle for Kevin McCarthy.&#8221;</p>

<div id="modal-ready">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy’s backing through two rounds of ballots continued to hold at 201 votes, with 20 members of his conference voting for other candidates — including Florida’s Byron Donalds, Oklahoma’s Kevin Hern and former President Donald Trump — and one member voting present. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska’s Don Bacon reiterated Thursday that a stronghold of the Republican conference will remain behind McCarthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in for the long haul,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats continued to uniformly back New York’s Hakeem Jeffries, who holds the most votes for speaker, with 212. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House cannot move on from speaker debate unless a candidate gets at least 218 votes or the chamber adjourns, as it did on </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gops-hard-right-flank-tanks-mccarthys-bid-be-house-speaker-multiple-ballots" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-paralyzed-following-second-day-gop-failure-elect-speaker" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until Republicans unite around McCarthy or a consensus candidate emerges, the 434 current House members cannot be sworn in and committees cannot form, leaving the chamber stuck.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic rebuke</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Democrats rebuked the GOP stalemate in floor speeches Thursday, with the new leadership trio — Majority Leader Jeffries, Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California — releasing a joint statement as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“House Democrats are united and ready to get to work,” they said. “Unfortunately, House Republicans remain unable to organize themselves in a manner that allows the Congress to move forward and do the business of the American people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michigan’s John James, an incoming freshman Republican, sought to contextualize the ongoing GOP stalemate by referencing the speaker election of the 34th Congress, noting it took lawmakers more than 133 votes over two months to elect Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The issues today are over a few rules and personalities, while the issues at that time were about slavery and whether the value of a man who looks like me was 60% or 100% of a human being,” James said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was a long, drawn-out, painful process. But it needed to happen,” James continued. “And in the end, Nathaniel Banks won by the slimmest of margins. But you know, margins don’t matter when your policies are on the right side of history.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James, who nominated McCarthy ahead of the seventh ballot, also pressed all of his Republican colleagues to back the California Republican and not let the process extend longer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The American people have told us, by putting a Republican majority here, that they want Republicans to lead, and they want a government that works and doesn&#8217;t embarrass them,” James said. “And we are failing on both missions. That must change today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But North Carolina’s Dan Bishop offered Donalds as an alternative candidate ahead of the seventh ballot, arguing that McCarthy wasn’t the right person for the role. Arizona’s Andy Biggs offered Donalds on the eighth ballot. And Montana’s Matt Rosendale nominated Donalds on the ninth ballot, underway late Thursday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are committed to make change to this institution that has lost its way,” Bishop said, calling Donalds a “man of personal conviction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bishop said the ongoing gridlock within the House GOP will be resolved, though he didn’t offer details for a clear path forward during his floor speech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People ask me what is the end game? How does this end? The answer to this question is that this is a dynamic process,” Bishop said. “All of the decisions on this floor result from the coming together of minds — one way or another.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy told reporters he remained optimistic while rushing between meetings inside the U.S. Capitol Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think everybody, of the members I&#8217;ve talked to, (has) been very productive. They&#8217;ve been productive in their discussions, their ideas. … They want to find a solution that’s possible,” McCarthy said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Concessions by McCarthy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are concerns within the House Republican Conference about some of the concessions McCarthy might make to get the backing of the 218 House members needed to become speaker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama’s Robert Aderholt said during a brief interview before the House session that potentially allowing Maryland Rep. Andy Harris to elbow Oklahoma’s Tom Cole out as chairman of the spending panel that controls funding for the departments of Education, Health and Human Services and Labor “is a bridge too far.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you start into the seniority process, I think that&#8217;s going a bit too far and I would have very great concerns about that,” Aderholt said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aderholt, a senior appropriator and subcommittee chairman, said whether House GOP leaders bring the dozen annual government funding bills to the floor under open rules, which allow any member to offer any amendment, could be challenging. Open rules for such bills are a demand by McCarthy opponents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House hasn’t used open rules for spending bills in several years, with both Republicans and Democrats opting for a process that allows for limited amendment debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll be honest with you, I have mixed emotions about it,” Aderholt said. “I think generally speaking, when you have an open rule, it&#8217;s a good idea. But also too, you can get some crazy amendment in there. And so I think it&#8217;s a double-edged sword. So I think we’ve got to go into this with all eyes open.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin&#8217;s Mike Gallagher said during an interview as the votes went on that the biggest roadblock to Republicans uniting around McCarthy for speaker “seems to be just basic trust.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallagher also questioned how McCarthy potentially giving into demands from the opposition group that a minimum number of its members be placed on certain committees, like Rules or Appropriations panels, would affect the conference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you say, &#8216;Okay, you get X spots on the Rules Committee and X spots on the Appropriations Committee,&#8217; well, then every faction in the Republican caucus is going to [say], ‘I want three spots on Ag. I want, you know, 10 spots on Armed Services.’ Then it&#8217;s just chaos,” Gallagher said. </span></p>

(C-SPAN)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. House Republicans&#8217; stalemate over who should lead the chamber for the next two years dragged on Wednesday, with Kevin McCarthy failing to get the votes needed to become speaker on three more ballots. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chamber then adjourned until 8 p.m. Eastern to give the House GOP a chance to meet privately, though House Republican leaders had no clear plan to garner the support of the members who have vehemently opposed McCarthy.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second day of floor votes saw 21 GOP lawmakers including Bob Good of Virginia vote against the California congressman, despite ongoing efforts to turn members to his side. That was an increase of one from Tuesday, with Indiana’s Victoria Spartz now voting present. </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until McCarthy wins enough votes or the House elects another speaker, members-elect cannot be sworn in, meaning that while the 118th Congress is technically underway, the House has no members and no agreed-upon rules under which to operate, such as how legislation can be brought to the floor. The clerk of the House has been conducting the proceedings.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nebraska’s Don Bacon said late Wednesday afternoon that some Republicans are putting together a backup plan. </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a group of us that know that plan B has to be worked on,” Bacon said on a call hosted by D.C.-based political organization No Labels, which advocates for bipartisanship.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bacon wouldn’t reveal details about negotiations on a compromise candidate for House speaker. “We can’t be public about it for the time being,” he said. </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A social media post by former Republican President Donald Trump in the morning didn’t sway the holdouts to McCarthy’s side when the chamber came into session at noon.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Republicans, do not turn a great triumph into a giant &amp; embarrassing defeat,” Trump wrote, adding that McCarthy would do a “good job, and maybe even a great job.” </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert, a McCarthy opponent, called on Trump to reverse course during a floor speech in the afternoon, saying that the party should work together and “stop with the campaign smears and tactics to get people to turn against us.”</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even having my favorite president call us and tell us we need to knock this off,” Boebert said. “I think it actually needs to be reversed. The president needs to tell Kevin McCarthy that, sir, you do not have the votes and it’s time to withdraw.” </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy said before the floor votes that Republicans plan to keep talking and that he had the “same game plan as yesterday.” </span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ll find an agreement where we all get together, and we&#8217;ll work through this,” McCarthy told reporters around noon.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a call with select Republicans Wednesday morning, McCarthy touted his support from Trump, according to a GOP aide.</span><b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not going anywhere,” McCarthy said on the call that he led with Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana and GOP Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Adjournment unsuccessful in unifying GOP</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gops-hard-right-flank-tanks-mccarthys-bid-be-house-speaker-multiple-ballots" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">held three votes for speaker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday before the chamber adjourned for the night in an unsuccessful attempt to get Republicans to unify around a candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy lost the backing of 19 members on the first two votes before Florida’s Byron Donalds joined the group of lawmakers opposing McCarthy’s bid for speaker during the third ballot, bringing the total of opponents to 20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy needs the backing of at least 218 House members, a challenging task at the moment, given he can only lose four votes amid House Republicans’ especially narrow majority. That means McCarthy and his backers need to get at least 17 of the 21 members who voted against him Wednesday to change their minds. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Floridian backed for speaker</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP lawmakers opposing McCarthy rallied around Florida’s Donalds as their preferred candidate on the fourth, fifth and sixth ballots Wednesday, moving away from an earlier push for Ohio’s Jim Jordan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas Republican Chip Roy got a standing ovation from the entire House chamber when he noted that nominating Donalds for speaker, along with Democrats’ nomination of New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, represented “the first time in history there have been two Black Americans placed into the nomination for speaker of the House.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House held a second full standing ovation after Roy said that “we do not seek to judge people by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the GOP split over who should hold the speaker’s gavel continued throughout the afternoon, with the vast majority of the House Republican Conference pressing for McCarthy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">both during floor speeches and in what appeared to be tense conversations on the House floor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin&#8217;s Mike Gallagher, who nominated McCarthy on the fourth ballot, argued that the disagreement among Republicans was part of the democratic process, rebuffing criticism the party is in disarray. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure it looks messy, but democracy is messy,” Gallagher said. “That’s a feature, not a bug of our system. We air it all out, in the open for the American people to see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The floor speeches, however, didn’t move Republicans any closer to actually electing a speaker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McCarthy for the moment is staying put in the speaker’s race with the backing of 201 members of his conference. </span></p>

<div id="modal-ready">
<p>WASHINGTON — Republican control of the U.S. House got off to a rocky start Tuesday when the party was unable to decide who should become speaker amid a sharp disagreement within the party’s more conservative faction.</p>
<p>California Rep. Kevin McCarthy didn’t clinch the backing of the 218 lawmakers he needed to become the head of the chamber during the first three rounds of ballots, marking the first time in a century the speaker’s election went to multiple ballots.</p>
<p>After the unsuccessful first day, where opposition to McCarthy increased as the day went on, House Republicans moved to adjourn until noon Wednesday.</p>
<p>The move gives McCarthy more time to negotiate with the 20 GOP lawmakers who oppose his bid for speaker, possibly changing the tally before voting resumes.</p>
<p>McCarthy received 203 votes to Democratic nominee Hakeem Jeffries’ 212 votes on the first ballot, with the remaining support going to other GOP lawmakers.</p>
<p>McCarthy said after that vote that GOP leaders want to pass legislation addressing the border and the economy, but can’t do that until the party elects a speaker.</p>
<p>“We’ve certain members right now that think they can use a small majority to try to get themselves the gavel,” he said. “That’s not how it works.”</p>
<p>Reps. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Dan Bishop of North Carolina, Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Eli Crane of Arizona, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Bob Good of Virginia, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Ralph Norman of South Carolina, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Matt Rosendale of Montana were among the Republican members to vote against McCarthy on the first ballot. All of those GOP lawmakers voted for Biggs after Gosar nominated him.</p>
<p>Other GOP votes went to Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, New York Rep. Lee Zeldin and Florida Rep. Byron Donalds. Banks, Zeldin and Donalds were not formally nominated for speaker during the first round of voting.</p>
<p>The 19 Republican lawmakers who opposed McCarthy on the first ballot also voted against him during the second ballot, though all moved to voting for Jordan, who has said he doesn’t want the role and nominated McCarthy ahead of the second ballot.</p>
<p>During the third ballot, Florida’s Donalds joined the McCarthy opposition, writing in a tweet that the House should adjourn so Republicans can “huddle and find someone or work out the next steps.”</p>
<p>“When the dust settles, we will have a Republican Speaker, now is the time for our conference to debate and come to a consensus,” Donalds wrote. “This will take time, Democracy is messy at times, but we will be ready to govern on behalf of the American people. Debate is healthy.”</p>
<p>Good called for McCarthy to step aside following the first ballot, saying he expects Jordan to pick up ballots.</p>
<p>“The sooner he pulls out — for the good of the country, for the good of the Congress, for the good of the conference – the better everyone is and that way we can move together to try to find who the best person is that can reach 218,” Good said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Four-vote margin</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>House Republicans have an especially slim majority, with just a four-vote margin to pass bills across the floor or elect a speaker.</p>
<p>The impact of the razor-thin majority and divisions within the Republican Party about policy goals and its future were on full display Tuesday, with conservative members split over whether McCarthy should lead the party during the next two years or if another lawmaker was better suited to take the helm.</p>
<p>Gaetz said ahead of the first speaker vote that the group of conservative GOP lawmakers wants a commitment from McCarthy for balanced budgets, a Texas border plan, term limits and individual votes on earmarks.</p>
<p>Gaetz also said that incoming House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican, told Gaetz he would be kicked off the committee if he didn’t back McCarthy for speaker.</p>
<p>Boebert told reporters the group presented a plan to McCarthy on Monday evening that could have gotten him the votes needed to become speaker on the first ballot, but he rejected the offer.</p>
<p>“I have been working every day to unify the Republican Party for the American people,” Boebert said before the vote. “And yesterday we had a deal that was not a selfish deal in any way for Kevin McCarthy, to get him the gavel on the first ballot, and he eagerly dismissed us.”</p>
<p>Boebert said one of the policy changes that is especially important to her is a single-member motion to vacate, which would allow any member of the House, not just a member of leadership, to call for a vote on the speaker.</p>
<p>“We were just told when we left this door, ‘We will give you single-member motion to vacate,’” Boebert said following the closed-door GOP meeting ahead of the floor vote.</p>
<p>Perry said the Tuesday morning meeting was “about a beat-down and a simulated unity in the room which really doesn&#8217;t exist.”</p>
<p>Perry also said anti-McCarthy Republicans are being “threatened with being kicked off your committees if you don’t vote as you’re ordered to.”</p>
<p>“We took an offer to him last night of things that are completely and wholly within his purview,” Perry said. “If he wants to accept the offer, we’re happy to join the discussion.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">D.C. ‘status quo’ criticized</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Bishop of North Carolina wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/RepDanBishop/status/1610309812180471809" target="_blank">statement</a> ahead of the vote that McCarthy is not the right candidate to be speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has perpetuated the Washington status quo that makes this body one of the most unsuccessful and unpopular institutions in the country,&#8221; Bishop said. &#8220;This is not about personality differences or who has &#8216;earned&#8217; the position. It&#8217;s about the American people.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last speaker’s election to go for more than one ballot was in 1923, when Frederick Huntington Gillett, a Massachusetts Republican, didn’t secure the gavel until the ninth ballot, <a href="https://history.house.gov/People/Office/Speakers-Multiple-Ballots/" target="_blank">according to</a> the U.S. House Office of the Historian.</p>
<p>Of the 14 speaker elections that have gone to multiple ballots, the 34th Congress, which began in 1855, held the most votes, reaching 133 before electing Nathaniel Prentice Banks to the role.</p>
<p>The U.S. House can’t begin any of its work for the 118th session of Congress until it elects a speaker, putting GOP plans for legislation on hold for the moment.</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said the House GOP will bring “meaningful, ready-to-go” legislation in the House during the first few weeks of the 118th Congress as committees “organize and start moving legislation through regular order.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — Congress unveiled a $1.7 trillion spending package </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">early Tuesday </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year, completing the annual process that began this spring when President Joe Biden sent lawmakers his budget request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s chief budget official in a statement urged Congress to speedily pass the massive measure before a Friday deadline and send it to the president. The omnibus, as it’s known, is likely to be the last significant piece of legislation lawmakers will push through during the 117th Congress.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://appropriations.house.gov/news/press-releases/delauro-releases-2023-government-funding-legislation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The package,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which includes the dozen annual appropriations bills that fund everything from the Pentagon to national parks to the Agriculture Department, also includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan bill, the Electoral Count Act, that would clarify how Congress certifies electoral votes for president;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$40</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> billion to help communities recover from natural disasters; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">45 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">billion in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would also allow — though not require — states to continue providing 12 months of postpartum care for women covered by Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program. States that have been resistant to that policy would be able to opt out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was no easy feat to piece this bill together,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday morning, before rattling off several of the package’s provisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Democrat said the “funding bill is overflowing with very good news for our troops, for the Ukrainian brave fighters, for American jobs, for our families and for American democracy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said the package &#8220;is an impressive outcome for the Republican negotiators, and more importantly it is the outcome that our country actually needs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Kentucky Republican urged his colleagues to back the measure, saying the choice between fully funding the government for the rest of the fiscal year or using another stopgap spending bill was “not a close call.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Senate should pass this bill,” McConnell said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Defense spending tops nondefense</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress must pass the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4,155</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">-page </span><a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/JRQ121922.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">package</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before Friday at midnight, when </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-clears-one-week-bill-fund-government-many-hurdles-remain" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a one-week stopgap spending bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expires, or potentially begin a partial shutdown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The omnibus package includes $858 billion in defense spending, up from $782 billion and a significant increase from the $730 billion approved during the last appropriations process for nondefense accounts, though the U.S. House and U.S. Senate were using different spending levels as of Tuesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate statements about the bill often said it would provide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $772.5 in nondefense spending, while House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said the package included $800 billion for nondefense programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nondefense funds go toward the vast majority of federal departments and agencies, including Agriculture, Homeland Security, Interior, NASA, Transportation and Veterans Affairs. Funding for defense programs predominantly goes to the Pentagon through the Defense Appropriations bill, though some of the defense money goes to nuclear programs within the Energy Department. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP internal split</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure, released </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday morning around 1:30 a.m.,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has the support of Democrats in both chambers and Senate Republicans. But House Republican leaders </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-and-senate-gop-odds-over-massive-government-spending-deal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opted to exclude themselves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the negotiations, arguing that lawmakers should wait until their party controls that chamber to finish work for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten House Republicans and three members elect sent a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/chiproytx/status/1605031549165899776" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their GOP colleagues in the Senate late Monday, calling on them to use the legislative filibuster to block the omnibus from moving forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 13 wrote that they were “obliged to inform” Republican senators that “if any omnibus passes in the remaining days of this Congress, we will oppose and whip opposition to any legislative priority of those senators who vote for this bill — including the Republican leader.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They wrote that if their Senate colleagues didn’t prevent the bill from moving forward, “there is no point in pretending we are a united party, and we must prepare for a new political reality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, North Carolina Rep. Dan Bishop, Georgia Rep. Andrew Clyde, Arizona Rep-elect Eli Crane, Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, Virginia Rep. Bob Good, Florida Rep-elect Anna Paulina Luna, Tennessee Rep-elect Andy Ogles, Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry and Montana Rep. Matt Rosendale were among those who signed the letter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said in a written statement that Congress should approve the package before the Friday midnight deadline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This process was far from perfect, but ultimately it allowed Republican redlines to be adhered to and because of that I will urge my colleagues to support this package,” Shelby said, referring to GOP demands. “We need to do our job and fund the government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House budget director Shalanda Young said in a written statement the bipartisan government funding agreement “is an important step forward, bringing both parties together to make progress on critical priorities for our country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As with any compromise, neither side got everything it wanted, but this legislation is good for our economy, our competitiveness, and our country, and I urge Congress to send it to the President’s desk without delay,” Young added. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Electoral Count Act, TikTok</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spending package includes several unrelated bills that lawmakers from both political parties have been working to get to Biden’s desk for months or years, a common feature of omnibus spending packages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The package would change the way Congress certifies electoral votes for president by reinforcing the vice president’s role as ceremonial. The measure would raise the threshold for members’ objection to certifying a state’s electoral votes to one-fifth of the Senate and one-fifth of the House from the current threshold of one member of each chamber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. House </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-bill-reforming-electoral-count-act-stop-jan-6-repeat" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved its version of the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September, and the Senate Rules and Administration Committee </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/key-us-senate-panel-advances-bill-aimed-preventing-another-jan-6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overwhelmingly approved its version</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later that month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins and West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III said in a statement Tuesday that the electoral count bill “fixes the flaws of the archaic and ambiguous Electoral Count Act of 1887 and establishes clear guidelines for our system of certifying and counting electoral votes for President and Vice President.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The package would ban the popular social media app TikTok, or any apps from its parent company ByteDance Limited or an entity owned by ByteDance Limited, from government devices. Lawmakers added an exception for “law enforcement activities, national security interests and activities, and security researchers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Senate </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-votes-bar-tiktok-government-devices-state-bans-multiply" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unanimously voted last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to send the House a bill by Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley that would have banned federal employees from downloading TikTok on their phones amid concerns about how it tracks users’ data and how much access the Chinese government has to that information. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Medicaid, CHIP</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill includes provisions that would ensure for the first time that “every child in America who qualifies for Medicaid or CHIP will now be guaranteed at least one year of continuous health coverage,” according to Schumer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a major change that will make a big difference in improving the health care for millions of kids,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure would “permanently extend a policy from the American Rescue Plan that lets states give a full year of postpartum coverage for mothers on Medicaid and CHIP,” Schumer said Tuesday.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is something huge, something I have so strongly believed in and fought for,” Schumer said. “It’s a major step to address America’s crisis in maternal health and mortality.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Maryland-Virginia spat</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also continues the federal government’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/20/will-it-be-maryland-or-virginia-feds-near-a-verdict-on-new-fbi-headquarters/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">years-long search</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/23/fbi-director-is-potential-hurdle-in-relocating-agency-to-the-suburbs-cardin-says/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">select a location </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s new headquarters after a last-minute disagreement between members from suburban Maryland and Virginia about how the process should go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The omnibus says the General Services Administration administrator “shall conduct separate and detailed consultations with individuals representing the sites from the State of Maryland and Commonwealth of Virginia” in order to ensure GSA’s criteria for selecting a site in the Washington, D.C. suburbs “is consistent with Congressional intent.” </span></p>

(Laura Olson/ States Newsroom D.C. Bureau)</p><div id="modal-ready">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is once again offering Americans the opportunity to order free at-home COVID-19 rapid tests from the federal government, a program that it had shuttered amid an ongoing stalemate with Congress over additional funding to address the virus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program will allow each household to order four free COVID-19 tests as part of the White House’s plans to try to tamp down the number of diagnoses this winter amid an increase in coronavirus, flu and RSV. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While COVID-19 is not the disruptive force it once was, the virus continues to evolve, and cases are on the rise again as families are spending more time indoors and gathering for the holidays,” the White House wrote in a fact sheet about its efforts this winter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The free COVID-19 test kits can be ordered through </span><a href="https://www.covid.gov/tests" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVIDTests.gov </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">or by calling 1-800-232-0233 between 8 a.m. and midnight Eastern. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Preparing for winter</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration’s winter preparedness plan focuses predominantly on vaccination, with proposals to hold pop-up clinics and work with governors to increase nursing home vaccination rates. Health officials also are calling on hospitals to offer patients a shot before discharging unvaccinated patients or those who aren’t up-to-date on their boosters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 267 million people, or 80% of the U.S. population, have gotten at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccination, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But those numbers decrease over time, with 229 million, or 69%, completing the two-dose primary series. And just 42 million people have gotten the updated bivalent COVID-19 vaccine that public health officials approved in September, according to </span><a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-booster-percent-pop5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekly death total from COVID-19 has remained relatively steady since mid-April, when about 3,000 Americans were dying of the virus weekly. That number dipped a bit over the summer but has stayed about the same throughout the fall and into winter. For the week of Dec. 7, another 2,981 people died of the virus, </span><a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the CDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration said its plan for the winter will continue focusing on the highest-risk people, including “residents of nursing homes and other congregate care facilities, where we know vaccination rates remain too low.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This also includes older Americans, individuals who are immunocompromised, disabled individuals, and others who face a higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19,” the White House wrote in its fact sheet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration plans to send nursing home and long-term-care facility administrators a playbook for this winter. Public health officials also called on those facilities to take “concrete actions to ensure that every resident is educated on and offered an updated COVID-19 shot; that every resident who tests positive for COVID-19 is evaluated and offered treatment; and that every facility is taking steps to improve its indoor air quality.”</span></p>

(National Park Service) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — Mayors from throughout the United States will sit down with senior Biden administration officials Friday for a half-day forum on how their cities can access resources within the COVID-19 aid bill, bipartisan infrastructure law and Democrats’ signature health care and climate change package known as the Inflation Reduction Act. </span></p>
<p>Among the 14 mayors attending the forum are <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor-elect Phillip Jones of Newport News, Virginia.</span></p>
<div id="modal-ready">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meetings, which will mostly take place at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next to the White House, are designed to help break down the hundreds of different funding programs in those “behemoth bills” and give mayors a chance to meet face-to-face with the administration leaders who can help them funnel the federal money down to their cities, officials said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As they&#8217;re coming into office, we just want to make sure that they know what resources are available to them, that they&#8217;re connected to our office and Intergovernmental Affairs and to also the agencies that are really leading so much of this important work,” said Julie Rodriguez, senior advisor and assistant to the president and director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an interview with States Newsroom on Thursday, Rodriguez said the White House wants to work with mayors in 2023 on implementing their “key legislative achievements.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also noted some of the Cabinet secretaries attending are former mayors themselves, giving them an in-depth familiarity with the process of getting access to federal resources. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, for example, who is expected to attend, is the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cabinet secretaries and senior Biden administration officials also want to hear from mayors about what issues their communities are facing and what they want from the Biden administration going forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that issues like housing are front and center for them,” Rodriguez said. “So it really was a combination of putting forward what we see as important priorities in our agenda for 2023, but also being responsive to what we know they&#8217;re dealing with on the front lines of their city, day in and day out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White House officials at the Friday meeting will include Housing &amp; Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh as well as Treasury Department Chief Recovery Officer Jacob Leibenluft, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, Rodriguez, American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling and National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rodriguez said the Biden administration wanted “a strong cross-section” of newly elected majors to attend the meeting and used that to determine which ones to invite. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They&#8217;re folks who roll up their sleeves and get things done and deliver for their constituents,” Rodriguez said. “There&#8217;s not a lot of deliberation and a lot of time to try to, you know, contemplate whether or not they&#8217;re going to fix potholes. They just got to do it.”</span></p>

(David McNew / Getty Images)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. House overwhelmingly approved a marriage equality bill Thursday that would ensure same-sex and interracial couples continue holding many of the rights they have now, should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn the cases that established those constitutional protections.</p>
<p>The measure now heads to the desk of President Joe Biden, who plans to sign it.</p>
<p><a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022513?Page=2" target="_blank">The 258-169-1 vote</a> included the backing of 39 Republicans, though many GOP lawmakers argued during debate there was no reason to pass the legislation since the justices have not agreed to take up any cases that would end legal marriages for interracial or same-sex couples.</p>
<p><a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022513?Page=2" target="_blank">All four of Virginia&#8217;s Republican congressmen</a> — Reps. Rob Wittman, Bob Good, Ben Cline and Morgan Griffith — voted against the legislation, while all six of its Democratic representatives voted in favor of it. (Virginia&#8217;s 11th representative, Democrat Donald McEachin, died last month.)</p>
<p>Virginia GOP Rep. Bob Good spoke out against the U.S. House passing the bill, saying the legislation did not comply with his religious views on marriage as a union between one man and one woman.</p>
<p>Good argued the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide was incorrect, saying the justices were “overriding the will of the people and their elected representatives.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost everything that plagues our society is a failure to follow God&#8217;s design for marriage, morality and the family,&#8221; said Good in a floor speech. &#8220;The perfect omniscient immutable God knows what he&#8217;s doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Democrats countered the legislation is essential to assure Americans that should the conservative-leaning court take up such a case in the future, as it did with abortion rights, same-sex and interracial marriages will still be recognized federally.</p>
<p>They also said religious liberty protections added in the Senate should assuage concerns about potential impacts on people and organizations.</p>
<p>“I’m standing here today because in the year 2022, families like mine are once again concerned that an activist out-of-step Supreme Court is going to take those rights away,” Minnesota Democratic Rep. Angie Craig said during floor debate.</p>
<p>Wisconsin Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan argued that his marriage to his husband, Phil, shouldn’t be any different from any other marriages when it comes to taxes, visiting a spouse in the hospital, Social Security benefits or retirement.</p>
<p>Pocan urged his colleagues, including Republicans, to back the bill, saying “it’s never too late to do the right thing.”</p>
<p>He later added that he was sure “no one here would intend to discriminate against me and my spouse, as I would never against you and yours.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Repeal of Defense of Marriage Act</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The bill approved Thursday by the U.S. House would repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act that had defined marriage as between one man and one woman. The law also allowed states to ignore legal same-sex marriages that were performed in states where the unions were legal.</p>
<p>The current measure would ensure that if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the cases that legalized same-sex and interracial marriages, the federal government will continue recognizing those unions. It would also require states to recognize legal same-sex or interracial marriages between two people performed out-of-state.</p>
<p>The U.S. House <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022373?Page=2" target="_blank">voted</a> 267-157 in July <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-protecting-right-same-sex-marriage" target="_blank">to approve the original version of the bill,</a> with 47 GOP lawmakers supporting the measure.</p>
<p>A bipartisan group of U.S. senators — Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat; Susan Collins, a Maine Republican; Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican; Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat; and Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican — then began working behind the scenes to add religious liberty protections into the bill and to get the backing of at least 10 Republicans to clear that chamber’s legislative filibuster.</p>
<p>After a few months of negotiations, senators <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00362.htm" target="_blank">voted</a> 61-36 in late November <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-passes-bill-protecting-same-sex-marriage" target="_blank">to send the measure back to the House</a> for final approval.</p>
<p>Following Senate passage of the bill, Biden said in a written statement that “the United States is on the brink of reaffirming a fundamental truth: love is love, and Americans should have the right to marry the person they love.”</p>
<p>“For millions of Americans, this legislation will safeguard the rights and protections to which LGBTQI+ and interracial couples and their children are entitled,” Biden wrote. “It will also ensure that, for generations to follow, LGBTQI+ youth will grow up knowing that they, too, can lead full, happy lives and build families of their own.”</p>

<p>The 61-36 bipartisan vote sends the bill back to the U.S. House, where lawmakers expect to give it their final stamp of approval soon, before sending it to President Joe Biden. The House <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022373?Page=2" target="_blank">voted</a> 267-157 in July <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-protecting-right-same-sex-marriage" target="_blank">to approve the original bill</a> but must vote again after a bipartisan group of senators added in religious liberty protections.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, wore the same tie Tuesday he wore to his daughter’s wedding and recounted a conversation he had with his daughter and her wife following the death of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p>
<p>“I remember that awful feeling around the dinner table and I distinctly remember the question my daughter and her wife asked, ‘Could our right to marry be undone?’” Schumer said.</p>
<p>“It’s a scary, but necessary acknowledgment that despite all the progress we’ve made, the constitutional right to same-sex marriage is not even a decade old and exists only by the virtue of a very narrow 5-4 Supreme Court decision,” Schumer continued. “And we all know the court has changed since that decision.”</p>
<p>Retiring Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, retiring North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, West Virginia’s Shelley Moore Capito, Maine’s Susan Collins, Iowa’s Joni Ernst, Wyoming’s Cynthia Lummis, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, retiring Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, Utah’s Mitt Romney, Alaska’s Dan Sullivan, North Carolina&#8217;s Thom Tillis and Indiana’s Todd Young voted for the bill.</p>
<p>Both of Virginia&#8217;s Democratic senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, voted in favor of the bill.</p>
<p class="m_4947154235943870748wordsection1">“Marriage is not only a spiritual bond between two individuals, it’s also a binding contract that cements essential benefits, rights, and privileges,&#8221; Warner wrote in a statement following the vote. &#8220;This bill will ensure that gay marriages are recognized across the country, thereby protecting same-sex couples from discrimination that would otherwise block their access to health care, paid family medical leave, hospital visitation, and parental rights — among many others.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Repeal of Defense of Marriage Act</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The legislation would repeal the 1996 law known as the Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as the union of one man and one woman. The federal law also allowed states to ignore same-sex unions legally performed in other states.</p>
<p>The new law would ensure that if the U.S. Supreme Court were to overturn the cases that have legalized same-sex and interracial marriages, the federal government would continue to recognize those unions, a step necessary for hundreds of federal benefits including Social Security and veterans benefits.</p>
<p>The bill, known as the Respect for Marriage Act, would require states to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages performed in states that keep the unions legal, though it wouldn’t require states to keep same-sex or interracial marriages legal if the U.S. Supreme Court were to overturn those cases.</p>
<p>Cathryn Oakley, Human Rights Campaign state legislative director and senior counsel, said during a briefing in mid-November the bill is a “very important” part of the legislation LGBTQ rights advocates have been pressing Congress to pass for years.</p>
<p>She also sought to clarify misconceptions the legislation will allow any two people to enter a same-sex or interracial marriage anywhere in the country should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn the cases protecting those rights.</p>
<p>“Congress has done everything in this bill that it can responsibly do,” Oakley said. “What they do not have the ability to responsibly do, is to tell states that they must marry two people of the same sex.”</p>
<p>Oakley said U.S. lawmakers “are taking the maximum responsible action that they can take at this point” under the powers they have within the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State bans</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>More than 30 states have constitutional amendments, state laws or both that ban same-sex marriages, <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10866" target="_blank">according to</a> the Congressional Research Service. &#8220;Many states still have unenforceable constitutional amendments or state statutes that ban marriage for same-sex couples,&#8221; the report said.</p>
<p>Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin are among the states with state constitutional amendments that would prohibit same-sex marriages.</p>
<p>Under Democratic control, Virginia in 2021 began the multiyear process of removing its defunct ban from the state constitution, but Republicans blocked the change earlier this year after retaking control of the House of Delegates.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. Republicans block effort to scrap 2006 gay marriage ban&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/va-republicans-block-effort-to-scrap-2006-gay-marriage-ban/embed/#?secret=Sn1PWgf5ZN#?secret=NrYKD4VNKQ" data-secret="NrYKD4VNKQ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>Indiana and Pennsylvania are among the states with laws that would prohibit same-sex marriages. The Iowa Supreme Court overturned Iowa&#8217;s ban in April 2009, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>Those laws and state constitutional provisions are currently unenforceable under the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling that established same-sex marriages as protected under the Constitution. But they could go into effect again were the justices to overturn that case. States that still have laws banning interracial marriages on the books cannot enforce those laws under the 1967 Loving v. Virginia ruling.</p>
<p>Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft criticized his state’s senior senator, Blunt, for voting for the legislation, saying he was &#8220;flabbergasted&#8221; by the move and noting that the state’s constitutional amendment bars the unions.</p>
<p>Ashcroft said during <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/11/29/ashcroft-criticizes-blunt-support-for-senate-bill-protecting-same-sex-marriage/" target="_blank">an interview with The Missouri Independent</a> that he tried to call Blunt to lobby him in opposition to the bill but had been unable to reach him, so he sent a letter instead.</p>
<p>The legislation the U.S. Senate approved Tuesday was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision this summer to overturn the two cases that kept abortion legal nationwide, protected as a constitutional right, for nearly half a century.</p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas sparked concern when he wrote in his concurring opinion in the abortion case that the justices “should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents” that included similar legal reasoning as the abortion cases.</p>
<p>Thomas listed Griswold v. Connecticut, the case that established married couples have a constitutional right to decide if and how to use birth control; Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 case that legalized same-sex marriage; and Lawrence v. Texas, which overturned state anti-sodomy laws, as three cases he specifically thought the court should revisit.</p>
<p>LGBTQ rights advocates immediately called on Congress to ensure that any future Supreme Court rulings wouldn’t completely erode marriage rights.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans on board</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. House approved the legislation in July, and the U.S. Senate was on track to vote on the marriage equality bill before the November midterm elections, but Schumer held off at the request of a bipartisan group of senators who added religious liberty language and were working to get at least 10 Republicans on board to pass the chamber’s legislative filibuster.</p>
<p>Sens. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat; Collins; Portman; Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat; and Tillis wrote at the time they were “confident that when our legislation comes to the Senate floor for a vote, we will have the bipartisan support to pass the bill.”</p>
<p>The religious liberty protections now in the bill would protect “all religious liberty and conscience protections available under the Constitution or Federal law,” according to a summary of the changes.</p>
<p>The legislation would insulate religious organizations, certain religious nonprofits and their employees from being required “to provide services, accommodations, advantages, facilities, goods, or privileges for the solemnization or celebration of a marriage.”</p>
<p>It would prevent changes to tax-exempt status since “a church, university, or other nonprofit’s eligibility for tax-exempt status is unrelated to marriage, so its status would not be affected by this legislation,” according to the summary.</p>
<p>The bill passed its first procedural <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00356.htm" target="_blank">vote</a> in the Senate in mid-November when <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/bill-protecting-same-sex-marriage-gains-bipartisan-support-us-senate" target="_blank">12 GOP senators joined Democrats to move past the legislative filibuster.</a></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP amendments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Before the Senate approved the bill Tuesday, lawmakers voted down three Republican amendments.</p>
<p>Senators voted 48-49 to reject a proposal from Utah Sen. Mike Lee that would have barred the federal government from taking &#8220;any discriminatory action,&#8221; like eliminating a tax benefit, for any person who &#8220;speaks, or acts, in accordance with a sincerely held religious belief, or moral conviction, that marriage is&#8221; between one man and one woman or two individuals as recognized under federal law.</p>
<p>Lee argued ahead of the vote that lawmakers “would do a disservice to all Americans if we elevate the rights of one group at the expense of another.”</p>
<p>Liberty University, a private evangelical university in Lynchburg, Virginia that is one of the nation&#8217;s largest nonprofit universities, ahead of the vote sent an email to students urging them to call their representatives and tell them to vote in favor of the Lee amendment.</p>
<p>Calling the Respect for Marriage Act &#8220;a smoke-screen&#8221; and &#8220;very deceptive,&#8221; the email from Interim President Jerry Prevo told recipients that the law &#8220;fails to protect those of us who believe marriage is between a man and a woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty did not respond to questions from the Mercury about the email.</p>
<p>The Senate voted 45-52 to reject a proposal from Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford that would have changed who was required to comply with the law from any person acting under “color of state law” to a state, territory or tribe.</p>
<p>Lankford said Tuesday that the “color of state law” language could refer to any organization that a state contracts with to perform a government function, such as private prisons, adoption agencies, foster care agencies or homeless shelters.</p>
<p>Lankford&#8217;s amendment would have also removed a section of the bill that would allow people &#8220;harmed&#8221; by a violation of the law to sue. Lankford said the legislation didn&#8217;t define what “harmed” would mean.</p>
<p>Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s amendment to eliminate the section of the bill that would allow anyone “harmed by a violation” of the law to sue in a U.S. district court was rejected following a 45-52 vote.</p>
<p>Rubio argued in a written statement that while the legislation included language that “would protect nonprofits whose ‘principal purpose’ is the ‘study, practice, or advancement of religion,’ it would not protect other faith-based organizations.”</p>
<p>Baldwin urged senators to reject the three amendments ahead of the vote, saying they would “upend the months of good-faith negotiations and they would disrupt our carefully crafted bipartisan compromise.”</p>
<p>The religious liberty language added to the bill, Baldwin said, ensures protection for “religious liberties afforded under our Constitution and federal law.”</p>
<p>“We are not pushing this legislation to make history,” she said. “We are doing this to make a difference for millions upon millions of Americans.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON —  The U.S. Senate cleared a key hurdle to passing a marriage equality bill Wednesday, garnering even more than the 60 senators from both political parties needed to move past a legislative filibuster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill, which could win final passage in the Senate as soon as this week, would ensure same-sex and interracial couples continue having their marriages recognized regardless of future Supreme Court rulings. The U.S. House passed the measure earlier this year but will need to vote once more after the Senate changed the bill to include a so-called religious liberty amendment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1172/vote_117_2_00356.htm" target="_blank">The 62-37 Senate procedural vote</a> Wednesday drew the backing of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Republicans, including retiring Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, retiring North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, West Virginia’s Shelley Moore Capito, Maine’s Susan Collins, Iowa’s Joni Ernst, Wyoming’s Cynthia Lummis, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, retiring Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, Utah’s Mitt Romney, Alaska’s Dan Sullivan, North Carolina&#8217;s Thom Tillis and Indiana’s Todd Young.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin said during floor debate that millions of Americans are concerned the Supreme Court could overturn the cases that guaranteed the right to same-sex or interracial marriages, similar to how it ended the constitutional right to abortion this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s face it, regardless of your position on the issue of abortion, the highest court of the land has just overturned a precedent of nearly 50 years. There’s no questioning that,” Baldwin said. “And the same legal arguments the Supreme Court rested on to reverse Roe v. Wade could just as easily be applied to reverse numerous other cases related to families, related to intimate relations, to contraception and marriage.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baldwin said some of her colleagues have questioned why Congress needs to pass the marriage equality bill, known as the Respect for Marriage Act, now, given that “there’s no case currently making its way up to the United States Supreme Court challenging these rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Others have suggested that proponents of the Respect for Marriage Act are raising attention just to drive further divisions among Americans,” Baldwin said. But, she added, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe there is an urgency to pass the Respect for Marriage Act in order to heal such divisions and provide certainty to married interracial and same-sex couples that the protections, rights and responsibilities that flow from their marriages will endure.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of Virginia&#8217;s Democratic senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, voted in favor of moving the bill forward.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maine’s Collins said the bill “would help promote equality, prevent discrimination and protect the rights of Americans in same-sex and interracial marriages.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure, Collins said, would maintain and strengthen “important religious liberty and conscience protections” as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let us remember that we are talking about our family members, our friends, our co-workers, our neighbors,” Collins said. “I’m proud to have stood with them and I will continue to stand with them in efforts to protect and secure their rights, while at the same time steadfastly protecting and respecting religious liberty.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ernst said following the vote that it took her &#8220;a lot of time&#8221; and a lot of conversations before deciding how she&#8217;d vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Iowa was the fourth state where same-sex marriage was allowed, and so we&#8217;re maintaining the status quo,&#8221; Ernst said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Biden administration publicly backed the bill Wednesday as the vote was ongoing, releasing a statement of administration policy saying &#8220;the right to marriage confers vital legal protections, dignity, and full participation in our society.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No person should face discrimination because of who they are or whom they love, and every married couple in the United States deserves the security of knowing that their marriage will be defended and respected,&#8221; it said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An issue after abortion rights ruling</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The marriage equality legislation was set in motion this summer following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marriage equality supporters, as well as several others, were concerned with a section of Associate Justice Clarence Thomas’ concurring opinion where he wrote the justices “should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents” that included similar legal reasoning as the abortion cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas specifically listed Griswold v. Connecticut, a case that said married couples had the constitutional right to decide if and how to use birth control; Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 case that legalized same-sex marriage; and Lawrence v. Texas, which overturned state anti-sodomy laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. House </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-bipartisan-vote-passes-bill-protecting-right-same-sex-marriage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 267-157 in July to send the legislation to the U.S. Senate, where it stalled out as backers worked on the religious liberty amendment and towards securing at least 10 Republicans to support the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That support came Wednesday when 62 senators voted for what’s technically known as the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed. It can also be called the legislative filibuster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 federal law that defines marriage as between one man and one woman. That law has been invalid for more than seven years but is still on the books. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure would ensure that if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its prior same-sex marriage rulings, or the 1967 Loving v. Virginia decision that legalized interracial marriages, states and the federal government would need to recognize those marriages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that were to happen, state governments could make the unions illegal within their borders, requiring same-sex or interracial couples to travel to a state where it is legal in order to wed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those home states would, however, need to recognize the marriages under the new bill, as would the federal government. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Religious liberty language</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new religious liberty language was added to the bill following months of behind-the-scenes negotiations between Wisconsin’s Baldwin, Maine’s Collins, Ohio’s Portman, Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and North Carolina’s Tillis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The addition, which is now part of the bill without getting a separate amendment vote, would protect “all religious liberty and conscience protections available under the Constitution or Federal law,” according to a summary of the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation says religious organizations, certain religious nonprofits and their employees “shall not be required to provide services, accommodations, advantages, facilities, goods, or privileges for the solemnization or celebration of a marriage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new language would ensure no changes to tax-exempt status since “a church, university, or other nonprofit’s eligibility for tax-exempt status is unrelated to marriage, so its status would not be affected by this legislation,” according to a summary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human Rights Campaign Interim President Joni Madison said in a statement released Monday that the bipartisan bill means “the U.S. Senate has the opportunity to right a historic wrong, creating an inclusive law that reflects the will of the vast majority of Americans — 71% of whom support marriage equality — and eases the minds of those who may worry what the impact of the Dobbs decision could mean for their marriages.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — Voters in five states — including GOP-dominated Kentucky — backed abortion rights Tuesday, signaling that while the U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority no longer believes the procedure is protected within the U.S. Constitution, many Americans want their states to do just that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont residents voted to support abortion access or boost reproductive rights when asked about the issue directly on their ballots this year. Kansans also </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/kansas-voters-defeat-abortion-amendment-unexpected-landslide" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backed abortion rights </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this year, when nearly 60% of voters said they wanted to keep abortion protected under the state’s constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The outcome in red states like Kansas and Kentucky as well as </span><a href="https://michiganadvance.com/2022/11/09/michigan-voters-ok-abortion-voting-rights-and-term-limits-proposals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a swing state like Michigan</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">shows that while Republican voters may want conservative candidates in office, they may not necessarily want abortion rights to be reduced further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the votes show that abortion access is &#8220;not a partisan issue” and that people throughout the country “do not want politicians controlling their bodies and futures.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across the country last night, we saw an unmistakable repudiation of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe,&#8221; Northup said in a written statement. “From Kentucky to Michigan to Vermont to California, Americans want their right to abortion protected.”</span></p>
<p>In Virginia, women largely have unrestricted access to abortion in the first and second trimesters under current law, with abortion in the third trimester allowed only when three doctors determine continuing the pregnancy poses a severe threat to the mother.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers have already announced plans to propose <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/24/youngkin-vows-to-protect-life-as-supreme-court-overturns-right-to-abortion/" target="_blank">a 15-week abortion ban</a> during the upcoming 2023 General Assembly session, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin has said he would support the move. State Sen. Amanda Chase, R-Chesterfield, recently also said she will <a href="https://www.cbs19news.com/story/47603097/state-senator-proposes-abortion-ban" target="_blank">introduce legislation to ban abortion in Virginia entirely</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In California, more than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">65% </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of voters in the solidly Democratic state backed amending the state’s constitution to say lawmakers “cannot deny or interfere with a person’s reproductive freedom&#8221; and &#8220;people have the fundamental right to choose” if and when to use contraceptives or get an abortion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That number was significantly higher than the 59% of voters who supported U.S. Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla’s reelection or the 58% of Californians who backed Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting against the California ballot question wouldn’t have eliminated abortion access in the state, since the state Supreme Court has ruled the state constitution’s right to privacy includes reproductive choices like contraceptive use and abortion. But it did indicate some voters who didn’t support Democratic candidates do support abortion rights remaining secure. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Kentucky question</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifty-two percent </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of Kentucky voters rejected a ballot question that would have amended their state constitution to say that “to protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kentucky voters similarly backed statewide candidates by different margins, reelecting Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul with 62% of the vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">D. Stephen Voss, associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky, said Wednesday that nationally and in the Bluegrass State, “not a small number of genuine Republican voters are still pro-choice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During past elections, Voss said, one of the GOP’s strongest platforms was on abortion, allowing “them to hold together voters in areas where their economic policies, their more class-based policies, weren&#8217;t doing them as much good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at the so-called ticket splitting where voters backed GOP candidates but also supported abortion rights on ballot questions, Voss said, “mathematically it&#8217;s clear that a lot of people who supported Republican politicians nonetheless cast a vote against the abortion limitations.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”This last election cycle underscores that the abortion issue is no longer advantageous turf for the GOP,” Voss said. “It&#8217;s become a strength for Democrats in some places. So Republicans are going to have to figure out how to adjust their policy demands to improve their electoral prospects in light of this quick change in the politics of abortion.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Michigan amendment backed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Michigan, voters backed adding an amendment to the state constitution that would create a “new individual right to reproductive freedom, including [the] right to make and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">carry out all decisions about pregnancy, such as prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">care, contraception, sterilization, abortion, miscarriage management, and infertility.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ballot question said the state government would be able to regulate abortion after fetal viability, typically between 22 and 24 weeks, “but not prohibit if medically needed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to protect a patient’s life or physical or mental health.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 56% of Michigan voters supported protecting those rights under their state constitution. The results show more ticket splitting, with 54% of voters reelecting Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Montana voters reject ‘legal person’ ballot question</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Montana, 52% of voters rejected establishing a state law that a “born-alive infant, including an infant born in the course of an abortion, must be treated as a legal person under the laws of the state, with the same rights to medically appropriate and reasonable care and treatment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion is legal in Montana through viability, and the state Supreme Court has said the state constitution protects the right to end a pregnancy as part of the right to privacy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ballot question voters weighed in on Tuesday was largely seen as a referendum on abortion rights in the state, with anti-abortion advocates backing the provision to require a doctor to save the life of a viable fetus delivered as part of an abortion “while medical providers said the situation doesn’t happen and only makes care of medically complicated pregnancies more difficult,” </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/montanas-statewide-results-trickle-digital-privacy-amendment-seems-certain" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to The Daily Montanan.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ballot question was unnecessary since Congress passed and then-President George W. Bush signed a </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/107th-congress/house-bill/2175/text" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2002 that defined &#8220;person,&#8221; &#8220;human being,&#8221; &#8220;child&#8221; and &#8220;individual&#8221; to include every “infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal law then defines “born alive” as “the complete expulsion or extraction from his or her mother of that member, at any stage of development, who after such expulsion or extraction breathes or has a beating heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut, and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Montana didn’t have any statewide candidate races this year, voters overwhelmingly reelected Republican U.S. Rep. Matt Rosendale with 57% of the vote in the 2nd District. And voters appeared on track to elect Republican ​​Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior during the Trump administration, to the newly formed 1st Congressional District with 50% of the vote, though the Associated Press had yet to call the race Wednesday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Vermont ballot question wins big</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Vermont, more than 77% of voters supported a ballot question that enshrined “reproductive autonomy” in the state’s constitution.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That figure was much higher than the 69% of Vermonters who backed Democratic Rep. Peter Welch’s first bid for U.S. Senate, following the retirement of U.S. Sen. Pat Leahy. It was more than the 71% of voters who reelected Republican Gov. Phil Scott. And it was higher than the 63% of voters who elected Democratic state Sen. Becca Balint to the state’s at-large U.S. House seat.</span></p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat who has a U.S. Capitol Police security detail, was in Washington, D.C. at the time, according to a statement from the U.S. Capitol Police, who have joined the investigation along with the FBI.</p>
<p>San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said during a press conference that David Depape, 42, has been charged with attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon and elder abuse and will likely face several other felony charges.</p>
<p>Scott said that around 2:27 a.m. Friday, San Francisco police officers were dispatched to the Pelosi residence for a wellbeing check.</p>
<p>“Our officers observed Mr. Pelosi and the suspect both holding a hammer,” Scott said. “The suspect pulled a hammer away from Mr. Pelosi and violently assaulted him with it.”</p>
<p>The police officers then tackled Depape, disarmed him, took him into custody, requested emergency backup and provided first aid, Scott said.</p>
<p>Both Depape and Pelosi were taken to a local hospital.</p>
<p>Scott said the motive for the attack is still being determined. He then declined to take any questions following his statement.</p>
<p>Pelosi spokesman Hammill said in the statement released Friday morning that Paul Pelosi “is receiving excellent medical care and is expected to make a full recovery.”</p>
<p>“The Speaker and her family are grateful to the first responders and medical professionals involved, and request privacy at this time,” he added.</p>
<p>CNN and several other news organizations <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/politics/paul-pelosi-attack" target="_blank">reported</a> Friday that Depape tried to tie up Paul Pelosi and said he was “waiting for Nancy.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Capitol Police said in its statement that an investigation has been launched.</p>
<p>“Special Agents with the USCP’s California Field Office quickly arrived on scene, while a team of investigators from the Department’s Threat Assessment Section was simultaneously dispatched from the East Coast to assist the FBI and the San Francisco Police with a joint investigation,” USCP said in a statement.</p>
<p>Both President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, spoke with Speaker Pelosi Friday morning following the attack.</p>
<p>Schumer said in a statement the attack on Paul Pelosi was “a dastardly act.”</p>
<p>“I spoke with Speaker Pelosi earlier this morning and conveyed my deepest concern and heartfelt wishes to her husband and their family, and I wish him a speedy recovery,” Schumer said.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement that Biden was praying for the Pelosi family and that he is “very glad that a full recovery is expected.”</p>
<p>“The President continues to condemn all violence, and asks that the family’s desire for privacy be respected,” Jean-Pierre added.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, tweeted Friday that he was “horrified and disgusted” by the attack.</p>
<p>“Grateful to hear that Paul is on track to make a full recovery and that law enforcement including our stellar Capitol Police are on the case.” McConnell said.</p>
<p>While campaigning for congressional contender Yesli Vega Friday, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin mentioned the attack on Paul Pelosi and <a href="https://twitter.com/therecount/status/1586060529767956481" target="_blank">told the crowd</a>, &#8220;There&#8217;s no room for violence anywhere, but we&#8217;re going to send (Nancy Pelosi) back to be with him in California.&#8221;</p>

<p>Republicans unhappy about government spending could move to shut down the government, a tactic unsuccessful for the GOP in past battles over Obamacare and the Trump border wall. Their potential refusal to adjust the debt limit could bring the nation to the verge of a damaging default, economic experts say.</p>
<p>The debt limit, currently set at $31.4 trillion, allows the Treasury Department to borrow money in order to pay all of the nation’s bills in full and on time. When the federal government nears that limit, likely in the second half of 2023, it can either raise it to a new spending level or suspend it through a certain date.</p>
<p>Taking no action — and thus defaulting on the debt — would mean the U.S. government has no more borrowing authority and can only spend what it brings in through taxes and other revenue streams.</p>
<p>That would lead to unprecedented cuts and would likely affect payments for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid as well as hundreds of other federal programs, along with a tide of economic repercussions.</p>
<p>U.S. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, who hopes to become speaker if the GOP regains control of the House, <a href="https://punchbowl.news/archive/101822-punchbowl-news-am/" target="_blank">told Punchbowl News</a> last week that he&#8217;s likely to leverage the debt limit for reductions in federal spending.</p>
<p>“You can’t just continue down the path to keep spending and adding to the debt,” the California Republican said. “And if people want to make a debt ceiling [for a longer period of time], just like anything else, there comes a point in time where, okay, we’ll provide you more money, but you got to change your current behavior. We’re not just going to keep lifting your credit card limit, right? And we should seriously sit together and [figure out] where can we eliminate some waste? Where can we make the economy grow stronger?”</p>
<p>When asked if spending cuts would need to include changes to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, McCarthy said he didn’t want to “predetermine” negotiations.</p>
<p>Republicans are projected to regain control of the U.S. House following the midterm elections, though whether they’ll become the majority in the Senate is less clear.</p>
<p>The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter changed its prediction for House control this week from Republicans gaining 10 to 20 seats to the GOP picking up 12 to 25 seats.</p>
<p>The future of the 50-50 Senate is less clear, with the Cook Political Report rating three seats held by Democrats and two held by Republicans as “toss ups.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Past standoffs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>One result of a stalemate over government spending could be a government shutdown at some point in 2023<b>, </b>a move the GOP has used in the past to try to get its way.</p>
<p>Republicans, however, have never pushed the country past the debt limit and into default, a move that would likely send the stock market and the world economy into a tailspin. But they pushed up close to the line in a debt limit crisis in 2011, during the Obama presidency, leading S&amp;P to downgrade the nation’s credit rating to AA-plus.</p>
<p>During the Trump administration, lawmakers from both political parties voted three times to suspend the debt limit. Congress <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/33/actions" target="_blank">voted on the debt limit once</a> during the Biden presidency, raising it by $2.5 trillion on a mostly party-line vote in December 2021. Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger was the sole Republican in Congress to vote to raise the limit.</p>
<p>The renewed debate about government spending and the debt limit follows record trillion-dollar spending during both the Trump administration and under President Joe Biden, pushing the nation’s debt upward.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No specifics yet</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Republicans have not been clear about what government spending should be reduced.</p>
<p>They so far have not released a detailed plan for exactly what federal departments would see funding cuts, or how they might attempt to alter the fastest drivers of federal spending — Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.</p>
<p>With days to go ahead of the Nov. 8 midterm elections, Democrats are calling the GOP’s proposed strategy irresponsible.</p>
<p>“The Republicans have made it clear that if they win control of the Congress, they will shut down the government, refuse to pay our bills, and it’ll be the first time in our history America will default unless I yield and cut Social Security and Medicare. Flat-out saying that,” Biden said this week at a Democratic National Committee event.</p>
<p>“In order to cut Social Security and Medicare, they’re threatening to default on the federal debt,” Biden added. “There’s nothing — nothing that will create more chaos, more inflation, and more damage to the American economy than this.”</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said in a written statement, “The debt limit is a phony issue, and it is appalling and dangerous that Congressional Republicans continue to threaten holding the U.S. economy hostage to slash Social Security and Medicare. The United States’ full faith and credit must not be used as a political pawn.”</p>
<p>But not all Republicans, including some crucial leaders like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have weighed in on supporting the idea. A spokesman for McConnell declined to say if the Kentucky Republican supports a showdown over the debt limit.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What happens in a shutdown</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Government shutdowns<b>, </b>so far kept separate from debt limit battles<b>, </b>are hugely problematic for the federal government, which sends non-exempt employees home without pay and requires exempt employees to work without getting a paycheck.</p>
<p>A shutdown cannot begin at any time, but must line up with a funding deadline.</p>
<p>The federal government runs on a fiscal year that ends on Sept. 30, making that the most predictable deadline for negotiations. Congress, though, typically passes a short-term spending package that covers the period through mid-December to work out a bipartisan agreement on spending levels and the dozen spending bills.</p>
<p>This year that deadline is Dec. 16, during the lame duck session of Congress, a typical maneuver that both political parties have used in the past.</p>
<p>If Republicans and Democrats can’t agree on a full-year spending package to fund the government through Sept. 30, 2023, they’ll have to pass another stopgap spending bill, setting up a new fiscal cliff and the opportunity for a shutdown sometime next year.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Obamacare, border wall episodes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Aside from hitting federal operations and employees, government shutdowns have a negative impact on the economy as well.</p>
<p>A 16-day shutdown over Obamacare in 2013 reduced fourth-quarter real GDP growth throughout the country between 0.2 and 0.6 percentage points, or between $2 and $6 billion, according to a <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/reports/impacts-and-costs-of-october-2013-federal-government-shutdown-report.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p>Republicans also didn’t repeal the 2010 health care law they were frustrated with.</p>
<p>During the Trump administration there was a relatively uneventful two-day shutdown that began on Jan. 20, 2018. A more significant 34-day partial government shutdown began on Dec. 22, 2018, over Trump’s hope Congress would provide more funding to build his proposed wall at the Mexico border.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s budget request for that fiscal year asked Congress for $1.6 billion for 65 miles of “border wall system,&#8221; which the Senate Appropriations Committee later approved on a bipartisan 26-5 vote.</p>
<p>Trump then upped his request to $5 billion, leading to the longest partial government shutdown in the nation’s history.</p>
<p>The spending package Congress approved afterward included $1.375 billion for 55 miles of barriers along the U.S. Mexico border.</p>
<p>That shutdown affected 800,000 federal employees, many of whom live in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs outside of Washington, D.C, according to an <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-01/54937-PartialShutdownEffects.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> from the Congressional Budget Office. While federal workers were paid later, private businesses lost money, the analysis said.</p>
<p>The episode also reduced GDP in the fourth quarter of 2018 by $3 billion and by $8 billion during the first quarter of 2019, according to CBO.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Defaulting on the debt</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The impact of walking up to a default on the nation’s debt, or actually defaulting for the first time in the country’s history, would be much more significant than a government shutdown.</p>
<p>Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said the way Congress has approached raising or suspending the debt limit during the past decade or so is “unconstructive, risky, and dangerous.”</p>
<p>He also noted that fights over the debt limit haven’t had the impact that many policymakers have claimed they would.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve gotten no net deficit reduction from debt limit deals over the past decade,” Akabas said. “In fact, more often than not, they&#8217;re being used to increase deficits: ‘You get a little more of your spending, we get a little more of our spending, and we call it a day.’”</p>
<p>“​​And that&#8217;s of course not the purpose that they have in mind for it,” he added.</p>
<p>Following the 2011 debt limit debacle, Congress passed and then-President Barack Obama signed the so-called Budget Control Act, intended to hold down increases to defense and domestic discretionary spending for a full decade.</p>
<p>But lawmakers have regularly passed spending cap deals to raise those “austere” spending limits, bolstered by votes from both Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>Political fights over the debt limit in the past have led to dire warnings about the severe consequences for the world economy.</p>
<p>“Global financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government’s finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it,” Moody&#8217;s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi and Assistant Director Bernard Yaros wrote in a September 2021 <a href="https://www.speaker.gov/sites/speaker.house.gov/files/9.21.21%20--%20Playing%20a%20Dangerous%20Game%20With%20the%20Debt%20Limit%20-%20Zandi.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> released amid the last round of brinkmanship on the debt limit.</p>
<p>“To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase,” they added. “That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Effect of default on states</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>State governments would be significantly affected by a default on the debt as well, according to a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a center-left think tank.</p>
<p>Deputy Director of Research Whitney Tucker wrote in a <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/9-30-21sfp.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from September 2021 that the federal government would need to cut spending by $1.2 trillion during that fiscal year if Congress failed to suspend or raise the debt limit.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the cuts, she wrote, “would be stunning” and would likely force reductions in programs that “help states provide health care, education, and other services.”</p>
<p>Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for the Obama administration, <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonfurman/status/1584621607451885568" target="_blank">wrote</a> this week that the “odds of something worse than the 2011 brinksmanship are higher than ever before and the consequences would be even worse than before.”</p>
<p>He then called on Democrats in Congress to use the budget reconciliation process, which gets around the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, to raise the nation’s borrowing limit to $100 quintillion before this session of Congress ends — a figure so high it would essentially eliminate the debt limit.</p>
<p>If Congress waits until next year to address the debt limit, when Republicans are expected to control at least one chamber, Furman warned that debt limit fights could lead to a “more serious, much worse” situation than what took place in the United States in 2011 when the nation’s credit was downgraded.</p>
<p>“The situation could be riskier than 2011 because although the GOP leaders today, like then, understand that default would be terrible, their caucuses are even less governable,” Furman wrote. “Add in the possibility of candidate Trump telling them not to compromise and it could (be) very difficult.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — Roughly 9.4 million Americans have already voted in the midterm elections, casting a combination of in-person early votes and mail-in ballots, according to data compiled by the United States Elections Project.</p>
<p>Florida as well as Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the top states in terms of early voting so far.</p>
<p>The initiative, headed up by University of Florida Professor Michael McDonald, shows that within states releasing data, 2.6 million people have voted in person while 6.8 million have returned mail-in ballots. Another 41.6 million voters have requested mail-in ballots, according to the <a href="https://rpubs.com/ElectProject/early_vote_2022" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>
<p>According to data drawn by the initiative from the Virginia Public Access Project, more than 245,000 early votes and 165,000 mail-in ballots had been cast in Virginia as of Oct. 24.</p>
<p>The 17 states reporting data that also share party affiliation show that of the roughly 5.1 million Americans in those states who voted early, 50% are Democrats, 30% are Republicans and 20% are not part of either party or are registered with another political affiliation.</p>
<p>McDonald noted Tuesday that in Florida, Republican in-person early voters outnumbered Democrats, 56,000 to 34,000.</p>
<p>“This is not just a function of which counties offered in-person early voting,” McDonald <a href="https://twitter.com/ElectProject/status/1584919493113176064" target="_blank">wrote</a>. “Even in some blue counties like Palm Beach, more Republicans voted in-person early.”</p>

<p>He added that since many Democrats have mail-in ballot requests carried over from the 2020 elections, “it may be that Democrats who might have voted in-person early already voted by mail or plan to vote by mail.”</p>
<p>If the trend of more Republicans voting early in person in Florida continues through the end of early voting, McDonald wrote that he would “be extremely confident in predicting DeSantis and Rubio victories.”</p>
<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, both Republicans, are seeking reelection to their current offices this November.</p>
<p>Florida voters have cast nearly 1.3 million early votes, with 42% from those registered as Democrats, 40% from Republicans and 18% from people without a party registration or with a minor party registration.</p>
<p>In Georgia, just under 1 million voters have already cast their votes, with 54% of those coming from female voters and 45% from men. The state’s breakdown of race and ethnicity, information not all states disclose, shows 56% of early voters so far are white non-Hispanic and 32% are Black non-Hispanic voters.</p>
<p>Another 1.5% of early voters in Georgia identify as Hispanic and 1.5% as Asian American.</p>
<p>Michigan voters have cast more than 700,000 early votes, either in person or via mail-in ballots, according to the project.</p>
<p>Of those voters, 62% are over age 65. People between 41 and 65 account for 30% of early votes cast, with people between 26 and 40 making up nearly 6% of early votes.</p>
<p>Women make up 56% of Michigan’s early voters up to this point, with men accounting for 44%.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, residents of the Keystone State have cast 635,000 early votes. An overwhelming 73% of those votes came from Democrats, with Republicans casting 19% so far. The remaining 8% of early voters come from people not registered as Democrat or Republican, or who affiliate with a minor political party.</p>

<p>However, experts caution that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data broken down by race and ethnicity show the percent of cases affecting Black people increasing, while there’s been a decrease among Hispanic and Latino people and a flattening out among white individuals. That data, however, is not complete, leaving out more than 30% of cases.</p>
<p>Overall, cases of monkeypox within the United States appear to have peaked in early August, about two and a half months after the first case of this outbreak was diagnosed in mid-May, sparking a nationwide vaccination drive that’s <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senators-criticize-federal-health-officials-lagging-monkeypox-response" target="_blank">been criticized</a> by public health experts and members of Congress.</p>
<p>But those vaccination efforts, combined with a massive education campaign about the virus and behavioral changes by those most at risk, appear to largely have had the intended effect.</p>
<p>The seven-day daily average of new cases crested at 443 on Aug. 6 before steadily falling to 265 on Sept. 6 and then 79 on Oct. 6, according to<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/mpx-trends.html" target="_blank"> data</a> from the CDC.</p>
<p>During the six-month outbreak, 27,500 Americans were diagnosed with monkeypox, which often presents with a rash as well as fever, tiredness, chills, itching, headache, swollen lymph nodes and muscle aches in a majority of cases reported to the CDC. As of Oct. 18, Virginia had recorded 515 cases in total.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Zero cases possible?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Despite the stumbles throughout the past five months, public health experts interviewed by States Newsroom said monkeypox cases could continue to decrease in the coming months, though they cautioned there’s plenty of work to be done before that might happen.</p>
<p>“I do think it&#8217;s very possible we get to zero, and I think, you know, it&#8217;s potentially even possible we get to zero before the end of this year,” said Aaron Guest, chair of the LGBTQ Health Caucus at the American Public Health Association.</p>
<p>A decline in social activities, an increase in vaccinations and a broader understanding of how monkeypox spreads all helped to decrease new case numbers, though Guest said it will be a while before public health experts can look back “​​at how successful some of the interventions and education campaigns were.”</p>
<p>Guest said the best case scenario for him, if cases reach zero for a sustained amount of time, would be for public health officials to continue talking about monkeypox. He’d also like to see doctors include education about the virus in regular checkups and STI testing, for vaccinations to continue and for the one approved vaccine to be stockpiled for a possible future outbreak.</p>
<p>He cautioned, however, that certain pockets of the country or larger cities could continue to see periodic upticks in positive test results, even if the virus remains dormant for large swaths of time.</p>
<p>Researchers and public health officials, he said, will also need to ensure lower case numbers don’t coincide with apathy.</p>
<p>“What I think I unfortunately know is that oftentimes we have a very short attention span,” Guest said. “And once it seems like we&#8217;ve dealt with something, we kind of move on to the next thing or now that the emergency is over &#8230; we are not going to dedicate funding and resources to addressing these challenges.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data on race, ethnicity</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Jessica Justman, associate professor of medicine at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, said the CDC data on race and ethnicity is concerning.</p>
<p>“That steady increase in the Black and African American population really makes me say, you know, we can&#8217;t just completely sit back here,” Justman said. “We&#8217;ve just seen the same kind of story over and over with other epidemics, with HIV, with COVID, that these infections tend to concentrate in certain parts of the population that probably have less access to vaccines, have less access to health information.”</p>
<p>After the first month of this outbreak, white people made up about half of all cases in the U.S., with Hispanic or Latino individuals making up about 31% and Black or African American people making up less than 12%, according to the CDC partial <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/demographics.html" target="_blank">data</a> for the week of June 19.</p>
<p>Beginning in early July, the percentage of Hispanic or Latino individuals diagnosed with monkeypox stayed around 30% of total cases until mid-September, when it decreased into the low 20% category. The share of white people with the virus decreased from 37% to 29% of cases. In that same time frame, the percent of Black or African Americans rose from 22% to 42% of all U.S. cases, according to CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/demographics.html" target="_blank">data</a>.</p>
<p>CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a briefing on Sept. 15 that public health officials had begun to see the &#8220;racial and ethnic makeup of this outbreak evolve.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Larger shares of cases</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The Kaiser Family Foundation&#8217;s <a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/national-data-show-continuing-disparities-in-mpx-monkeypox-cases-and-vaccinations-among-black-and-hispanic-people/" target="_blank">breakdown</a> of CDC data on race and ethnicity, which only includes 68% of cases reported as of Sept. 23, notes that &#8220;Black and Hispanic people account for larger shares of cases compared with their shares of the population.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, while people of color make up about 40% of the U.S. population, they made up about 70% of the monkeypox cases at that time.</p>
<p>Data on vaccinations is also skewed when broken down by race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Walensky said during the briefing in mid-September that white individuals made up 47% of people who had received their first dose of the Jynneos vaccine, while Hispanic individuals represented about 21% and Black people about 12%.</p>
<p>The CDC’s data, however, isn’t complete, coming from 39 jurisdictions and accounting for roughly 91% of first-dose shots.</p>
<p>Public health officials, Justman said, should continue vaccinating the at-risk populations, regardless of how low case numbers go.</p>
<p>“Really, to me, the marker of when to say we&#8217;ve done enough is when you have covered a very high percentage of the at-risk population,” she said.</p>
<p>Justman said the decline in monkeypox cases within the United States is due to the vaccination campaign as well as behavior changes, though she cautioned there isn’t a lot of data on exactly how many people have adopted changes in their physical contact.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Largest outbreak in U.S. history</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Monkeypox, first discovered in 1958 in research monkeys, spreads through direct physical contact, by touching fabrics such as bedding or towels used by someone with the virus, or by contact with respiratory secretions, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>Since the first human case was diagnosed in 1970, the vast majority of cases have been in central and western Africa, while cases outside that region have been linked to travel to the area or imported animals.</p>

<p>This year’s outbreak, the largest in U.S. history, began in mid-May when doctors diagnosed the disease in a Massachusetts man. Europe and other regions of the world where monkeypox isn’t traditionally diagnosed also experienced a significant outbreak this year.</p>
<p>In total, there have been more than 72,000 monkeypox diagnoses in countries without a history of the virus. There have been 28 deaths, including two in the U.S., according to the CDC.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Understanding the vaccine</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Elizabeth Finley, director of communications at the National Coalition of STD Directors, said that while she expects new diagnoses of monkeypox to continue to decline, she doesn’t expect the virus to disappear.</p>
<p>“I think we will continue to see a low number of monkeypox cases,” she said. “I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going away.”</p>
<p>One key aspect of the ongoing response, she said, needs to be developing a better understanding of how well the Jynneos vaccine performs after one dose as well as after the complete two-dose series, and how long protection will last.</p>
<p>“This is a vaccine that was designed to help the nation or other nations address a smallpox outbreak. It wasn&#8217;t necessarily designed to be a long-term plan for something like monkeypox,” Finley said.</p>
<p>While anyone can get monkeypox, this outbreak has predominantly affected gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, leading public health officials to urge community members to limit physical contact.</p>
<p>But, Finley said, experts haven’t been clear about how long and to what degree people should withhold or severely limit physical contact.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t know that that&#8217;s sustainable. And frankly, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s fair to ask people to sustain that kind of a change,” Finley said.</p>
<p>As cases of monkeypox continue to decline, Finley said she hopes public health officials will target their outreach to people who have little to no access to health care and who may not be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, said he believes it&#8217;s going to take some time before the United States reaches zero cases, though he thinks it&#8217;s possible with sustained education, vaccination and treatment.</p>
<p>He, however, cautioned that won’t mean doctors will never diagnose monkeypox again.</p>
<p>“The U.S. can get to a certain level of resiliency, but there&#8217;s always going to be some chance of importation from all of these other European countries, for example, where the disease is also spreading,”  Adalja said. “So there may still be sporadic outbreaks until enough of the population is immune here or vaccinated. And if the vaccine is considered robust enough to keep it at bay.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — Members of Congress are fanning out to every district in the country, leaving the wonky floor debates on Capitol Hill behind for the campaign trail in advance of the crucial Nov. 8 midterm elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are fighting to hold their razor-thin majorities in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, citing two years of victories on infrastructure, climate and prescription drug coverage. Republicans — whose early expectations they’d sweep the House were tempered after a Supreme Court abortion ruling — are trying to convince voters they need to balance the scales by putting them in charge of one or both chambers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GOP candidates are attempting to tie Democrats to inflation, crime, fears about immigration and </span><a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/bidens-job-approval-rating-the-midterm-elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an unpopular president</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But they’re </span><a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/dc-bureau/republicans-in-congress-shy-away-from-campaigning-on-national-abortion-platform/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shying away</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from talking about a national abortion ban in the wake of the court’s decision to overturn two previous cases declaring abortion a constitutional right — while Democrats are seeking something of a nationwide referendum on abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to the tension in an unusual midterm election, Republican election deniers are </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2022/election-deniers-running-for-office-elections-2022/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in many states. Election officials have </span><a href="https://coloradonewsline.com/2022/08/03/election-officials-at-u-s-senate-hearing-describe-threats-spread-of-misinformation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">described</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">threats and a spread of misinformation. Polls in the tightest races aren&#8217;t giving a clear indication of who voters want in office, often switching from one week to the next or putting both candidates within the margin of error.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The polling uncertainty has left party leaders to funnel as much cash and attention to key races as possible, with Senate battles in Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin drawing the most media and cash. Spending overall is expected to top a record $9.3 billion by the time the election is over</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/cost-of-election?cycle=2020&amp;display=T&amp;infl=N" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Open Secrets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican not up for reelection this year, pegs the chances the GOP regains that chamber as dead even. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re in a bunch of close races. I think we have a 50-50 shot of getting the Senate back,” McConnell said the last week of September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McConnell sidestepped a question during the same press conference about whether he was being “overly dismissive” about the role abortion might play with suburban women, who tend to swing between voting for Democrats and Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that issue is playing out in different ways in different states,” McConnell said, countering that the three biggest national issues Republicans will pound away at during the campaign will be “inflation, crime and open borders.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s been the only ballot question about abortion since the Supreme Court’s ruling in June, though California, Kentucky, Michigan and Vermont residents </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/abortion-access-ballot-november-these-states" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will vote on abortion ballot questions</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">on election day. </span></p>

That figure was down from 37% in a July poll. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion came in second, with 22% of people surveyed citing it as a top issue, up from 18% in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The Supreme Court&#8217;s decision on Dobbs this summer has had a major impact on electoral politics heading toward the midterm elections,&#8221; Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, said in a statement accompanying the poll. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion has likely been the most significant factor in improving Democrats’ chances in the past few months, Erin Covey, an analyst with the forecasting group Inside Elections, said in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the inflation issue is also powerful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consumer price index, which is the average market basket of consumer goods and services bought by a household, has </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a continued increase in the cost of shelter, food, medical costs and education. The CPI determined that food has increased 11.4% over the last year — the largest 12-month increase since May 1979.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite economic concerns, the poll still found that Democrats have a 4-point advantage over Republicans in this upcoming election, primarily due to the Supreme Court’s decision.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tight races</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have seized upon abortion as an issue to motivate their base and get new voters to the polls, but it’s unclear if those new voter registrants, particularly women, are due to the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling and if that will help Democrats win tight races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In every election since 1980, women have always outnumbered men in regard to voter registrations, </span><a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data compiled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic data firm </span><a href="https://insights.targetsmart.com/the-targetsmart-voter-registration-dashboard.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TargetSmart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which tracks voter registrations, found that there was a spike in registrations of women voters following the early leak of the Dobbs decision, but voter registrations in 2018 and 2020 were still higher than voter registrations when Roe v. Wade was overturned on June 24.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite their struggles dealing with the abortion issue, Republican leaders in the U.S. House still expect they’ll regain control. But key Democrats have become more outspoken in recent weeks, saying voters will keep them in the majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer and Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal have all said they expect to hold onto the House. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pelosi, a California Democrat, said this week on CBS&#8217; “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” that overturning Roe v. Wade had a significant impact on how Democrats are approaching the midterm campaigns, leading to “a whole different attitude on the part of some about whether we could win.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel just watching each of the races — forgive me for saying this, in a very cold-blooded way, as to which races we can win, to ensure that we not only hold the House, but we increase our number,” Pelosi said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jayapal, of Washington state, said on a call with reporters she plans to campaign for at-risk progressive Democrats in the coming weeks, noting that many of the CPC’s members are also in the so-called Frontline program, which directs resources to Democrats in swing districts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think progressives can win in tough districts and have shown it over and over again,” Jayapal said.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats’ pitch</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic candidates are running on what they call a raft of accomplishments over the last two years of unified government, touting infrastructure, climate change and prescription drug prices, among others, Tommy Garcia, a spokesman for House Democrats’ campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said. They are also focused on what they call Republican candidates’ extremism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A Democratic majority will build on this historic progress, continue fighting to lower the cost of living for working families, and restore </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s abortion protections that Republican judges ripped away,” Garcia said in a written statement. “Voters will reject the GOP’s plan to ban abortion nationwide, throw out votes if they don&#8217;t like the results of an election, gut Social Security and Medicare, and stir up fear for their own benefit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden’s approval rating has ticked up since Democrats notched a few victories this summer, passing bills on gun violence and climate, health and taxes, as well as granting student loan debt relief. Moderate drops in gas prices from record highs earlier this year have also helped, Covey said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, polling in individual races has not shown a massive shift toward Democratic candidates, she said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Biden’s approval has gone up a bit, the generic ballot a little bit better. And obviously, we have seen Democratic over-performance in special elections,” she said. “In terms of the polling on an individual level, there hasn&#8217;t been a significant shift towards that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts still rate a Republican takeover of the House as the most likely outcome, though the prospect of a landslide election is less probable, she added.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Who’s at risk?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has 39 members in its Frontline program, naming them as at risk of losing reelection. The House’s current party breakdown is 220 Democrats, 212 Republicans and three vacancies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP’s campaign arm, placed 75 Democrats on its “</span><a href="https://www.nrcc.org/2022/06/09/nrcc-expands-target-list-to-75-following-conclusion-of-redistricting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">target list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” after all states completed their redistricting processes in June. The cohort includes all of the Frontline Democrats, except Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Pat Ryan of New York. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter, however, has 30 House races </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/house-race-ratings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the “toss-up” category,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with 20 of those held by Democrats, nine controlled by GOP members and one new district in Colorado.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cook places 194 House seats as leaning toward Democratic control while 211 seats are favored for Republicans. That means the GOP needs to win fewer of the 30 toss-up races to reach the 218 seats needed to control the chamber. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While every House seat is up for reelection for another two-year term, just one-third of the Senate will face voters on Nov. 8, since members are elected to six-year terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate races, Cook </span><a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin races as toss-ups. The Arizona, Colorado and New Hampshire races lean toward a Democrat winning. And the Florida, North Carolina and Ohio races lean toward a Republican victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine Senate seats held by Democrats are expected to stay blue, while 15 seats up this cycle that are held by Republicans are in the solidly GOP category. The Utah Senate race is classified as likely going to a Republican, according to Cook’s ratings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pennsylvania, where Democrat John Fetterman faces Republican Mehmet Oz for an open seat, was rated as </span>lean Democrat, but was moved to a toss-up this week, with Cook’s Senate and Governors Editor Jessica Taylor writing that it has become a “margin-of-error” race.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Republicans and Democrats alike admit the race has tightened and that Pennsylvania could be the tipping point state for the Senate majority,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Biden ratings</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philip Chen, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Denver, said that in the Senate, Democrats have a better chance of picking up more seats because “Republicans are defending a lot of seats, and Democrats are fairly solid in the ones that they&#8217;re holding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that the popularity of the president does come into play. A </span><a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-BIDEN/POLL/nmopagnqapa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this month found that Biden’s approval was only 40%, which was actually up from his May low of 36% approval in the same survey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We really will have to see how much the national mood dissatisfaction with President Biden and (how) things like that really do influence things, (and) how much of it is just the Senate is a tougher battle for Republicans this time around,” Chen said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Republican Senatorial Committee has </span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cmte=NRSC&amp;cycle=2022" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> millions of dollars against Democrats in key states. This election cycle the NRSC has spent more than $9 million against Sen. Mark Kelly in Arizona, and more than $4 million against Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has </span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/indexp.php?cycle=2022&amp;cmte=DSCC" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $10.5 million against Kelly’s Republican opponent, Blake Masters, and $3 million against Warnock’s Republican opponent, Herschel Walker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden, speaking at a Democratic National Committee reception in New Jersey on Thursday, cited the tendency for the president’s party to lose some power in the first midterms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based on statistics, the Democrats are running uphill because of the fact that, with only a couple exceptions, the first term of an incumbent president on the off-year election has been not a good deal most times,” Biden said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then predicted that Democrats would hold the Senate, possibly picking up “a couple seats,” though he didn’t seem as optimistic about the party’s chances of keeping the House — blaming trends at the state level. Biden pointed out there’s been “​​a lot of gerrymandering in the House across the country, because a lot of governors aren&#8217;t Democratic governors.”</span></p>

(Scott Elmquist/Style Weekly)</p><p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Thursday announced executive actions that would <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/10/06/granting-pardon-for-the-offense-of-simple-possession-of-marijuana/" target="_blank">pardon thousands of people </a>with prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession.</p>
<p>Biden then called on governors to follow suit with state offenses for simple marijuana possession, saying that “just as no one should be in a federal prison solely due to the possession of marijuana, no one should be in a local jail or state prison for that reason, either.”</p>
<p>The president also directed U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra and Attorney General Merrick Garland to review how marijuana is classified under federal law as a Schedule I drug, the Drug Enforcement Agency’s most dangerous classification that includes substances like heroin and LSD.</p>
<p>Biden’s executive order to pardon simple possession includes the District of Columbia as well as people convicted in the federal court system.</p>
<p>“Sending people to prison for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives and incarcerated people for conduct that many states no longer prohibit,” Biden said in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/10/06/statement-from-president-biden-on-marijuana-reform/" target="_blank">statement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Failed approach to marijuana’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The move is intended to address <a href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2021/12/22/federal-law-still-treats-marijuana-as-an-illegal-drug-creating-headaches-for-states/" target="_blank">the country’s “failed approach to marijuana,”</a> a senior administration official said Thursday afternoon minutes before the announcement.</p>
<p>Recreational use of marijuana is legal in 19 states, including Virginia, but there is still a mix of laws related to the drug. In 38 states, marijuana is allowed for medical purposes. Several others consider marijuana illegal in all forms.</p>
<p>Civil rights organizations and researchers have shown that charges for marijuana possession disproportionately affect Black and brown communities. For example, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/sentencing-reform/war-marijuana-black-and-white" target="_blank">ACLU found</a> that Black people were 3.7 times more likely to be charged with marijuana possession compared to white people.</p>
<p>Police made 663,000 arrests for <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/22/four-in-ten-u-s-drug-arrests-in-2018-were-for-marijuana-offenses-mostly-possession/" target="_blank">marijuana-related offenses</a> in 2018, according to FBI data, which amounted to 40% of all drug arrests for that year.</p>
<p>A senior administration official said Thursday that “while white, Black and brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black and brown people are disproportionately in jail for it.”</p>
<p>Senior administration officials said that even if a person has not been charged with or convicted of marijuana possession, as of Thursday’s date, “the pardon does cover that conduct.”</p>
<p>The Department of Justice will create an administrative process for those who are pardoned to obtain a certificate of their pardon “so that they will have documentation that they can show to law enforcement, employers and others as needed,” a senior administration official said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">States moved first</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>States began decriminalizing or legalizing recreational use of marijuana in 2012, when Colorado and Washington voters passed statewide ballot measures. Over the next decade, 17 more states followed suit. Those states have operated for years in conflict with federal laws that have kept the substance strictly illegal.</p>
<p>Virginia <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/04/07/marijuana-will-be-legal-in-virginia-on-july-1-heres-what-is-and-isnt-permitted-under-the-new-law/" target="_blank">became the first state in the South to legalize marijuana in 2021</a>, although state lawmakers have <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/28/house-gop-kills-bill-to-begin-retail-recreational-marijuana-sales-this-year/" target="_blank">struggled to agree on the parameters of a retail market</a>.</p>

<p>The U.S. House <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2022/04/01/u-s-house-votes-to-decriminalize-marijuana-in-federal-law/" target="_blank">passed legislation</a> earlier this year to legalize marijuana nationally, but the bill failed to gain traction in the Senate.</p>
<p>The House <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022107" target="_blank">voted 220-204</a> to approve <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617" target="_blank">the measure</a>, which would fix the split between federal law and law in states where recreational marijuana is legal. Three Republicans joined all but two Democrats in approving the measure.</p>
<p>Democratic lawmakers reacted positively to Biden’s announcement, and several called for full legalization.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said federal drug policies relating to marijuana have harmed communities of color and torn families apart.</p>
<p>“These transformative actions are the latest manifestation of Democrats’ unyielding commitment to justice, especially for those unfairly harmed by cannabis criminalization,” she said in a statement.</p>
<p>“A great first step for equitable treatment under the law — but we can and we will do more when we (expand) our Democratic majorities in November,” Virginia’s Rep. Gerry Connolly <a href="https://twitter.com/ElectConnolly/status/1578110544241983494" target="_blank">said</a>. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine called the move &#8220;wise and compassionate.&#8221;</p>
<p>U.S. Sen Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, applauded the move in a statement and called for passage of<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4591" target="_blank"> a bill</a> he sponsored, along with New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker and Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, that would remove the substance from the list of controlled substances and expunge the records of anyone convicted of a marijuana-related crime.</p>
<p>“Legal protections for victims of the War on Drugs should be codified in law, cannabis should be descheduled and a federal regulatory system should be put in place to protect public health and safety,” he said.</p>
<p>Schumer called the action “historic” and said he hoped it would catalyze further congressional action.</p>
<p>“For far too long, the federal prohibition on cannabis and the War on Drugs has been a war on people, and particularly people of color,” the New York Democrat said in a statement. “President Biden’s action to pardon people convicted of simple marijuana possession under federal law is a huge step forward to correct decades of over-criminalization.”</p>
<p>Chair of the House Education and Labor Committee Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat, said in a statement that incarcerating people for possession of marijuana does not keep communities safer and is a waste of federal resources.</p>
<p>“We should instead be using those funds on evidence-based prevention and early intervention initiatives that actually reduce crime and save money,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">GOP ties pardons to crime</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Many more Democrats than Republicans commented on the move, which is in line with most Americans’ views on marijuana. A MorningConsult/Politico <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/10/05/most-voters-back-federal-marijuana-legalization/" target="_blank">poll this month</a> found that 60% of respondents favored legalization.</p>
<p>Republicans who did comment largely framed the initiative as soft on crime. Republicans are making rising crime rates a campaign issue in next month’s elections.</p>
<p>“In the midst of a crime wave and on the brink of a recession, Joe Biden is giving blanket pardons to drug offenders — many of whom pled down from more serious charges,” Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican of Arkansas, said on Twitter. An earlier version of the tweet, which was deleted after nine minutes, complained of pardons to “pot heads.”</p>
<p>Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is retiring this year, said in a statement that the Justice Department should not issue “blanket pardons” and each offender should be looked at individually. Hutchinson was the director of the Drug Enforcement Administration under President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>“As governor I have issued hundreds of pardons to those who have been convicted of drug offenses,” he said. “But in this time of rising crime there should be a clear record of law-abiding conduct before pardons are issued.”</p>
<p>Hutchinson is staunchly anti-legalization and has publicly opposed the proposed constitutional amendment on the Nov. 8 ballot that would create a legal marijuana regime in Arkansas.</p>
<p>Candidates campaigning for Congress quickly weighed in on the announcement as well, with Pennsylvania Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman saying in a statement that it’s “a massive step towards justice.”</p>
<p>“Too many lives — and lives of Black and brown Americans in particular — have been derailed by this criminalization of this plant,” Fetterman said.</p>
<p>Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, who is running for the open Senate seat, tweeted “legalize it” from his congressional Twitter account.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Schedule 1 drug</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Unless Congress changes federal marijuana laws or the president takes further action, marijuana is likely to stay classified as a Schedule 1 drug for the near future.</p>
<p>Senior administration officials said Thursday it will take a while for the HHS secretary and the attorney general to assess if marijuana should stay in the highest classification or drop to a lower category within the DEA’s system.</p>
<p>“The process will take some time, because it must be based on a careful consideration of all of the available evidence, including scientific … and medical information that&#8217;s available,” the senior administration official said, adding that while Biden hasn’t set a timeline he wants the review to be “expeditious.”</p>
<p>The DEA has five schedule classifications for legal and illegal drugs, with Schedule 1 including substances with a high potential for abuse and no medical use. Heroin, LSD and peyote are classified as Schedule 1 drugs along with marijuana.</p>
<p>The next category, Schedule 2, is supposed to host drugs with a high potential for abuse and that can lead to “severe psychological or physical dependence,” according to the DEA. Cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamine and oxycodone are all currently classified as Schedule 2.</p>
<p>Schedule 3 includes substances with a low to moderate likelihood of physical and psychological dependence, such as anabolic steroids and testosterone. Schedule 4 hosts drugs like Xanax, Valium and Ambien that have a low potential for abuse, according to the DEA. And Schedule 5 includes substances with a lower possibility of abuse than Schedule 4.</p>

(Credit: Toni Smith, USGS. Public domain</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. House members, mostly along party lines, cleared a spending package Friday that would bolster funding for natural disaster response, though with Hurricane Ian still battering the Southeast, lawmakers will likely need to approve another aid bill later this year.</p>
<p>The measure would provide $2.5 billion in assistance for the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire that destroyed parts of New Mexico this spring, $2 billion in Community Development Block Grant disaster relief funding for states affected by natural disasters during 2021 and 2022 and $1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. The measure also includes $12 billion to help Ukraine continue to defend itself following Russia’s invasion in February.</p>
<p>The package would keep the federal government up and running through Dec. 16, giving congressional leaders and the White House more time to work out how much to spend on discretionary programs and to draft bipartisan versions of the dozen annual government funding bills.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/H6833AM08.PDF" target="_blank">bill</a>, <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2022476" target="_blank">approved 230-201</a>, now heads to President Joe Biden for his signature. He needs to sign the measure before midnight, when the current government spending law expires ahead of the start of the new fiscal year Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s House delegation split on party lines on the measure, with all seven Democrats supporting it and all four Republicans voting no.</p>
<p>If the stopgap spending bill hadn’t cleared Congress, the federal government would have begun a partial government shutdown early Saturday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-approves-stopgap-spending-bill-disaster-relief-heating-aid" target="_blank">approved the bill </a>following a 72-25 vote Thursday, with all opposition coming from Republicans.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans blast December deadline</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>GOP lawmakers in the U.S. House spoke out against the package Friday, arguing that setting up a government funding deadline during the lame-duck session following the midterm elections wasn’t the right decision.</p>
<p>“This legislation represents Congress at its worst,” said GOP Rep. Bob Good of Virginia.</p>
<p>The stopgap spending bill, Good said, shouldn’t expire until after the new Congress convenes in January, preventing the current Democratic-controlled House and Senate from passing any more spending bills.</p>
<p>Even if Republicans were to gain control of the U.S. House and Senate following November’s midterm elections, the spending bills would still need bipartisan support to clear the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster and the backing of the Biden administration to avoid a veto.</p>
<p>House Appropriations ranking member Kay Granger, a Texas Republican, urged lawmakers to vote against the bill, saying it didn’t do enough to address border security, energy or inflation.</p>
<p>Granger also chastised Democrats for releasing the short-term bill Monday with just days to go before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s unfortunate that this bill would be rushed through the House today with just hours to spare to avoid a government shutdown,” Granger said. “The American people continue to wonder why Congress can&#8217;t get its job done until the very last minute.”</p>
<p>Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz called on House members to vote for the package, saying the disaster relief funding is crucial for states like hers.</p>
<p>“Look no further than Southwest Florida, in my home state, where Hurricane Ian inflicted tragic human loss and massive property damage,” she said.</p>
<p>“We cannot leave communities behind that are still picking up the pieces from disastrous floods, wildfires and hurricanes, and even basic water system failures,” she added. “This federal funding bill comes to the rescue by helping to meet long-term housing, infrastructure and recovery needs.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Short-term bills</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Congress hasn’t completed its appropriations process on time since 1996 and regularly starts off the new fiscal year under a stopgap spending bill that typically lasts through mid-December.</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats have consistently leaned on short-term government funding bills, or continuing resolutions, to give themselves more time to negotiate the full-year spending bills.</p>
<p>Congress relied on a string of the short-term bills to keep the government running for the full year in fiscal years 2007, 2011 and 2013, according to the Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p>The stopgap spending package approved Friday mostly continues current spending levels and policies from the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471" target="_blank"> omnibus spending package</a> Congress approved with bipartisan majorities in March.</p>

(Ariana Figueroa / States Newsroom D.C. Bureau)</p><p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate approved broadly bipartisan legislation Thursday that would provide billions for natural disaster relief, military and economic aid to Ukraine as well as funding to help low-income families offset the rising costs of heating and cooling their homes.</p>
<p>The legislation includes $2.5 billion in assistance for the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire that burned large swaths of New Mexico this spring, $2 billion in Community Development Block Grant disaster relief funding for states impacted by natural disasters during 2021 and 2022, and $1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden said Thursday that given ongoing natural disasters, such as the hurricane in Florida now moving up the coast, more funding may be needed later this year to help communities recover from hurricanes and severe storms.</p>
<p>The package approved Thursday was formed around a short-term spending bill that must pass before Friday at midnight to keep the federal government open through Dec. 16 while congressional leaders and the Biden administration attempt to reach a full-year spending deal.</p>
<p>Using the stopgap spending bill to give themselves a couple more months to work through the annual appropriations process is a regular practice for Congress, which hasn’t completed its work on time since the last century.</p>
<p>The 72-25 Senate vote Thursday sends the measure to the U.S. House, where members are expected to clear the package for Biden on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Manchin plan yanked</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The legislation <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/stopgap-spending-bill-advances-us-senate-after-manchin-pulls-his-energy-plan" target="_blank">cleared an important procedural vote</a> earlier this week after West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III asked Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to remove an energy permitting reform bill the two had agreed to tack on to the must-pass package.</p>
<p>Republicans had broadly rejected the energy permitting bill while Democrats in both chambers of Congress criticized both the substance of the bill and the fact Manchin and Schumer struck a deal to advance the measure through Congress without input from other Democrats.</p>
<p>Schumer and Manchin both said <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/manchin-seeks-bipartisan-sweet-spot-new-try-his-energy-permitting-bill" target="_blank">they hope to find a path forward for the energy permitting legislation </a>before this session of Congress ends later this year. But that bill will likely need a rewrite to garner necessary support from members.</p>
<p>The spending bill approved Thursday includes more than $12 billion in economic and military assistance for Ukraine as the country continues its war against Russia’s invasion into the winter months. The new round would bring U.S. investment in the conflict to $66 billion.</p>
<p>Schumer said in a floor speech Thursday that American weaponry has helped Ukraine’s military turn the tide against Russia.</p>
<p>“We cannot stop now,” he said.</p>
<p>The package doesn’t include any new funding for ongoing public health emergencies, rejecting the White House’s request for $22.4 billion in COVID-19 funding and $4.5 billion for the monkeypox outbreak.</p>
<p>Senate Appropriations Chairman Pat Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said just before the vote that he will push to get COVID-19 funding in the full-year government funding package that could pass in December.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More time for negotiation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The short-term government funding part of the measure is intended to give Congress and the Biden administration more time to negotiate total discretionary spending levels for fiscal year 2023, slated to begin Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Those negotiations never really got off the ground after Biden sent Congress his budget request in March asking U.S. lawmakers to provide $795 billion for defense spending and $915 billion for nondefense programs, which includes funding for the Homeland Security, Justice and Veterans Affairs departments.</p>
<p>Republicans scoffed at the defense request, saying it didn’t increase spending on those programs nearly enough compared to current funding of $782 billion.</p>
<p>Many GOP lawmakers also argued the proposed jump in nondefense funding, from $730 billion, was a bit too high.</p>

<p>Senate Appropriations ranking member Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican set to retire at the end of this Congress, said he thinks there’s a good chance the two parties will reach an agreement this year.</p>
<p>“A lot of that will come from what we can do with the defense number — if we can work that out, I bet we can work the other out,” Shelby said.</p>
<p>Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, chair of the subcommittee that funds the Agriculture Department, the Food and Drug Administration and rural development programs, said she expects Leahy and Shelby’s retirements will provide momentum to complete full-year government spending bills during the lame-duck session.</p>
<p>“I think minds will focus and agreement will be reached following the midterms,” Baldwin said. “I think that&#8217;s when there&#8217;ll be greater focus and a month to get it done basically.”</p>
<p>“You have a retiring chairman and ranking member who very much want to make sure we have an omnibus rather than a continuing resolution,” she added. “And I think they&#8217;ll be committed to that.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Waiting on November</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Indiana GOP Sen. Mike Braun, ranking member of the Legislative Branch funding panel that provides money for Congress and the Supreme Court, said he expects the dozen spending bills will come together faster than the last go around, which ended more than five months late this March.</p>
<p>“I do think it will probably get done more quickly than that, but nobody&#8217;s given any indication,” he said.</p>
<p>Braun doesn’t expect congressional leaders and the Biden administration will agree to total spending levels, the first step to writing full-year bills, until after November’s midterm elections.</p>
<p>Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy, the top Republican on the subcommittee that funds the Energy Department and Army Corps of Engineers, also said he expects the package to come together after the election.</p>
<p>“Look, what I see happening is once again the so-called leadership gets together and puts together an omnibus and gives it to us and says, ‘Take it or leave it,’” he said.</p>
<p>That process, Kennedy said, is “an insult to the American people and a horrible way to put together” the final versions of the annual government funding bills.</p>

(Ned Oliver / Virginia Mercury)</p><p>WASHINGTON — U.S. senators from both parties said Wednesday they still hope to negotiate an energy permitting reform bill this year, reviving efforts to streamline the process after West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin III had to pull back his plan amid broad opposition.</p>
<p>The Manchin proposal was attached to a must-pass government funding bill as part of a deal he struck with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer this summer to advance the Democrats&#8217; Inflation Reduction Act. But permitting reform was rejected by GOP senators irked by that deal, as well as members of his own party.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/third-us-house-democrats-oppose-manchin-permitting-deal-stopgap-spending-bill" target="_blank">large group of House</a> Democrats — and a smaller Senate cohort — intensely opposed what they characterized as a fossil-fuel-friendly measure from the start, saying Manchin would weaken environmental protections and make it more difficult for communities to object to new construction. The House opposition was led by progressive Arizona Democratic Rep. Raúl Grijalva, but included leaders of budget and spending panels as well.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans meanwhile refused to endorse the Manchin-Schumer deal that allowed the passage of Democrats’ sweeping climate, health and taxes bill this summer, even if they agreed in principle that permitting requirements should be updated.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread condemnation of his measure, Manchin said Wednesday he expects to keep working to get an agreement before the new year, a goal many of his fellow senators said they share.</p>
<p>Manchin said he plans to talk with fellow West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, when the two are back in their home state next month, noting he’s optimistic the duo can work out a final bill.</p>
<p>“We just have to find the sweet spot, find the middle that kind of appeases the majority,” Manchin said.</p>
<p>The centrist Democrat nodded when asked by a reporter if Schumer had assured him he’d try again with another floor vote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mountain Valley Pipeline</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Schumer pledged Tuesday evening, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/after-manchin-pulls-his-energy-permitting-plan-senate-advances-spending-bill" target="_blank">after stripping Manchin’s permitting bill from the must-pass government spending package</a>, to “have conversations about the best way to ensure responsible permitting reform is passed before the end of the year.”</p>
<p>White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre released a statement Tuesday night saying President Joe Biden &#8220;supports Senator Manchin’s plan because it is necessary for our energy security, and to make more clean energy available to the American people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to work with him to find a vehicle to bring this bill to the floor and get it passed and to the President’s desk,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Whether Manchin’s bill would still include the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline running from West Virginia to Virginia was unclear on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, who was <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/kaine-says-mountain-valley-pipeline-provision-in-manchin-bill-could-open-the-door-to-serious-abuse-and-even-corruption/" target="_blank">furious Manchin’s permitting reform bill included approval of the Mountain Valley Pipeline</a>, said he believes there’s a good outlook for a bipartisan permitting reform bill, estimating it could get at least 70 votes in the Senate.</p>
<p>Work on permitting reform so far by the Environment and Public Works Committee, chaired by Delaware Democratic Sen. Tom Carper, and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Manchin, has already found a good starting point to a bipartisan bill, Kaine said.</p>
<p>“They worked on it very, very carefully,” Kaine said, noting he’s not on either of those panels. “I don&#8217;t want to tell them what their timing should be. But they&#8217;re down the road and there&#8217;s a bipartisan group that want to do it, including me.”</p>
<p>On the Mountain Valley Pipeline, Kaine said he didn’t want to get into “a hypothetical world and what might be acceptable.”</p>
<p>But Kaine, who has said he was not consulted about the inclusion of the pipeline in the Manchin plan, did say the way Manchin handled the pipeline in his bill wasn’t the right way to go.</p>
<p>“It was taking something out of permitting and saying ‘You don&#8217;t have to comply,’” Kaine said. “But permitting reforms could make the process better and then Mountain Valley and others could have a better process to go through.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans want another try</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines said during a brief interview Wednesday he hopes there’s a way for Democrats and Republicans to draft a bill after the elections and before the next Congress begins that both parties could support.</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s an issue that we need to address. And it&#8217;s a significant obstacle to continue to allow us to develop our natural resources,” Daines said. “It&#8217;s not just about energy. It&#8217;s also about forestry. It&#8217;s about mining and it takes way too long to get projects approved.”</p>
<p>Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy said a permitting reform bill is essential for lawmakers who want to see more fossil fuel extraction as well as those who want “cleaner forms of energy.”</p>
<p>“I hope we can sit down and put together a permitting bill,” Kennedy said. “I mean, no fair-minded person can believe that it should take five, seven, eight years to get a project permitted in America. I don&#8217;t care what the project is.”</p>
<p>Kennedy said the rejection of Manchin’s permitting reform bill was about more than just signaling the GOP wanted a more bipartisan bill.</p>
<p>He said it was about members of both parties sending a message to Manchin following months of negotiations on the Democrats’ spending package from this summer that included money for renewable energy, among dozens of other provisions.</p>
<p>“What I saw happen yesterday — how can I explain this — two wrongs rarely make it right, but they do make it even,” Kennedy said. “And what happened yesterday was people who are unhappy with Senator Manchin, on both sides of the aisle, made it even.”</p>

<p>“We now have a fresh start and I hope we can sit down and put together a permitting bill,” Kennedy said.</p>
<p>Kennedy said he’d like a final, bipartisan energy permitting reform bill to set firm end dates for studies into energy projects.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t want to foreclose anybody&#8217;s right to study or object, but have some hard and fast rule saying this is the end of the process,” he said. “Two or three years is plenty of time for people to be able to study a project before a decision has to be made.”</p>
<p>Louisiana GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy said more lawmakers than just Schumer and Manchin need to be involved in drafting the measure if it’s going to have any chance of becoming law and improving the energy permitting process.</p>
<p>“I’d like to have some sort of shot clock with teeth, so that agencies can’t just sit on an application and do a pocket veto of things that otherwise meet every criteria. This permitting reform did not really have that,” Cassidy said.</p>
<p>He said he doesn’t mind if a bipartisan bill gets attached to an unrelated must-pass bill, saying he’s “never a purist on procedure.”</p>
<p>Montana Democratic Sen. Jon Tester said he’d like to have more input in negotiating the permitting reform bill.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tricky path</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>If senators, and possibly their U.S. House colleagues, work out a bipartisan bill, Schumer will have to decide how to move the legislation through the floor.</p>
<p>Given the amount of time it takes to move stand-alone legislation on the U.S. Senate floor and the short amount of time the chamber will be in Washington, D.C., during the lame duck session following the midterm elections, several lawmakers have floated the idea of attaching permitting reform to a must-pass bill.</p>
<p>One possible option is the National Defense Authorization Act, the Pentagon’s annual policy bill, which Schumer has said the chamber will take up during October.</p>
<p>That option might not be especially appealing to members of the panel who have traditionally walled off the bill from policy proposals that aren’t directly related to defense or national security.</p>
<p>Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday she doesn’t want to see a permitting reform bill tacked onto the defense policy bill.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t know that that&#8217;s a good idea. I&#8217;ll be honest,” Ernst said. “I&#8217;d rather see germane amendments being placed, and we have a lot of amendments that we would like to see come up that are germane. So to have one that&#8217;s not germane be placed upon the NDAA would probably create some heartache.”</p>

Joe Manchin that would have required completion of the controversial Mountain Valley Pipeline was halted Tuesday.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer removed the measure from a catchall spending package late in the afternoon after Manchin released a statement calling on him to do so.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate then voted 72-23 to advance the spending bill, which would provide billions to aid Ukraine’s war effort, help communities throughout the country recover from natural disasters and keep the federal government funded through mid-December.</p>
<p>The Manchin plan had drawn widespread rebuke from most Republicans, a few Senate Democrats including Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine and a large group of progressive U.S. House members, all of which could have put passage of the government funding package at risk before current law expires on Friday at midnight.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pxW9ylruCv"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/02/federal-climate-deal-could-force-completion-of-mountain-valley-pipeline/">Federal climate deal could force completion of Mountain Valley Pipeline</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Schumer said in his floor speech that he’d work with Manchin and others “to have conversations about the best way to ensure responsible permitting reform is passed before the end of the year.” West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said language could be attached to the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual policy bill for the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley said in a statement removing Manchin&#8217;s permitting reform bill from the government spending package was the &#8220;right move&#8221; and urged leaders to keep it off &#8220;any future ‘must-pass’ legislation.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Many would agree that our permitting system could be improved,&#8221; Merkley said. &#8220;If the Senate is going to take up these questions in the future, it must be with a deliberative committee process and a robust, stand-alone floor debate that gives the American people, and especially those most impacted by this legislation, a full opportunity to weigh in.”</p>
<p>Kaine issued a statement shortly after the vote saying that &#8220;like so many Virginians, I&#8217;m relieved we defeated the attempt to greenlight the Mountain Valley Pipeline without normal administrative and judicial review. Now we can move on and fulfill our responsibility to fund the government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said in a statement that the U.S. &#8220;still need(s) to take sensible steps to reduce European dependence on Russian energy while maintaining an affordable and resilient supply here at home&#8221; and said he intends to continue work on reforms &#8220;that protect our national and economic security, but also respect concerns voiced by those communities most impacted by these projects.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Kaine pipeline objections</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Many lawmakers had urged the removal of Manchin’s permitting reform bill from the must-pass government funding package for weeks. Earlier this month, more than 70 <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/third-us-house-democrats-oppose-manchin-permitting-deal-stopgap-spending-bill" target="_blank">progressive Democrats signed onto a letter </a>that asked party leaders to keep Manchin’s bill out of the funding package that must become law before Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Kaine has repeatedly rebuked the bill, saying its requirement of approval for the Mountain Valley Pipeline &#8220;<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/kaine-says-mountain-valley-pipeline-provision-in-manchin-bill-could-open-the-door-to-serious-abuse-and-even-corruption/" target="_blank">could open the door to serious abuse and even corruption.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The 303-mile Mountain Valley Pipeline, which is intended to carry natural gas from the Marcellus shale fields of West Virginia to southern Virginia, has been a major point of contention in Virginia for years. Facing numerous court challenges from opponents, Mountain Valley has repeatedly lost federal approvals and remains unfinished, with most of the incomplete portions of the line lying in Virginia&#8217;s Giles, Craig and Montgomery counties.</p>
<p>“The pipeline runs through Virginia for 100 miles and takes property from landowners, but I was not consulted as a deal was struck to approve it and thus not given an opportunity to share my constituents’ deep concerns,” Kaine said in a statement earlier in the day announcing he’d vote against the package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure id="attachment_33118" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:666px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kaine_MVP_floor.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-33118" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kaine_MVP_floor.png" alt="" width="666" height="358" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kaine_MVP_floor.png 666w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kaine_MVP_floor-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 666px) 100vw, 666px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine speaks on the U.S. Senate floor about legislation from West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin that would force completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline.</p></figure>
<p>Kaine then urged Senate leaders to pass a funding package “free of the unprecedented and dangerous MVP deal.”</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, also rejected the permitting reform part of the package, saying from the Senate floor Tuesday afternoon before Schumer removed the bill that it was a &#8220;poison pill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What our Democratic colleagues have produced is a phony fig leaf that would actually set back the cause of real permitting reform,&#8221; McConnell said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and 17 other Republican attorneys general including Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/jeff-landry-gets-republican-ags-oppose-manchins-energy-permit-reforms" target="_blank">sent a letter to U.S. Senate leaders</a> Tuesday opposing Manchin&#8217;s energy permitting bill on the grounds that it &#8220;would effectively create a backdoor Clean Power Plan,&#8221; overrule &#8220;states&#8217; traditional authority to set their own resource and utility policies, and upset the careful balance of state and federal authority that has been a cornerstone of the Federal Power Act for nearly a century.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Government funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The overall spending package, if approved by the U.S. Senate and U.S. House this week, would fund the government through Dec. 16. The measure must become law before Friday at midnight, when current federal spending authority expires, to avoid a funding lapse or a partial government shutdown.</p>
<p>That is a scenario Democratic leaders wanted to avoid, especially with just weeks to go before the November midterm elections.</p>
<p>The spending package, released just before midnight Monday night, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/billions-natural-disasters-home-energy-included-stopgap-spending-bill-congress" target="_blank">would provide billions in funding </a>to ease home heating and cooling costs for low-income households, pay for community block disaster grants and continue recovery efforts related to the Hermit’s Peak/Calf Canyon Fire that damaged much of New Mexico this spring.</p>
<p>It includes $12 billion in Ukraine aid, the third installment this year, bringing the total U.S. investment in the country’s war effort to about $66 billion.</p>
<p>Congress approved a $13.6 billion <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471" target="_blank">relief package </a>in March, just weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, and another $40 billion <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-clears-40b-ukraine-aid-bidens-signature-some-gop-balk" target="_blank">package</a> in May — both with broad bipartisan support.</p>
<p>The Biden administration requested this tranche of Ukraine assistance funding total $11.7 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers also opted to include $35 million “to respond to potential nuclear and radiological incidents in Ukraine, assist Ukrainian partners with security of nuclear and radiological materials, and prevent illicit smuggling of nuclear and radiological material.”</p>
<p>The package does not include $22.4 billion in COVID-19 funding or $4.5 billion for the monkeypox outbreak, both of which <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/white-house-requests-47-billion-emergency-funding-ukraine-vaccines-and-more" target="_blank">were requested by the White House</a> and broadly rejected by Republicans.</p>
<p>Senate Appropriations Chairman Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said Tuesday he believes leaving out that public health funding is “shortsighted.”</p>
<p>Leahy said he would “revisit” the issue in December when Congress is supposed to have agreement on a full-year funding package.</p>
<figure id="attachment_31258" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CapitolCloserLight2-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-31258" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CapitolCloserLight2-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CapitolCloserLight2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CapitolCloserLight2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CapitolCloserLight2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CapitolCloserLight2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CapitolCloserLight2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CapitolCloserLight2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, March 26, 2022 (Photo by Marisa Demarco / Source New Mexico)</p></figure>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Avoiding a shutdown</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The short-term spending bill, sometimes referred to as a continuing resolution, or CR, is needed to prevent a government shutdown when the current spending law expires at the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.</p>
<p>The stopgap is intended to give lawmakers and the Biden administration more time to reach an agreement on how much the federal government should spend during fiscal year 2023, which begins Oct. 1, and where any increases in funding should be directed.</p>
<p>Bipartisan agreement on total discretionary spending levels, $1.512 trillion for the current fiscal year, would then allow the 12 panels in charge of an annual government spending bill to begin drafting legislation to fund dozens of departments and agencies.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/budget_fy2023.pdf" target="_blank">budget request </a>for the upcoming fiscal year asked Congress to approve $795 billion for defense programs and $915 billion for nondefense programs, which includes spending on the Homeland Security, Justice and Veterans Affairs departments.</p>
<p>Current law provides for $782 billion for defense spending and $730 billion for nondefense funding.</p>
<p>If Congress and the White House cannot reach agreement on the bills before their new December deadline, they can pass another short-term spending bill that would extend into 2023.</p>
<p>That type of funding strategy, however, poses problems for many federal departments, including the Pentagon. Since the short-term stopgap spending bills continue current spending levels and policies into the new fiscal year, federal departments typically can’t start new programs or boost spending in areas they targeted for additional funding in the budget request.</p>
