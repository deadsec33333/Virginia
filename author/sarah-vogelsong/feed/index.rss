<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency argues its policies, which permit the firing of an employee if they don’t agree to a strip search when a body scan shows an “anomaly” in an individual’s body cavity, are “gender-neutral,” allowing “consensual strip searches of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">any</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> employee, regardless of gender.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the department says, the three women have offered “no statistical data demonstrating that women are treated less favorably under the facially neutral policy than men.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to questions from the Mercury about how many strip searches VDOC conducted over the past five years and what percentages of those searches were on biological women and biological men, the agency’s FOIA officer, Colleen Maxwell, said in an email that the department “does not have any records responsive to your request because the records do not exist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pursuant to § 2.2-3704(D) of the Code of Virginia, ‘no public body shall be required to create a new record if the record does not already exist,’” Maxwell wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit brought by Mallory Patterson and Emily Comer, two former VDOC employees, and current employee Carla McDowney contends that women are disproportionately impacted by the agency’s body scanning procedures, which authorize a strip search of an employee if the scanner shows the employee has an object in his or her body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If an employee refuses to undergo such a search, the [standard operating procedure] permits VDOC to bar the person from the correctional facility or to terminate their employment,” three attorneys from Williams Mullen law firm, who are representing the corrections department, wrote in their most recent filing in the case with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterson, Comer and McDowney say that because the body-scanning technology used by the department cannot distinguish between contraband like drugs and menstrual products such as tampons, menstrual cups and intrauterine devices, multiple women have been strip searched and in some cases terminated for using menstrual or birth control products. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one should have their job threatened, be subjected to a strip search, or have their employment terminated simply because they are menstruating, using a feminine hygiene product, or using a contraceptive device at work,” they argued in their lawsuit. “Such conduct is sex discrimination in violation of federal law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterson, a former therapeutic counselor at Indian Creek Correctional Center in Chesapeake, was strip searched after a body scanner flagged her menstrual cup. She later resigned as a result of the experience. McDowney, a correctional officer in training at Haynesville Correctional Center in Richmond County, was strip searched after the scanner flagged her tampon and sanitary pad. And Comer, a former licensed practical nurse at State Farm Correctional Center in Goochland County, was flagged by a body scanner while wearing an IUD and three days later was terminated “due to suspicious body scans.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three women are also seeking to open a class action lawsuit against the Virginia Department of Corrections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department, however, says there is no evidence of intentional sex discrimination or a pattern of “less favorable treatment towards women” compared to men, none of the women’s allegations “demonstrate sufficiently severe or pervasive conduct that altered the terms of conditions of their employment” such that they could claim they experienced a “hostile work environment,” and the body scanner policy serves the state’s “well-established and legitimate interest” in keeping drugs out of prisons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standard operating procedure for use of the body scanners “applies equally to all sexes and genders,” the department wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plaintiffs were searched or terminated from their facility not because of their sex, but because a body scanner detected an unknown or anomalous object. Gender played no part in their experiences,” attorneys wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor, they contend, did the strip searches of Patterson and McDowney rise to the level of an “adverse employment action” — an act that “adversely affect[s] the terms, conditions, or benefits of the plaintiff’s employment” — needed to make a discrimination claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These searches did not affect Plaintiffs’ employment conditions in a manner equivalent to hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a significant change in benefits,” said VDOC in its filing. While “the strip searches were conducted pursuant to the [standard operating procedure], and although they were likely unpleasant and uncomfortable, they do not constitute an adverse employment action as a matter of law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the department said, the body scans and the strip searches authorized in the case of anomalies are justified because of the important role they play in reducing the flow of drugs into prisons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is “the unfortunate truth that illegal material is sometimes smuggled in by a prison’s own employees,” said VDOC, noting a Jan. 3, 2024 attempt by a female employee to smuggle tobacco into the Indian Creek Correctional Center by “secreting it in her groin area.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is inappropriate in one environment may be appropriate — or even necessary — in another,” the department wrote in a March 14 filing. “Here, Plaintiffs do not work in a corporate office building. They worked at a prison where the risk of contraband smuggling is all too real and all too dangerous. … The use of body scans and strip searches may seem invasive, but they are necessary precautions to protect staff, prisoners, and the public from the flow of drugs, weapons, and other contraband into the prison system.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Flores case</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterson, Comer and McDowney, however, say a September 2022 ruling by a jury that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/20/virginia-prison-agency-discriminated-against-female-employee-in-tampon-case-jury-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOC had discriminated against dental hygienist Joyce Flores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it fired her after a body scanner at Augusta Correctional Center detected a tampon she was wearing clearly establish “discrimination in employment on the basis of menstruation and related conditions is sex discrimination in violation of federal law.” </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ppXg3X8GQ6"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/20/virginia-prison-agency-discriminated-against-female-employee-in-tampon-case-jury-rules/">Virginia prison agency discriminated against female employee in tampon case, jury rules</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia prison agency discriminated against female employee in tampon case, jury rules&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/20/virginia-prison-agency-discriminated-against-female-employee-in-tampon-case-jury-rules/embed/#?secret=QJtAkTUfIp#?secret=ppXg3X8GQ6" data-secret="ppXg3X8GQ6" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To discriminate against an employee because of a sex-linked trait is to discriminate against an employee because of sex in contravention of Title VII,” wrote Paul Falabella, an attorney for the three women who also represented Flores in the prior case, in a March 8 filing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed in particular to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County — a landmark case in which an employee of Clayton County, Georgia, was fired from his job after promoting a gay softball league he had joined — that found that when determining whether sex discrimination occurred, “it doesn’t matter if the employer treated women as a group the same when compared to men as a group.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the employer intentionally relies in part on an individual employee’s sex when deciding to discharge the employee — put differently, if changing the employee’s sex would have yielded a different choice by the employer — a statutory violation has occurred,” </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote Justice Neil Gorsuch in the 6-3 opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his most recent filing, Falabella said that under that standard, “if we changed Plaintiffs’ sex to male, the result here would change because a male employee does not menstruate, use feminine hygiene products, or use internal contraceptive devices and therefore would not be discriminated against for same.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOC says that’s an incorrect understanding of the Bostock ruling, and that the Flores case is different from the current one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Using the Bostock test, if we changed Plaintiffs’ sex to male, and an anomaly or unknown object was detected by the body scanner, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the exact same result would occur</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” the agency wrote in a March 14 filing. “They would be subject to search. … There is simply no causal connection between the alleged strip searches of Patterson and McDowney and their gender.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the department said, the court should follow a federal court ruling out of Georgia in Coleman v. Bobby Dodd Institute. In that case, a woman claimed she had suffered sex discrimination when she was fired from a 911 call center job by the Bobby Dodd Institute, an employment agency, after heavy periods linked to menopause caused her to leak blood onto a company chair and onto a carpet on the way to the bathroom. The Georgia-based court dismissed her suit, finding she hadn’t adequately proved sex discrimination. Coleman </span><a href="https://www.acluga.org/sites/default/files/appeal_brief.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appealed the ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the two parties </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/woman-settles-with-employer-she-says-fired-her-for-getting-period-work/afsPqA1kEa6mz0erIGMNaO/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">later reached a confidential settlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Falabella also argued that the choice presented to Patterson and McDowney did constitute an adverse employment action that met federal standards for a sex discrimination claim.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The context of the threats of termination is about as unique, humiliating, and dire as could occur in a place of employment — Patterson and McDowney had to either strip naked in the workplace in front of corrections officers, remove soiled feminine hygiene products from their vaginas while menstruating or be subject to termination from employment (and possible criminal investigation),” he wrote.</span></p>

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal animal welfare officials last year withdrew special permission given to researchers at Eastern Virginia Medical School that allowed them to conduct repeat cesarean section surgeries on five baboons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May 2023, the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which is responsible for ensuring researchers comply with the federal Animal Welfare Act, notified EVMS it was withdrawing a special exception it had granted scientists at the school to conduct more than one “major operative procedure” on each of the baboons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That exception had allowed researchers to conduct up to six C-sections on each baboon. After the sixth C-section, the study design allows the baboons to be euthanized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The medical school has justified the repeat surgeries as necessary for pregnancy research that’s not possible with human subjects, but federal regulators ruled the researchers weren’t following specific procedures necessary to ensure animal welfare. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One animal “lost 18% of her body weight after her first pregnancy and caesarean section, but the weight loss was never addressed,” APHIS Acting Deputy Administrator Roxanne Mullaney wrote to the school July 7. “The animal had a second pregnancy while still underweight, and subsequently died from aspiration immediately following the second caesarean section.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mullaney also said inspectors had identified cases where researchers didn’t document how medical problems that emerged either prior to or after surgery were resolved.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Accordingly, APHIS had no choice but to withdraw its approval of the exception,” she wrote in July. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EVMS did not respond to repeated inquiries about the experiments from the Mercury. However, in correspondence with federal officials obtained by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and shared with the Mercury, EVMS has defended the C-sections as necessary to its research, which has been ongoing since the 1980s and is supported by federal funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study examines the role estrogen plays in the development of offspring by treating pregnant baboons with the hormone or a drug that inhibits the body from synthesizing estrogen. Offspring of treated and untreated animals are delivered by C-section at various stages of the pregnancy or allowed to develop into adulthood, with scientists examining placenta, fetal tissues and, in the case of animals allowed to mature, other developmental indicators like blood vessel flow and glucose regulation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do recognize there must be limits on the number of pregnancies and surgical cesarean sections any one animal should undergo and thus we cannot perform each and every proposed treatment in any one animal,” wrote EVMS Vice Dean for Research and Institutional Official William Wasilenko in a December 2021 letter to APHIS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he said, being able to perform multiple experimental treatments on the baboons is necessary to understand how estrogen impacts pregnancy and fetal development in humans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While tissues can be collected from women who suffer from conditions like spontaneous abortion or preeclampsia and undergo a C-section, Wasilenko said those studies can’t show “cause:effect” when it comes to estrogen and complications.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot do any major experimental manipulations/treatments in humans to test cause:effect,” he wrote. “Thus, to do similar studies in the baboon, i.e. study them once and/or limit experimental treatment within acceptable reason, would almost be the same as that done in humans and a reason not to use the baboon.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, researchers have maintained that performing multiple procedures on the same animal reduces the overall number of baboons impacted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Multiple use of the same baboon reduces the total number of animals required to conduct the study and still permit collection of statistically valid data,” an application to the school’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee states. “Thus, we study the role of estrogen in the same baboon (i.e., experiments are interrelated/integrated) during control periods (e.g., on days 60 and ~170 of gestation). One animal rather than 5 animals are studied. Multiple pregnancies also mimic the situation in humans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PETA, however, has condemned the research, saying that “EVMS has turned a blind eye to these animals’ suffering for long enough” and “it is time to shut down this laboratory and release the aging baboons to a reputable sanctuary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The university’s own records on the baboons contain notes such as ‘self-injurious behavior,’ ‘self-trauma,’ ‘ulcers,’ ‘genital tears,’ ‘missing tips of…fingers,’ ‘anorexia,’ ‘biting cage bars,’ ‘repetitive circling,’ and more,” said Daphna Nachminovitch, a spokeswoman for the organization. “PETA believes there remain four elderly survivors — Jemma, Cookie, Toya, and Tara — whose existence has been nothing but fear and misery, and who may be used in a ‘terminal’ experiment any day now.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Records PETA shared with the Mercury also show federal officials have repeatedly raised flags about the experiment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, APHIS issued a critical violation to the university over repeated C-sections performed on three adult female baboons. And in February 2022, Carol Clarke, a senior staff officer with APHIS, reached out to officials with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare at the National Institutes of Health to voice “concerns about animal health and well-being.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They want to perform up to 6 successive C-sections on 5 baboons to study estradiol events on fetus and the [mother],” wrote Clark. “Despite responses to our questions, we are still unclear why 6 C-sections are necessary and how an animal that undergoes C-sections annually can serve as its ‘own control’ as they state. The study design and scientific justification are hard to follow. We are very concerned about pain/distress and whether 6 C-sections on one animal are adequately scientifically justified.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, in June 2022, APHIS’ then-Administrator Betty Goldentyre granted EVMS a special exception to a regulatory requirement limiting an animal to one major operative procedure. Goldentyre’s exception let the researchers conduct up to six C-sections on the five baboons, as long as they met certain conditions. </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/taking-action/usda-official-who-oversaw-envigo-inspections-in-cumberland-to-step-down/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">She later stepped down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after national outcry over the treatment of beagles bred for medical experimentation at a facility run by Envigo in Cumberland County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a year later, APHIS notified the medical school it was withdrawing the exceptions after inspectors found researchers had been drawing blood from two of the baboons far more frequently than planned, the animals’ weights were not being monitored weekly and one baboon who had been administered a drug and was subsequently found unresponsive in her cage was not treated according to required procedures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EVMS appealed two of those findings, arguing researchers had interpreted a limitation on blood draws occuring at a “2-4 day interval” differently from APHIS but had not exceeded monthly limits approved by the school’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Additionally, the school said, the baboon found unresponsive in her cage had recovered by the time the attending veterinarian had arrived, when she was “quiet, alert, and responsive” and eating apples. Following treatment protocols that would have required the sedation of the baboon, officials argued, would have gone against the veterinarian’s professional medical opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We attribute the success of the surgeries performed to date and the overall well-being of the animals assigned to the protocol to excellent care and management provided by the investigative and veterinary care staff and carefully coordinated oversight provided by the IACUC,” the school wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">APHIS rejected the appeal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exception, wrote Mullaney in the July 7 letter, “was withdrawn based on the observations of the inspectors, including the agency’s nonhuman primate specialist. Those observations will not change, regardless of the outcome of the appeals process.” </span></p>
<p>In September 2022, according to <a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2022/09/20/national-animal-rights-group-petitions-evms-to-end-testing-on-baboons/" target="_blank">reporting by The Virginian-Pilot</a>, an animal rights group submitted a petition with 40,000 signatures to EVMS&#8217; board of visitors, demanding that it stop using baboons in both the pregnancy study and other research on microplastics.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a case involving a flea infestation of an Alexandria rental, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that lease agreements can’t override state law requiring that landlords keep their properties “in a fit and habitable condition.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Virginia Residential Landlord Tenant Act, tenants must “take an active role in keeping the dwelling unit free from pests by prompt notifying the landlord of any infestations,” wrote Judge Doris Henderson Causey in </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1687224.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a unanimous decision by a three-judge panel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, she concluded, the law makes it clear that “it is ultimately the landlord’s duty to keep the premises habitable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s ruling stems from a conflict over a lease for a single-family home in Alexandria that Mikeya Vance rented from landlord Christopher Parrish in September 2021. According to court records, Vance moved into the property Oct. 15, 2021 and immediately observed fleas in her bed. She then left the property Oct. 25 and notified Parrish of the infestation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The account of events provided by the appeals court outlines a string of extermination attempts undertaken by both Vance and Parrish. Vance first asked to end her lease Nov. 17, but Parrish refused. On Jan. 5, 2022, she filed a complaint against her landlord in Fairfax County General District Court seeking to terminate her lease and recover the rent she had paid during the infestation. While the district court ruled against her, the county circuit court later ruled in her favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In appealing that decision, Parrish argued that Vance was responsible for dealing with the infestation, since the lease the two had signed stated the tenant would have the responsibility of “controlling and eliminating household pests including but not limited to fleas, ticks, bed bugs, roaches, silverfish, ants, crickets, and rodents during occupancy” and would be on the hook for “costs of the elimination of all such pests and vermin.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vance in turn contended that Virginia’s Residential Landlord Tenant Act requires landlords to keep properties habitable and forbids that responsibility from being transferred to tenants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court agreed. “When a lease provision purports to waive [a] tenant’s rights or remedies required by law, the law controls and the lease provision is unenforceable,” Causey wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the duties of a landlord that can’t be waived are the duty to “keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition,” she concluded. The presence of fleas, she found, “certainly can render the premises uninhabitable” because of the diseases they can carry.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here, the lease agreement between Parrish and Vance attempted to shift the burden to deal with insect infestations to Vance,” Causey wrote. “However, the lease could not do so because Vance did not waive the warranty of habitability by signing the lease agreement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court also rejected another argument by Parrish that the circuit court hadn’t had sufficient evidence to determine the fleas had been there prior to Vance moving in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a hearing on the case this past September, Vance’s attorney, Karen Leiser, argued that the circuit court hadn’t been unreasonable in its ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If the tenant had somehow brought the fleas with her or had caused an infestation in some way, it is possible that that burden would shift to her to remediate the problem, but that is not what the trial court found,” Leiser told the appeals court. “The trial court found that the fleas must have already been there, and therefore it was the landlord’s obligation under the statute to remedy that problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Causey concluded that even though Parrish “asserts that Vance caused the flea infestation, the circuit court was entitled to credit” other testimony “that the flea activity had been ongoing for months, even before Vance took possession of the property.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin to bring the Washington Wizards and Capitals to Alexandria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s no shortage of other things to find in what is always the year’s biggest piece of legislation. The </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/get/amendmentpdf/4922/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">417-page rundown of amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Youngkin’s December proposal reflects a host of Democratic wishes, many of which the governor is certain to axe ahead of the legislature’s April veto session. Those include money for the legalization of cannabis sales, minimum wage increases, the creation of a state-run paid family and medical leave program and the setting up of a Prescription Drug Affordability Board. Others, like the earmarking of extra money to over a dozen health departments facing rising rents for their facilities, are more humdrum and will have a better chance of surviving the governor’s pen.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Youngkin budget calls for income tax cuts, sales tax increases&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/embed/#?secret=uKx2UyOeL4#?secret=fe4HPoHcOY" data-secret="fe4HPoHcOY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s a sampling of the many projects, priorities and policy changes Democrats are seeking through this year’s budget. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly budget rejects two of Youngkin’s three major tax proposals — a 12% across-the-board income tax cut and an increase in the state’s sales and use tax from 4.3% to 5.2% — but embraces his idea of expanding the state sales tax to digital goods and services to close what Youngkin in December called the “Big Tech tax loophole.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new tax would affect goods such as software packages, digital downloads and streaming services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Youngkin warned the General Assembly in January that he saw his tax proposals as “a package deal” and was “only interested in a plan that reduces taxes for Virginians.” Since the legislature released its plans Thursday, he has been sharply critical of its tax provisions, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-budget-taxes-arena-lucas-general-assembly/article_29816972-dd88-11ee-8b6b-e382afb7c33d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accusing the General Assembly of raising taxes by $2 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by adopting the digital goods tax and arguing the provision will impact low- and moderate-income Virginians more than higher-income ones. While his plan would have instituted a digital tax, Youngkin has said its impacts would have been balanced by the income tax cuts and proposed increases in the earned income tax credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have also found fault with the General Assembly’s elimination of a provision that would have exempted businesses from the digital tax.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More teacher pay increases and education spending</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly budget would put an additional $2.5 billion toward education to increase salaries for teachers and support positions and put extra funding toward schools with large low-income and disadvantaged populations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were able to pump hundreds of millions of dollars extra to fully fund our promise to try to bring teachers to the national average,” said House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke. “We are modernizing the way we approach educating English language learners; we are pumping large investments into at-risk students, who need us the most — their schools, their teachers are going to be getting a nice bump to ensure that we&#8217;re pushing education equity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget calls for public school teachers and support professionals to receive a 3% salary increase in each of the next two years. School divisions would be required to provide a local match. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s budget had called for a 1% bonus for teachers in fiscal year 2025 and a 2% raise in fiscal year 2026. His office said teacher pay remains a “key priority” and the administration is working on recommendations for “innovative solutions for teacher recruitment and retention” to be shared in the fall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly is accepting Youngkin’s proposal to have the Superintendent of Public Instruction provide a detailed annual report on teacher salaries, including average salaries by school division and school, comparisons with other states, and starting salaries by school division; however, it rejected a study the administration wanted on teacher compensation and its impact on student achievement. </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/17/legislation-to-bring-va-teacher-pay-to-national-average-gets-bipartisan-support/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bring salaries for teachers and non-instructional support positions to the national average or higher is awaiting review by Youngkin</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers also proposed an additional $371.3 million over the biennium to implement several recommendations from a state study that found Virginia was underfunding school divisions. The changes would combine several existing programs with the aim of routing more money to divisions with large numbers of low-income or otherwise disadvantaged students. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another big-ticket item would provide about $546 million to K-12 education from the general fund over the biennium to make up for funding losses divisions incurred when the General Assembly got rid of part of the state grocery tax in January 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In higher education, lawmakers are proposing an additional $205.4 million over the biennium to increase access, affordability and the ability for students to earn a degree. The proposal helps prevent increased costs for in-state students and includes $40 million in support for historically black colleges and universities.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Child care and early childhood education </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s budget included major investments in child care and early childhood education ahead of the wind-down of significant federal child care subsidies and supports that were put in place during the pandemic. The General Assembly budget increases those investments by another $74 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new budget would also put $25 million toward the creation of a child care center for state employees in Richmond, using space on the campus of Reynolds Community College. The Department of Housing and Community Development would be charged with issuing recommendations by 2025 on how to retrofit spaces on other community college campuses to provide child care for community college students and the broader public. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Rejoining RGGI</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language in the budget would mandate that Virginia rejoin the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate carbon market that requires power plants to purchase allowances for every ton of carbon they emit in regular auctions. The proceeds of the auctions are then returned to the states; in Virginia, they are used for flood resilience and energy efficiency efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats passed a law directing the state to participate in RGGI in 2020. Youngkin pulled the state out of the market at the end of last year through the regulatory process, arguing it represented a “hidden tax” because Virginia lets utilities pass allowance costs on to customers. Environmental groups are challenging the withdrawal in court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To replace RGGI revenues in the near term, the General Assembly budget includes a proposal from Youngkin to put $100 million toward the Community Flood Preparedness Fund.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More money for Medicaid</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Medicaid enrollment is higher than expected, the General Assembly budget authorizes an extra $150 million in fiscal year 2025 for the program. Medicaid enrollment was expected to decline significantly this year as pandemic-era prohibitions on kicking people off the rolls if they didn’t meet criteria expired. However, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-medicaid-youngkin-metro-general-assembly/article_0fabedc4-da40-11ee-be52-ab397008d06f.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as The Richmond Times-Dispatch has reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enrollment has been higher than projected, particularly for children, meaning Virginia will likely have to chip in more to keep the state-run program afloat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other spending would include more than $22 million over the next two years for the state to contract with a third party to help ensure state coverage decisions are “timely and accurate,” $1 million to hire a consultant to review Virginia’s eligibility determination system and about $20 million to go toward streamlining call center and mail processing for the Department of Social Services. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Behavioral health funding</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly has left largely intact Youngkin’s proposals to ramp up spending under his “Right Help, Right Now” initiative to expand Virginians’ access to behavioral health resources and relieve pressure on the state’s strained mental health hospitals. Plans backed by both the governor and the legislature include a major expansion of developmental disability waivers, which fund services for people with long-term care needs, and significant spending on crisis stabilization services and other efforts to increase investment in more local behavioral health resources like community services boards.  </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Metro</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly wants to send an extra $149.5 million over the next two years to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which operates Metro. Metro, which serves roughly 1.5 million passengers each week in Northern Virginia, is facing a $750 million shortfall and has asked Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C. for more funding.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="doLYIjGaiG"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/11/council-suggests-virginia-reset-subsidy-payments-to-metro-amid-budget-shortfall/">Council suggests Virginia reset subsidy payments to Metro amid budget shortfall</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Council suggests Virginia reset subsidy payments to Metro amid budget shortfall&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/11/council-suggests-virginia-reset-subsidy-payments-to-metro-amid-budget-shortfall/embed/#?secret=hu6SslLk0H#?secret=doLYIjGaiG" data-secret="doLYIjGaiG" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State code currently caps annual increases on Virginia’s funding for Metro at 3%. The General Assembly would let the state exceed that cap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s budget proposal did not include additional funding over what the state provides Metro, but it would’ve allowed Virginia to go above its cap if the transit agency provided a corrective action plan by Nov. 30. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers removed the governor’s language about the corrective action plan but ordered WMATA to conduct “a comparison of its total costs and overhead costs” with those of other transit systems in Boston, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia and San Francisco, and submit its findings to the Joint Subcommittee on Northern Virginia Public Transit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That subcommittee would be created under a resolution </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sj28" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the General Assembly aimed at studying “long-term, sustainable, dedicated funding and cost-containment controls and strategies” for public transit in the region.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Restoring Democrats’ earned sentence credit system for inmates</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reviving a long-running dispute over how much time certain inmates should be able to earn for good behavior, the General Assembly budget would get rid of restrictions imposed by Youngkin on people incarcerated for both nonviolent and violent offenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under a 2020 law backed by Democrats, Virginia began allowing inmates who demonstrated good behavior or participated in rehabilitation programs to reduce their sentences by more than the existing limit of 4.5 days for every 30 days served. The new system let certain incarcerated people earn up to 15 days of credit every 30 days that could be applied to sentences for nonviolent offenses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while the law prohibited sentences linked to certain violent crimes like murder from being reduced through the credit program, debate emerged over whether inmates with mixed sentences — those imposed for both violent and nonviolent crimes — should be allowed to earn the enhanced credits in any capacity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Youngkin’s request, the General Assembly in 2022 at the last minute passed budget language prohibiting inmates with mixed sentences from earning the enhanced credits to reduce any sentence they had received. Hundreds of inmates who had been notified they would be released within weeks under the new system were suddenly told they would instead have to serve the remainder of their terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly budget would reimpose the original system, in which those inmates could reduce the sentences they received for nonviolent offenses through the enhanced credits but would have to serve the full sentences attached to their violent crimes. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Incentivizing farmers to adopt pollution reduction practices</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has devoted record amounts of funding in recent years to help farmers install best management practices to reduce pollution from entering the Chesapeake Bay. This year’s budget also includes hundreds of millions for this aim, while devoting $20 million in new funding to a new pilot program to pay agricultural producers that achieve actual pollution reductions.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Moving up the schedule for a polystyrene ban</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators aren’t done wrangling over when Virginia should prohibit restaurants from using  takeout containers made of polystyrene, a type of plastic foam that takes hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, as part of what was dubbed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/02/24/advanced-recycling-bill-goes-to-governor-after-great-polystyrene-compromise-of-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Great Polystyrene Compromise,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the General Assembly decided that large food service establishments — defined as those with 20 or more locations — would have to stop using polystyrene containers by July 1, 2023, while smaller establishments would have until July 1, 2025. But budgets passed by both the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate in 2022 pushed back those deadlines until July 2028 and July 2030. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s budget calls for the new deadlines to be set as 2025 for large establishments and 2026 for small ones. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Moving various state bodies out of executive branch control</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous amendments in the General Assembly budget would move the Department of General Services, Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority and Cannabis Control Authority out from under executive branch control to a new status as independent agencies without ties to a particular secretariat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DGS provisions appear to be part of a fight that’s unfolded between the General Assembly and Youngkin over who gets to decide where and how state employees are housed. Employees in agencies including the Department of Education who have been working at the Monroe Building in downtown Richmond have been </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/virginia-general-assembly-james-monroe-building-youngkin/article_1fad9e04-dd9a-11ee-9893-1b64ad91db1e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caught in the crosshairs of the dispute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No executive branch agency shall be relocated permanently from the Monroe Building unless otherwise authorized by the General Assembly,” the budget reads. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Toll relief</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fulfilling a wish of Senate Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the General Assembly budget would expand toll relief for Virginians in the Hampton Roads area by providing an additional $101 million over the next two years to support eligible drivers who earn less than $50,000 per year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the budget, when combined with the state’s existing </span><a href="https://www.vdottollrelief.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toll Relief program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, eligible drivers could get a 100% toll rebate for up to 14 trips per week through the Elizabeth River Tunnels until 2036. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No Richmond CSO assistance</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not included in the budget is additional state funding for the city of Richmond to upgrade its combined sewer overflow system, which routes wastewater and stormwater through the same pipes. The legislature has required the city to upgrade its system by 2035 to prevent waste from getting discharged into the James River when heavy rainfall overwhelms the system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier versions of last year’s budget amendments included $100 million for the project, but it was cut from the final version. Youngkin had proposed $50 million for the project in this year’s budget plan.</span></p>

Robert E. Lee was taken off its pedestal Wednesday on Monument Avenue in Richmond. (Scott Elmquist/ Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation that would end Virginia’s issuance of two license plates that honor Robert E. Lee as “The Virginia Gentleman” and spotlight the Sons of Confederate Veterans is headed to Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s desk. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB812" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the second attempt by Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, to get rid of the Robert E. Lee plate, which was approved virtually unanimously by the General Assembly in 2007 but has become increasingly unpalatable to Democrats eager to cut ties between the modern state and its Confederate past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill is needed to help us end the false narrative of the Lost Cause and help us embrace the fact that General Lee was anything but a gentleman,” Mundon King said on the House floor earlier this month. “He was a traitor to this country, a brutal enslaver and not worthy of being celebrated on our license plate.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Mundon King’s legislation failed in the Republican-controlled House of Delegates. But since then, Democrats have won narrow control over both legislative chambers, and on Tuesday, the Senate voted 21-17 to forward the proposal to Youngkin. The Republican governor will now have to decide whether to allow it to become law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about the governor’s plans, Youngkin spokesperson Christian Martinez said only that Youngkin “will review any legislation that comes to his desk.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It won’t be the only bill dealing with Virginia’s Confederate history that the governor will have to make a decision on: On Monday, the Virginia House took a final vote on legislation that would strip the United Daughters of the Confederacy of a unique tax exemption written into state code that has allowed the organization to pay no property taxes on its Richmond headquarters for decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have largely opposed both measures, although a few in the House have backed the license plate bill, including Dels. Amanda Batten, R-James City; Rob Bloxom, R-Accomack; Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield; and A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton, the chamber’s only Black Republican. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, said getting rid of the license plates would violate constitutional free speech protections because the license plate program overseen by the state Department of Motor Vehicles “is a modern-day courthouse square” where people can share their views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we pass this bill, a citizen will sue Virginia, and they will use this debate to show the intent of this bill is to kill speech because some in this body did not like the message,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Tim Griffin, R-Bedford, similarly argued in a House committee debate that the legislation constituted “viewpoint discrimination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason that we have First Amendment protections of speech in general is so that we protect speech that not everybody likes,” he said. “There’s an abortion plate on there that I find disgusting personally, but I’m not going to move to remove it just because I don’t agree with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Mundon King noted the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled states have the right to regulate license plates because they represent government speech, not private speech. That case, Walker v. Sons of Confederate Veterans, freed up Virginia to enforce a law prohibiting specialty Sons of Confederate Veterans license plates </span><a href="https://www.arlnow.com/2015/07/31/judge-rules-in-favor-of-removing-confederate-flag-from-va-license-plates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from displaying the Confederate battle flag</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those plates were </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/with-redesign-va-lowering-confederate-flag-plate/291-221410074" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">replaced with a new design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that bore the group’s name and the silhouette of three soldiers on horseback. Under Mundon King’s legislation, the state would also stop issuing that design, although holders of both the SCV and Robert E. Lee plates would be free to use them until their expiration date. The changes would affect about 2,300 people: According to the DMV, there were 1,783 Robert E. Lee plates and 543 Sons of Confederate Veterans plates in circulation as of Feb. 27.</span></p>
<p>The Virginia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also make decisions on these plates all the time,” said Mundon King. “And what I’m simply asking is that we make a decision to leave the Confederacy in history books and not on license plates and not continue to venerate someone who is not worthy of being honored.” </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s yearslong push for tax cuts is still running up against stiff opposition in the General Assembly. His marquee proposal to bring a professional sports arena to Northern Virginia has gotten a mixed reception. And Democrats are still eager to show they’re doing more to boost funding for the state’s K-12 schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are not many big items the Republican governor and the Democratic legislature are going to agree on this year. But they have to reach a deal on a new, two-year budget, and the process of working out those details entered a new phase Sunday as Democratic leaders released their counterpoints to the budget Youngkin introduced late last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complete texts of the budget bills Democrats advanced Sunday were not yet available Monday but are expected to be released this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some high-level priorities Democrats laid out in their initial budget remarks and presentations:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">House and Senate split on arena, Metro funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House budget includes language necessary to advance the pending economic development deal that would create a new sports arena in Alexandria that would be the home of both the Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals. Specifically, the language would create the Virginia Sports and Entertainment Authority, a new public body that would help finance and oversee the arena project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate, which didn’t pass legislation that would pave the way for the deal, didn’t put the arena in its budget. That reflects the anti-arena stance taken by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, who chairs the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not going to let billionaires build their fortunes on the backs of our taxpayers’ dollars,” Lucas </span><a href="https://x.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/1759384567750832478?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told reporters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after Sunday’s budget presentations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arena deal envisions the authority issuing $2 billion in bonds to fund the project, with those bonds repaid through future revenues generated by the arena and nearby development. There is no upfront state investment in the deal, which means its inclusion in the budget doesn’t require lawmakers to majorly reallocate funds or raise taxes to pay for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several Democratic senators from Northern Virginia have indicated they’re still open to an arena deal, but whether it makes it into the final budget will depend on whether they can come to an agreement with Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a transportation funding debate tied to the arena, the House proposed $249.5 million over the next two years for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which operates the Metro transit system, to address its budgetary shortfalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin did not propose any additional funding above what Virginia pays the authority but would allow Virginia to give more if Metro provides a corrective action plan by Nov. 30 that includes cost-cutting measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate did not propose additional funding above what the state provides for the agency. Still, the upper chamber recommended leaders and the governor’s administration continue discussing financing around Metro and commuter changes post-pandemic. In addition, Senate budget writers recommended enhanced reporting and consultation requirements and temporarily lifting the cap on the allowed budget growth for the Metro system.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax cuts: out. Taxing digital goods and services: in.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Youngkin told the General Assembly this January that his wide-ranging tax reform plan was “a package deal” and he was “only interested in a plan that reduces taxes for Virginians,” both the House and Senate have ignored those desires. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EAvzGOW5DA"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/">Youngkin budget calls for income tax cuts, sales tax increases</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Youngkin budget calls for income tax cuts, sales tax increases&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/embed/#?secret=B1LW7faK6m#?secret=EAvzGOW5DA" data-secret="EAvzGOW5DA" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither chamber’s budget proposal includes the across-the-board 12% income tax cut the governor sought or a bump in the state sales tax meant to partially offset it. On Sunday, Lucas called the cuts “not sustainable,” citing a state commission’s July findings that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/10/study-finds-virginia-underfunds-k-12-schools-recommends-spending-billions-more/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is underfunding local school districts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the House and Senate are embracing Youngkin’s push to close what he has called the Big Tech loophole by extending the sales and use tax to digital goods like software packages, digital downloads and streaming services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On this the governor was correct,” said House Appropriations Chairman Luke Torian, D-Prince William Sunday. “It makes no sense to pay sales tax when you buy a Blu-Ray disc but don’t pay a tax when you download the same movie from a digital retailer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House GOP is characterizing the rejection of Youngkin’s proposed income tax cuts as “a $1.3 billion tax hike.” And the governor has signaled he hasn’t given up on the idea: In a Sunday evening statement, he said he would be reviewing the plans “through the lens that … Virginians can’t afford another tax increase and, in fact, need additional tax relief.”  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Big education spending</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats’ House and Senate proposals greatly increase education spending above the levels envisioned by Youngkin, which they say is needed to fill gaps in state funding to local divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The recent JLARC review of our funding formula demonstrated the need to modernize and update how we fund public education,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, referring to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. “It also has become apparent that we must do more to address teacher salaries to ensure we have a high-quality system of education for our students.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers are proposing incremental salary increases for teachers — 3% in the Senate and 3.375% in the House — to bring Virginia’s average teacher salary up to the national average in coming years. A House presentation Sunday specified the national average would be based on figures from the National Education Association, the primary teacher’s union in the U.S., and school divisions would have to provide at least 2% increases to access the state funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s plan includes a 2% salary increase for teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other major spending priorities include hundreds of millions extra for the state’s at-risk add-on, a bucket of money used to supplement funding to school divisions with high numbers of economically disadvantaged students. The House would put an additional $384 million toward that priority over the next two years, while the Senate would devote $200 million. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Agreement on early childhood care funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin made early childhood care a centerpiece of his budget proposal, calling for $412 million over the next two years for the state’s child care subsidy program to maintain current levels of care even as federal pandemic relief funds disappear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the House and Senate are embracing that proposal, with Locke saying Sunday the Senate “affirm[s] the funding provided in the introduced budget to support early childhood care and education and recommend[s] maintaining the current service level in the second year.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A fresh push for RGGI participation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and Republicans have been squabbling over whether Virginia should be part of the multistate carbon market known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, or RGGI, for years. Youngkin vowed to withdraw Virginia even before he took office and did so through regulation at the end of last year, although environmental groups are fighting the move in the courts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s House budget would direct the state to rejoin RGGI and projects $100 million in revenues from participation over the biennium. While Lucas has said the Senate budget doesn’t include that language, the chamber spent much of the past two years defending Virginia’s participation as a “brick wall” issue. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of those priorities are expected to win final passage in the weeks ahead, but they’re heading to an uncertain fate at the hands of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has not yet played a major role in the policymaking process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the governor pushing hard for a Northern Virginia sports arena deal, the story of the 2024 session could come down to whether Youngkin and Democratic leaders can strike a bargain that gives both sides some of what they want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that negotiating could be worked out through the state budget, which will take up more of legislators’ time in the session’s second half.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday was the deadline for the state Senate and House of Delegates to finish work on their bills before they cross over to be heard by the other body. Here’s a rundown of what’s happened on big issues so far: </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Sports arena</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation that would create a sports authority to issue $2 billion in bonds to build a new arena for the Washington Wizards and Capitals in Alexandria has been one of the most closely watched proposals of the session. Backed by Youngkin, the project envisions the construction of not only the arena, but a new entertainment district in the Potomac Yard neighborhood that the governor says could produce $12 billion in revenues over the coming decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authority bill has cleared the House with a reenactment clause that would require the General Assembly to approve the proposal again in 2025 for the project to move forward. But it died in the Senate after Finance and Appropriations Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, said </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/nova-arena-proposal-runs-into-trouble-as-top-senate-democrat-presses-pause/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she wouldn’t bring it to a vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing concerns with the project’s financing and what she and Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, described as Youngkin’s unwillingness to negotiate with Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, some members of the Senate have signified they aren’t abandoning the arena idea. “To quote Eric Idle — it’s not dead yet,” Surovell </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/02/12/monumental-arena-youngkin-bowser-bill-general-assembly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Monday. “We are always open to talking about ways to try to alleviate our concerns, but the conversations need to happen ASAP.”</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Taxes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin came into the 2024 legislative session </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking major tax reforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: an across-the-board 12% cut in income taxes, a bump in the state sales and use tax from 4.3% to 5.2%, and an expansion of the sales and use tax to digital goods like digital downloads and streaming services. He also proposed eradication of the widely disliked car tax, a goal that has eluded</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/20/two-words-for-local-governments-considering-keeping-windfall-car-tax-collections-jim-gilmore/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> former Republican governors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and would require more than one piece of legislation to accomplish.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-tax-cuts-virginia-budget-general-assembly/article_8554e5fa-c4f4-11ee-a464-0b251d3ab4b3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats rejected bills to carry out much of that agenda</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which they have complained would disproportionately harm lower-income people. While the ideas remain alive in the governor’s budget proposal, their prospects appear dim as the House and Senate prepare to unveil their own two-year spending plans on Sunday. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Banning legacy admissions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation to ban the practice of providing special treatment in college admissions decisions to applicants related to alumni and donors is on course to reach the governor after both chambers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/blog-va/bills-banning-legacy-admissions-clear-both-virginia-chambers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unanimously backed the proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legislation passes for a second time and the governor signs it into law, all of Virginia’s public colleges and universities would be prohibited from engaging in the admissions practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education Reform Now, a think tank, says more than 100 colleges and universities have ended legacy admissions since 2015, but 787 still used the practice as of 2020.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gambling</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a major policy reversal for the General Assembly, skill games — the slots-like machines tucked into corners of gas stations and bars all over the state — appear to be on track to be fully legalized, taxed and regulated. Lawmakers have signaled </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/13/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-lift-ban-on-skill-games-but-details-are-uncertain/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">broad, bipartisan support for repealing a skill game ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that first took effect in 2021, but they haven’t finalized the details of how tough or lenient the new regulatory structure should be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers punted on a proposal to allow a voter referendum on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/06/virginia-senate-postpones-northern-virginia-casino-plan-until-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a potential casino in Fairfax County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, blocked an effort to allow </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/30/virginia-house-panel-scuttles-plan-for-cruise-ship-casinos-in-state-waters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cruise ship casinos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to operate in Virginia waters and again said no to the idea of allowing sports betting on college games involving Virginia schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Richmond voters said no to a casino twice, legislators have advanced a bill to give Petersburg voters a chance to weigh in on whether their city should host a casino in the capital region. Another piece of legislation moving forward would take Richmond off the state’s list of cities allowed to pursue casinos.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Guns</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaving </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/02/17/va-senate-committee-blocks-assault-weapon-bill-4-democrats-vote-to-push-it-to-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">past caution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behind, Democrats have passed dozens of new gun control bills, many of which are almost certain to be vetoed by the governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those proposals include a ban on assault-style weapons manufactured after July 1, a ban on untraceable “ghost guns” assembled at home, a five-day waiting period for gun purchases and several bills meant to encourage safe gun storage, particularly when children are present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few gun bills have picked up Republican votes, most notably a proposal to ban auto sears, small attachable devices that can produce automatic fire from semi-automatic handguns. Unregistered auto sears are already banned under federal law, but the Virginia bill aims to create a state-level ban that would give police more power to remove them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have criticized Democrats for blocking their proposals to toughen criminal penalties for people convicted of multiple gun crimes.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Minimum wage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A top Democratic priority for the session, legislation to raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026 has cleared both the House and Senate on strict party-line votes. The bills continue a process started by Democrats in 2020, when they began raising the minimum wage from the federal floor of $7.25 per hour to the current level of $12 per hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation is virtually doomed, however: While Youngkin hasn’t promised to veto the bill, he’s tiptoed right up to the line. At a small business-focused event in Richmond this January, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/23/the-market-is-working-youngkin-signals-opposition-to-minimum-wage-hike/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he told reporters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there was no need for the General Assembly to send him a bill “because the market is handling it. And they should allow small businesses to handle this.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Behavioral health reforms</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a state report found severe overcrowding and understaffing at Virginia’s nine state-run mental health hospitals, both Democrats and Republicans have backed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/14/bills-to-ease-strain-on-state-mental-hospitals-advance-without-bed-of-last-resort-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals that aim to ease the strain on the facilities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Bills that try to reduce “inappropriate” admissions of patients with conditions like autism or dementia, align nursing schedules with industry standards and step up investigations of abuse and neglect allegations have gotten unanimous support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers have stopped short of recommendations to reform Virginia’s “bed of last resort” law, which requires state hospitals to accept any patient under an involuntary commitment order if a bed can’t be found for them in a private facility. A December report found the law was contributing to dangerous numbers of patients in state wards. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Constitutional amendments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats came into the session with several big ideas for constitutional amendments on abortion, same-sex marriage and voting rights, but decided to push them off until next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those amendments would scrap Virginia’s longstanding policy of stripping voting rights for life after a felony conviction unless a governor restores them, create a state-level right to abortion and ensure same-sex marriage remains legal in Virginia no matter what future rulings come out of the U.S. Supreme Court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because those amendments need to be approved by the General Assembly in both 2025 and 2026 before going to voters for a final decision, passing the amendments this year wouldn’t have made the process any faster. Waiting a year could also bring strategic advantages for Democrats, giving them more time to reassess the political environment after the 2024 presidential race and build momentum heading into Virginia’s 2025 elections.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Weed</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers have approved legislation to allow retail marijuana sales for recreational use, which remains a major unfinished piece of Democratic efforts to decriminalize and regulate weed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are still working out the details of how a state-sanctioned retail market would work, but they don’t appear to be having much luck yet convincing Youngkin to allow legal weed stores on his watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, a recreational marijuana bill could still land on Youngkin’s desk, forcing him to veto it or give in as part of a broader legislative deal with Democratic leaders.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With abortion access in Virginia protected due to last year’s election results, Democrats have passed several bills meant to protect abortion providers and women seeking abortions in Virginia from being targeted by authorities in other states with abortion bans.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;‘A slap in the face’: Va. House GOP forced to reject own member’s anti-abortion bill&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/a-slap-in-the-face-va-house-gop-forced-to-reject-own-members-anti-abortion-bill/embed/#?secret=xLPf5S7FfK#?secret=3rNQQMmxu7" data-secret="3rNQQMmxu7" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB377&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prohibit anyone from being extradited to another state for abortion offenses that are not a crime in Virginia. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB78" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would prohibit law enforcement from getting search warrants for menstrual data stored in period-tracking apps, a preemptive safeguard abortion rights advocates say would prevent private health information from being seized for abortion-related prosecutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals creating a state-level right to contraception — another measure advocates have pitched as a way to prevent further erosion of reproductive rights — have also passed both chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have defeated several GOP-sponsored bills to ban or restrict abortion. One of those bills created </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/12/a-slap-in-the-face-va-house-gop-forced-to-reject-own-members-anti-abortion-bill/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high drama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the House when Democrats forced Republicans to take an up or down vote on whether all public funding for abortion should be banned with no exceptions for rape, incest, severe fetal abnormalities and when the life of the mother is at risk. After trying to avoid the vote altogether, nearly all Republicans ended up voting against the bill that came from their side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to continue to push this issue out there until they all capitulate and start backing women’s reproductive health care,” House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said of his move to bring the anti-abortion bill to the floor for a recorded vote. “Because they’ll continue to lose elections on this issue.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Same-sex marriage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Constitution still has an antiquated ban on same-sex marriage voters approved in 2006, but Democrats have been trying for years to overcome GOP opposition and give voters a chance to formally approve marriage equality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are waiting until next year to begin the process of formally scrapping the ban, but they’ll also probably need to retain control of the House in the 2025 elections and pass the amendment again in 2026 before it can go to voters in November of 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Democrats are pushing forward a mostly symbolic </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB174" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating that marriage licenses must be issued regardless of the gender, sex or race of the two people involved. That legislation has picked up a few Republican votes in the process, but it’s unclear how Youngkin will handle it.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Local taxes for modernizing schools</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers backed a bill that would let local governments increase their sales tax by 1% to pay for school construction projects as long as voters OK the increase in a referendum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the last two years of split control of the General Assembly, the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> died twice in the House after Republicans balked at the idea of raising taxes. But this year, the proposals have gotten strong bipartisan support, passing the Senate on a 27-13 vote and the House on a 69-28 vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, local governments have control over adjustments to their property tax rates but aren’t allowed to change the sales tax rate without explicit permission from the General Assembly. Under current law, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/24/virginia-explained-why-can-just-nine-localities-impose-a-sales-tax-for-school-capital-projects/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only nine localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can impose a 1% sales tax to fund school construction and renovation projects. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data centers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers introduced roughly a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/as-data-centers-continue-spreading-across-virginia-state-lawmakers-propose-new-development-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dozen bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to address the ongoing proliferation of data centers in Virginia. But only one has made it through crossover, with the others headed to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted in December</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to conduct a study of data centers in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s have JLARC have a look at it and move forward on data center and environment issues created by them in a uniform fashion and come up with really good public policy,” said Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, during discussion of one proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lone bill to make it out of its chamber, from Del. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, initially would have required local governments to conduct site assessments ahead of approving a project but was amended to say they can do the assessments if they want. It could face trouble in the Senate, which sent a similar version to JLARC for study.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Paid family and medical leave</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A proposal to set up a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/29/virginia-democrats-again-push-for-paid-family-and-medical-leave/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state-run, universal paid family and medical leave program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> modeled on the state’s unemployment insurance program passed the Senate but never made it out of the House Appropriations Committee. Uniform Republican opposition to the idea also indicates that even if the legislation makes it through the Democratic-controlled legislature, it’s unlikely to gain Youngkin’s favor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposal, both employers and employees would contribute small amounts to a state insurance fund that would then pay out 80% of a worker’s wages for up to 12 weeks annually if the worker had to take time off for the birth of a child, care for a family member or a serious health condition. Twelve states and Washington, D.C. have instituted similar programs to date. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Rent stabilization</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third time was not the charm for Suffolk Democratic Del. Nadarius Clark&#8217;s proposed measure to stabilize rent increases, which </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/11/4-takeaways-on-housing-in-light-of-thursdays-inflation-report/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surged statewide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the pandemic and are still a big concern for some Virginia residents and advocates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clark&#8217;s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB721" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 721</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have given localities the option to create anti-rent gouging ordinances and the power to enforce them, required that landlords give tenants at least two months&#8217; notice before hiking rent, and capped annual rent increases between 7% and 15%. Lawmakers in the House Courts of Justice Committee voted to continue the measure until 2025. Clark had put forward similar legislation in the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB596" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1532" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative sessions, both of which failed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took almost two years for the General Assembly to fill two vacancies on the State Corporation Commission, the arm of state government that regulates utilities, insurance, banking and business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A political standoff in the formerly divided legislature ended this session after Democrats took control of both chambers and appointed Kelsey Bagot, an attorney with NextEra Energy and former adviser to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member, and Sam Towell, an attorney for Smithfield Foods and former lawyer with the Office of the Attorney General. The appointments mean retired judges will no longer need to be recalled to maintain a quorum.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statewide prohibitions on outdoor burning near woods or dry grass before 4 p.m. will go into effect Feb. 15 and run through April 30, as Virginia’s spring fire season begins. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title10.1/chapter11/section10.1-1142/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forbids open-air fires — such as campfires or fires to burn debris — within 300 feet of “any woodland, brushland, or field containing dry grass or other inflammable material,” except between 4 p.m. and midnight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://dof.virginia.gov/wildland-prescribed-fire/fire-laws/4-pm-burning-law/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">guidelines posted by the Virginia Department of Forestry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the restrictions don’t apply to charcoal or gas-fired barbecue grills, although they do apply to open-air charcoal grills like those found in public parks. Additionally, the department notes, “an open-air fire MAY be acceptable if it meets the following criteria: it is completely contained within a ring of rocks, cinderblocks, metal ring, or a similar device and is covered by a ¼ inch or smaller metal screen.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the fire meets those criteria, it must be watched at all times, a 20-foot area around it must be cleared and the fire-watcher must have access to water, a rake and a shovel. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also exempt from the law: commercial vineyard and orchard owners, who since 2017 have been allowed to set fires </span><a href="https://dof.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/VAs-4PM-Burning-Law-Amended-for-Orchards-and-Vineyard-Growers_pub.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically to prevent frost damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their vines and trees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violators can be charged with a Class 3 misdemeanor and can face a fine of up to $500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/22/all-virginia-wildfires-except-matts-creek-contained-say-officials/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unusually active 2023 fall fire season</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saw the burning of thousands of acres in blazes such as the Quaker Run Fire in Madison County, the Matt’s Creek Fire in Bedford County, the Rocklick Fire in Buchanan County, the Tuggles Gap Fire in Patrick County and the Rachel’s Chapel Fire in Dickenson County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last fall, Virginia experienced extreme fire activity that provided a stark reminder of the importance of safe burning practices,” said Virginia Department of Forestry Fire and Emergency Response Chief John Miller in a statement. “Simple safety measures are easy to follow and significantly reduce the likelihood of an escaped fire, the number one cause of wildfires.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agency data have found more than 60% of the state’s roughly 700 annual wildfires occur in the spring, encouraged by dead leaves and grass, rising temperatures and windy weather. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s General Assembly passed the earliest version of the spring 4 p.m. burn ban in 1940, which focused on the burning of brush near woodlands. At that time, the prohibition was in place from March 1 to May 15 every year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1945, State Forester George Dean told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that spring season fires resulting from brush burning had sharply decreased since passage of the law. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three former and current female employees of the Virginia Department of Corrections are pursuing a class-action lawsuit against the agency, saying its policies on body scanners discriminate against women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inability of the state’s body-scanner technology to distinguish between contraband like drugs and menstrual products such as tampons, menstrual cups and intrauterine devices has led to multiple women being strip searched and in some cases terminated for using menstrual products, allege Mallory Patterson, Emily Comer and Carla McDowney. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one should have their job threatened, be subjected to a strip search, or have their employment terminated simply because they are menstruating, using a feminine hygiene product, or using a contraceptive device at work,” states the women’s lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia this November. “Such conduct is sex discrimination in violation of federal law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patterson and Comer, two former employees of VADOC, and McDowney, a correctional officer in training, are suing the agency and Director Chadwick Dotson over treatment they say they experienced, as well as seeking the court’s approval to open a class-action case. Dotson took over the Virginia Department of Corrections’ top post in September 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly 46% of the agency’s 13,000 employees are female, the suit notes. The department also employs about 1,000 more people through staffing companies. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2022, a federal jury found </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/09/20/virginia-prison-agency-discriminated-against-female-employee-in-tampon-case-jury-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VADOC had discriminated against dental hygienist Joyce Flores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it fired her after a body scanner at Augusta Correctional Center detected a tampon she was wearing and officials suspected she was trying to bring contraband into the prison. U.S. District Judge Elizabeth K. Dillon later awarded Flores, who was also strip searched, around $287,000 in damages, costs and attorney’s fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search “was one of the worst things I ever had to do in my life,” Flores told the Mercury this January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I couldn’t believe I was going through this process,” she said. “And I couldn’t believe in a state facility that it would be permitted to have things like this go on.”  </span></p>
<p>Patterson, Comer and McDowney are being represented by Paul Falabella of Butler Curwood, PLC, which also represented Flores.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to several questions about the most recent suit and whether VADOC had changed its policy on body scanners after the Flores ruling, agency spokesperson Kyle Gibson said only that “VADOC does not routinely comment on active or pending litigation.” After receiving an extension from the courts, the agency has until Feb. 24 to file a response to the suit. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Employees describe strip searches and terminations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the women bringing the lawsuit allege that after body scanners detected their menstrual products, prison officials gave them the choice of being strip searched or being terminated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the suit, Patterson, who was employed through a contractor as a therapeutic counselor at Indian Creek Correctional Center in Chesapeake, was flagged as suspicious after going through a body scanner on Nov. 10, 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she told an investigator she was wearing a menstrual cup, the lawsuit says the investigator told her she had two options: “Comply with a strip search or leave and be separated from employment, pending potential criminal charges.” The suit says she agreed to the search because she felt it was the only way “to keep her job, prove her innocence, and avoid criminal charges.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she wept while signing the strip search consent form, the suit says a corrections official told her, “This happens to some staff every year and each one of them feels just like you do right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the court filing, three officers then took Patterson “into the bathroom and proceeded to instruct her to take every piece of clothing off until she was standing naked on the dirty bathroom floor. Patterson was then instructed to remove and show her menstrual cup to the officers, which she did. Patterson was crying the entire time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next month, she resigned because she “felt she could not continue to work in the environment at” Indian Creek Correctional. </span></p>

		<p style="font-size:13px"><b>– A VADOC corrections officer, according to a recent lawsuit</b></p>
	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McDowney, who began working as a correctional officer in training at Haynesville Correctional Center in Richmond County in August 2023, says in the lawsuit that she was wearing a tampon and sanitary pad when she was stopped at the facility’s body scanner on Oct. 27, 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the warden asked if McDowney consented to a strip search, “McDowney asked ‘and if I don’t?’ The Warden replied then ‘you don’t have a job,’” the suit says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After she agreed to the search, McDowney was taken into a bathroom, where VADOC officials “searched each clothing item as she removed them until she was standing barefoot and completely naked on the dirty bathroom floor,” the court filing says. “She was then instructed to remove her tampon and sanitary pad, which she did.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After re-dressing, the suit says that McDowney asked the warden, “‘If I go through this machine again next month and I am on my period again, am I going to have to go through something like this again?’ The Warden shrugged his shoulders and made a facial expression that indicated ‘maybe.’”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comer was employed through a staffing agency as a licensed practical nurse at State Farm Correctional Center in Goochland between April 2020 and April 2022. On April 4, 2022, the lawsuit says, she was stopped at the body scanner. Although she was not menstruating, she had an IUD, a device implanted in the uterus that prevents conception. On April 7, she was informed that the warden had decided she wasn’t allowed back into the facility “due to suspicious body scans.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flores told the Mercury that before her own strip search in December 2019, “I had heard that there were a couple of women that were dismissed and that one of them had been accused of bringing in contraband in her vagina. But I didn’t know the specifics. I had heard from other women that if you are on your period, just be careful coming in.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some women, she said, told her “that in order to get through the day, they’d push their limits with the feminine products so they wouldn’t have to change them while they were there.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Agency policy</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rather than isolated incidents, both Flores’ lawsuit and the action brought by Patterson, McDowney and Comer contend their searches were the product of agency policy that is inherently discriminatory toward women because it results in strip searches or firings that are not imposed on men, who do not menstruate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both federal Judge Thomas Cullen and a jury agreed with that claim in Flores’ suit, with Cullen </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-prison-staffer-says-she-was-fired-on-suspicion-of-smuggling-after-body-scan-detected-tampon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling in February 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “but for Flores’s menstruation and use of a tampon — conditions inextricable from her sex and her child-bearing capacity — she would not have been discharged.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent lawsuit says the Virginia Department of Corrections’ standard operating procedures require all people entering a correctional facility, including employees, to go through the body scanner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While VADOC does not make its </span><a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/general-public/operating-procedures/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">operating procedures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for searches of inmates and other persons publicly available on its website, a copy of the procedures filed in the Flores case states that “when an unknown object is detected on an employee, intern, volunteer, or official visitor, the Facility Unit Head or Administrative Duty Officer may authorize a strip search.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it declares that “all facility employees are subject to search as a condition of employment,” and “employee refusal to submit to a search … is justification for barring the individual from the facility and possible termination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The document containing those procedures was filed with the court in February 2022 but may have been updated since then. However, the Department of Corrections said it was unable to fulfill a Freedom of Information Act request for a copy of “t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he agency&#8217;s SOPs for screenings and searches of persons” within five working days and would require an additional seven. An agency spokesperson also did not provide an answer to a question about whether the department had changed its operating procedures after the Flores case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VADOC has previously argued the scanners are necessary to crack down on contraband flowing into prisons. Some of the illegal material smuggled into facilities comes from employees: During the COVID-19 pandemic, with all visitation halted, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/05/24/drugs-continued-to-flow-into-virginia-prisons-amid-pandemic-raising-concerns-about-corrupt-staff/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">positive drug tests for inmates rose</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and drug seizures and overdoses fell only slightly. On Jan. 3, the agency announced </span><a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/news-press-releases/2024/vadoc-finds-contraband-on-female-contractor-after-body-scan-at-indian-creek-correctional-center/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a staffer had attempted to smuggle tobacco</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Indian Creek Correctional Center by concealing it in her groin area. In October, </span><a href="https://vadoc.virginia.gov/news-press-releases/2023/vadoc-employee-arrested-after-intelligence-leads-to-contraband-search/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an employee at Sussex I State Prison was arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a search of their vehicle found nine cell phones and other cell phone equipment, five packages of tobacco and tobacco wrapping papers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flores said during her own strip search, officials showed “absolutely no sympathy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In their mind, they knew that I had something in my body that resembled more to them to be like contraband than to be like a tampon,” she said. “They were very matter of fact. They were cold.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VADOC officials have repeatedly said their scanners are unable to tell the difference between menstrual products and contraband. Internal agency memos have said that the state’s body scanner technology “is not perfect and it is not able to distinguish tampons from contraband” and “body scanners cannot differentiate between tampons/menstrual cups or other contraband in a body cavity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/blog-va/prison-officials-say-theyre-still-blocking-women-wearing-tampons-from-full-visitation-privileges-over-contraband-concerns/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an agency employee told the General Assembly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “We can’t tell what’s in someone as they go through a body scanner. We just can’t tell if it’s drugs or a tampon. It just shows if there’s something wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement followed public outcry over an earlier policy that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-prison-bans-female-visitors-from-wearing-tampons/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned women from wearing tampons while visiting prisons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After the furor, then-Virginia Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Brian Moran suspended the policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flores said her time with the agency frequently “felt like I was experiencing remnants of sexism.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was acutely aware that other women were having trouble feeling comfortable while they were menstruating,” she said. After her own search and termination, she said she realized “that there were likely other women who had gone through what I had been put through.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I knew what happened to me could never happen to a man biologically,” she said.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s always fun to see what the most popular baby names will be in Virginia,” said Seth Austin, state registrar and director of the Virginia Department of Health’s Office of Vital Records </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/2024-news-releases/virginia-department-of-healths-office-of-vital-records-announces-top-baby-names-of-2023-other-interesting-virginia-birth-data/?utm_campaign=20240206_&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in a release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday. “The inspiration for a name can come from so many different places, and no matter the inspiration, these new babies’ names will be central to their identity as they grow up and do great things in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides repeats Charlotte and Liam, many of this year’s top baby names also made last year’s list. Emma, Olivia, Ava, Sophia, Amelia, Evelyn, Elizabeth, Eleanor, Harper and Abigail proved perennial favorites for girls, as did Noah, James, Oliver, William, Lucas, Henry, Theodore, Benjamin, Levi, Elijah and John for boys. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, state data showed August was the busiest month of the year for births, but July 7 saw more infants ushered into the commonwealth — 332, to be exact — than any other day in the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you believe </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday%27s_Child" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the old “Monday’s Child” poem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> linking character to the day of the week a baby is born, Virginia has a lot of little ones right now who are “loving and giving,” with 14,231 babies born on a Friday in 2023. On the flipside, only 8,768 were born on a Sunday, meaning the state’s ranks of babies who are “bonny and blithe, good and gay” may be depleted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a final tally of births isn’t yet available for last year, the Office of Vital Records estimates the number will be similar to the 95,583 recorded in 2022. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the museum did get: dozens of calls from supporters asking why the institution — Virginia’s oldest museum, now operated as a private nonprofit — had not cashed the checks they had mailed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in late January, “magically three cases of mail showed up postmarked in October and November,” said president and CEO Jamie Bosket. “That bundle of mail that came represented about $300,000 in memberships. … We still expect that we have maybe as much as $100,000 in missing donations.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bosket wasn’t alone in his experience. During a Friday roundtable at the museum convened by U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, residents and representatives of businesses and groups in the Richmond area reported a spike in problems with mail delivery throughout the fall that they said have yet to be resolved or explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Nolan, a resident of Richmond’s Bellevue neighborhood, said while mail delivery “has never been good,” beginning this September, critical pieces of correspondence ranging from his electoral ballot to utility bills to government missives failed to show up at his house. Complaints got him nowhere, he said. One postal worker told him to contact U.S. Postmaster Louis DeJoy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Lynn, the owner of a commercial kitchen equipment company Victor Products, said his mail also regularly fails to show up at his business — a problem that culminated this December in a large check from the University of Virginia being stolen and deposited by a thief. The check was only recovered because a cautious bank employee called Lynn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor Brewer, an employee of developer Stylecraft Homes who manages homeowners associations, said one of the company’s properties “went six months without daily mail service.” And Nancye Hunter, an employee at a machine shop in the city’s Southside, said this June, “we had nine business days where we did not receive a single parcel of mail at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/03/08/the-checks-in-the-mail-but-that-doesnt-mean-it-will-arrive-this-week-or-this-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">isn’t a new problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” she said. “This is a problem that’s been allowed to snowball. And it’s gotten exponentially worse.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Virginia’s congressional delegation have sent multiple letters to the U.S. Postal Service raising concerns about mail delivery issues in not only the Richmond area but also other parts of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am concerned that Virginia communities as far-flung as Smyth County in Southwest Virginia, the Richmond area (nearly 300 miles away from Chilhowie by highway), and Arlington, across the river from Washington, D.C., are all experiencing missing bills, medications, tax documents, and days/weeks without mail,” Kaine wrote in a May 2023 letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Richmond’s issues have proved some of the most persistent. In December, Kaine and U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, asked USPS Virginia District Manager Gerald Roane to hold a town hall about mail delivery issues and postal thefts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, the problems again made headlines when the Richmond VA Medical Center reported that delivery delays had left </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/hundreds-of-virginia-veterans-cancer-test-samples-deemed-unusable-due-to-postal-delays/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundreds of testing samples used to screen veterans for colon cancer unusable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be clear; this is unacceptable. These issues with postal delays have caused unnecessary stress and harm for our constituents and suggest to us that the issues in the region are worse than we thought,” </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-leads-bipartisan-colleagues-to-press-usps-on-alarming-richmond-area-mail-delays" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven bipartisan members of Virginia’s congressional delegation wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to DeJoy and Roane after the VA issue surfaced. “We are unsatisfied with the level of urgency and responsiveness the agency has demonstrated with the issues we have raised previously, and this must change with this new revelation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Jan. 17, Roane declined the request to hold a town hall, saying such gatherings “complicate” efforts to monitor and ensure customer service, “rarely provide any meaningful insights to improve operations, and raise questions about basic fairness.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond’s regional mail processing center in Sandston “did experience operational complications during its setup and roll-out,” he conceded. However, he said, “these have been addressed and the facility is now positioned to provide the state-of-the-art mail and package processing for which it was designed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">USPS officials also </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/richmond-commonwealths-attorneys-office-cancels-postal-town-hall-meeting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backed out of a December town hall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> organized by Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Colette McEachin to discuss mail delivery issues, mail fraud and mail theft. And they declined a request by Kaine to tour the Sandston facility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Postal Service in Richmond is broken,” McEachin said Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine described the situation as “at a crisis level in Richmond since the fall.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve tried to do town hall meetings with the post office,” he continued. “They’ve said no. We’ve tried to tour the distribution center. They’ve said no.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to a request for comment, a USPS spokesperson said that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">while we were unable to provide a tour last week, we want all our stakeholders to know under Delivering For America, the Postal Service’s 10-year plan, we are maintaining universal six-day mail delivery and expanded seven-day package delivery, stabilizing our workforce, and spurring innovation to meet the needs of our modern customers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Postal Service said customers with questions about mail delivery can contact their local post office, call the Virginia District Consumer Affairs Office at 804-775-6313, or send a message on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, at @USPSHelp. The destination address or tracking number can help expedite any investigation.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration unveiled a new website that will allow the public to track the status of government permits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://permits.virginia.gov/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Permit Transparency website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to bring “greater visibility to the regulatory and permitting processes,” said Youngkin in a statement on the release Monday. </span></p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-launches-platform-to-make-environmental-permit-info-public/</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piloted by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality as the Permitting Enhancement and Evaluation Platform — aptly abbreviated PEEP — the site currently includes records of permits issued by DEQ, the Virginia Department of Energy and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Permit records from the Virginia Department of Health, Department of Transportation and Department of Conservation and Recreation are scheduled to come online this summer.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information is available on the status of each step the permit must undergo before approval, the target and actual timelines for review and the body that oversees each step. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tracking system does not include any of the actual documents involved in permitting, although it lets the public more easily identify which documents might be available at a state agency. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s launch of the Virginia Permit Transparency website is just the first step to attracting top-quality business and job opportunities to Virginia,&#8221; said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez. &#8220;The website was built and is configured with future expansions in mind beyond the option to ask permit reviewers follow up questions.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s office said the Office of Regulatory Management is leading the development of the Virginia Permitting Transparency site. That office was created by an executive order from Youngkin in June 2022 with the goal of cutting regulatory requirements by 25%, streamlining the regulatory process and increasing transparency about the regulatory process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin chose Andrew Wheeler, the former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, to lead the office after Senate Democrats </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/senate-democrats-block-wheeler-appointment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocked his appointment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the state’s secretary of natural and historic resources during the 2022 legislative session. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats are again backing a proposal to create a universal paid family and medical leave program that would be run through the Virginia Employment Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation carried by </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb373" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB737" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Briana Sewell, D-Prince William</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would adopt the general model used for unemployment insurance to cover the costs of up to 12 weeks of leave in a year for the birth of a child, care for a family member or a serious health condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the federal Family and Medical Leave Act requires employers with 50 or more workers to provide up to 12 weeks of leave for similar reasons — known as qualifying events — it does not require that employees be paid during that time. Boysko and Sewell’s proposal would guarantee that workers who meet the criteria for the benefit would receive 80% of their wages during leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For far too long people have been forced to make the incredibly difficult decision of caring for someone they love or skipping a paycheck,” said Sewell during a press conference on the proposal Monday. “And women in particular are hard hit by this challenge because we also often are the de facto caregivers for our families and for our loved ones.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program would be funded by contributions from both employers and employees. Boysko and Sewell estimate the cost would equal roughly 0.5% of a worker’s paycheck; for a worker earning $50,000 annually, Sewell said earlier this month that would equate to $4.57 per week, or about $238 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presenting the bill in committee, Boysko said Virginia workers shouldn&#8217;t have to face the &#8220;cruel choice&#8221; between staying gainfully employed and taking time away for pressing family priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t have to be this way. And it&#8217;s not like this in the rest of the world,&#8221; Boysko said. &#8220;Virginia can be a family-friendly place for workers.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the legislation passes, the commonwealth would join 12 other states, including Maryland and Delaware, and the District of Columbia in providing paid family and medical leave. But while Democrats have the numbers to push the proposal through both the House of Delegates and the Senate, they will need to gain the approval of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to get it across the finish line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/08/mid-session-update-whats-still-alive-and-whats-dead-or-on-the-way-there/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> succeeded in killing the legislation in the House, and they have unanimously opposed it at the committee level this year. Several influential business groups have also spoken out against it, saying it would interfere with employers’ ability to make their own decisions about what’s doable for their workplace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s our stance that employers should be able to craft benefit packages appropriate to their industry,&#8221; said Travis Smiley, a lobbyist for the grocery store-focused Virginia Food Industry Association. Grocery stores usually see high employee turnover, Smiley said, which brings &#8220;unique challenges.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few business groups such as the Virginia Small Business Council, however, have said a state insurance pool would help smaller businesses with fewer resources offer workers a valuable benefit that could improve retention and drive down employee turnover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is leveling the playing field, giving small businesses an opportunity to compete with the huge corporations,” said Shirley Modlin, the owner of a small manufacturing company in Powhatan and a member of Small Business Majority&#8217;s Virginia Small Business Council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has so far been silent on the proposal. Asked about his stance, spokesman Christian Martinez said only that the governor would review any legislation that comes to his desk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have not spoken in opposition,” said Sewell. “They have not spoken in support.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both she and Boysko are pitching the plan as aligned with priorities voiced by the governor in his December </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/12/20/youngkin-budget-calls-for-income-tax-cuts-sales-tax-increases/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the need to “empower working parents” and to address child care shortfalls that have caused women, in particular, to drop out of the workforce.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The governor has talked about his desire to unleash opportunity here in the commonwealth of Virginia,” said Sewell. “I think it’s time that he unleash opportunity for workers who need to care for their families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both bills will now be reviewed by the chambers’ money committees.</span></p>

Jennifer Boysko again presented legislation to require employers to list a wage or salary range in all job postings and prohibit them from asking prospective employees for a salary history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the eighth time I have introduced this legislation,” Boysko told the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee before vowing to keep reintroducing the measure until it reaches the governor’s desk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko has pitched </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB370" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 370</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a way to help remedy gender pay gaps by deterring employers from relying on prior salaries to craft future compensation. The idea is that because women in Virginia as a group still make less than men, basing salary offers on past wages could perpetuate those disparities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Salary history is often a reflection of past discrimination,” Emily Yen, a lobbyist for the Virginia Education Association, told lawmakers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last April, </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/news-release/womensearnings_virginia.htm#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20Virginia%20women%20who,of%20Labor%20Statistics%20reported%20today." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that in Virginia, the median usual weekly earnings of women who worked full-time were 80% of what their male counterparts received. Full-time workers were considered people who usually worked 35 or more hours per week at their sole or principal job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s labor advocates have also argued requiring employers to disclose wage or salary ranges provides needed transparency that can dampen inequalities by putting male and female applicants on more equal footing in compensation negotiations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When employers negotiate without giving salary range information to job applicants, applicants are more likely to rely on their past pay as a negotiation reference point, which perpetuates existing pay gaps,” </span><a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NWLC-Pay-Range-Transparency-Factsheet_2023-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote the National Women’s Law Center in a brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boysko’s legislation would not prohibit prospective employees from “voluntarily disclosing wage or salary history, including for the purpose of negotiating wages or salary after an initial offer of employment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers who violated the new rules would be subject to civil penalties of between $1,000 and $4,000, depending on their history of violations, as well as potential damages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate committee passed Boysko’s legislation on a 9-6 party-line vote after concerns from Republicans about whether the bill offered employers a right to appeal any violation determinations by the state Commissioner of Labor and Industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re having a penalty, you should be able to appeal it to a court,” said Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was amended in committee to outline an appeals process. It now heads to the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee for review. </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation to raise the state minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2026 is moving briskly through the Virginia General Assembly as Democrats take advantage of their narrow majorities in both chambers to complete an effort they began in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a simple bill,” said Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, who chairs the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee. “It just reenacts what we did before.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carried by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, as </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Jeion Ward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Hampton, as </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the legislation is a signature priority of Democrats this session and would bring the wage to $13.50 in 2025 and $15 in 2026. The measure cleared the Senate and House committees on labor and commerce this week on party-line votes and is headed to the chamber’s money committees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while Democrats have the numbers to pass the increases out of the General Assembly, they fall short of what they would need to override a possible veto from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Asked about the governor’s stance on the proposals, spokesperson Christian Martinez said only that Youngkin “will review any legislation that comes to his desk.” </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5mNezXUauV"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-12/">Virginia lawmakers vote to raise the minimum wage to $12 over three years</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia lawmakers vote to raise the minimum wage to $12 over three years&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-12/embed/#?secret=csOOp0AExU#?secret=5mNezXUauV" data-secret="5mNezXUauV" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, when the party held more decisive control of the legislature and was backed by Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, Democrats pushed through bills </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-12/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising the state minimum wage incrementally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the $7.25 federal floor to $12 by 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But because the chambers disagreed on how high the wage should go — House Democrats wanted $15, while the Senate was in favor of $11.50 and resulting smaller increases that varied regionally — the final law delayed further hikes until 2024, when the General Assembly would again be required to endorse them. It also asked for a study on whether regionally set minimum wages could be workable.   </span></p>
<p><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/SD6/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wasn’t completed until December 2023, and during debate in the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee Monday, many senators seemed unaware of its publication. Its findings indicated that a half-million Virginians were making $12 or less in 2021, with $1 million making $15 or less. Minimum wage workers were “younger, more likely to be female, less educated, and more likely to belong to a racial and ethnic minority than the total labor force.” They were most prevalent in Southwest Virginia and least prevalent in Northern Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost of living also varied widely: The study found that at the highest end of the spectrum, a family in Alexandria needed to earn $22.42 per hour to afford basic necessities, while at the lowest end, a Tazewell family needed $14.55 per hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to whether regional variation in a minimum wage might offer a solution, the report was uncertain. “There is not conclusive evidence demonstrating the clear advantage or disadvantage of a regional minimum wage over a statewide minimum wage,” it found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans expressed unease over the varied impacts the wage hikes could have on less affluent parts of the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We ought to look at the impact of this legislation on other areas of the state first,” said Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, who described the bill as “an example of shooting first and asking questions later.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, however, argued that cost of living hikes due to inflation have increased the urgency of the wage bumps. Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, noted that according to the </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, $12 in July 2020 was equal to $14.21 in December 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re just actually keeping up with inflation barely with this change,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the House Labor and Commerce Committee, Republicans and business groups said Thursday that increasing the minimum wage would lead to problems with wage compression and further drive up costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you continue to ratchet up the cost of labor, you’re just going to continue to ratchet up the cost of products,” said Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick. “You’re just going to create more struggle.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Del. Tony Wilt, R-Harrisonburg, said, “It appears that as the wage goes up, the cost of living is going to go up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do you ever see us getting ahead where folks are saying, ‘I make enough money, I’m good’?” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats countered that they had heard many of the same fears in response to the 2020 law beginning the wage increases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those of us who were here when [Ward] led the last effort to do this remember all the hand-wringing and the predictions that people were going to lose their jobs and the economy was going to tank and businesses were going to shutter,” said Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax. “Well, I’ve sat through several speeches that our governor has given the last several months touting, thankfully, historic low unemployment in Virginia. Wages are up, incomes are up, more Virginians are working than ever before. Those predictions of doom and gloom just have not happened.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling was a victory for local news outlets who had asked for copies of the report and a defeat for school officials who had been trying to keep it secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tuesday order from Judge W. Reilly Marchant requires the school division to make the report public by 1 p.m. Wednesday but permits redactions to “several minimal parts of the report that do constitute legal advice.” The ruling says a confidential account of the allowed redactions will be filed with the court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond School Board had argued that because the third-party report was written by a law firm, Sands Anderson, it was subject to attorney-client privilege and could be kept confidential under the state’s Freedom of Information Act. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8KSh64o4si"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/12/judge-orders-richmond-school-board-to-let-him-review-confidential-report-on-graduation-shooting/">Judge orders Richmond School Board to let him review &#8216;confidential&#8217; report on graduation shooting</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Judge orders Richmond School Board to let him review &#8216;confidential&#8217; report on graduation shooting&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/12/judge-orders-richmond-school-board-to-let-him-review-confidential-report-on-graduation-shooting/embed/#?secret=DLMacDfN88#?secret=8KSh64o4si" data-secret="8KSh64o4si" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marchant disagreed, writing that the report, “taken as a whole, was not created for the primary purpose of providing legal advice, and the express terms of the resolution, upon which the report is based, are very clear in that regard.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney-client privilege, he continued, “does not protect documents and other communications simply because they result from an attorney-client relationship. … The privilege protects only those disclosures necessary to obtain informed legal advice which might not have been made absent the privilege.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marchant’s ruling is in line with the argument put forward by the three petitioners who sought release of the report in Richmond Circuit Court: the Richmond Times-Dispatch, news station WTVR and transparency activist Josh Stanfield. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a hearing last week, attorneys for the news outlets repeatedly pointed to the resolution passed by the School Board on Aug. 14 to authorize a third-party investigation related to the shooting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That resolution called for the report to examine “graduation day operations from set up, to break down,” “the process and procedures for entrance of all students and guests,” “written statements” from school and division staff on “preparations for all graduations on June 6” and “the breakdown of our homebound process and procedures that directly impact grading.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homebound services are provided to students who cannot attend school in person for various reasons. Richmond police have said they believe the June 6 shooting outside the Huguenot High School graduation ceremony was related to an ongoing feud that involved Shawn Jackson, a student killed in the shooting who had been enrolled in Richmond Public Schools’ homebound program. Division policy prohibited homebound students from participating in school-sponsored activities such as the graduation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is clear that this was primarily a fact-finding mission,” said David Lacy, an attorney for the Times-Dispatch, during Friday’s hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marchant emphasized that the School Board had chosen not to include “legal or legality issues” in its Aug. 14 resolution and noted that Richmond Superintendent Jason Kamras had testified that he did not engage Sands Anderson to do more than what the resolution directed. Furthermore, he wrote, an outline of the work Sands Anderson agreed to perform “mirror[s] exactly the language of the 8/14/2023 resolution.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Clearly nothing within the four corners of the 8/14/2023 resolution sought legal advice,” wrote Marchant. “The resolution is very straightforward in what the School Board wanted from the investigation, and legal advice was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question of whether the report should be released has split the Richmond School Board, which voted 6-2 against making it public this November. The board was allowed to review the report in a closed session on Nov. 6, but members were not permitted to keep any copies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board member Jonathan Young told WTVR that he didn’t “have words to describe how damning a report this is. My jaw hit the floor. I knew it was going to be bad, but I didn’t know how bad.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other members voiced concern that releasing the report could open up the school division to litigation.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his ruling, Marchant concluded that “any potential consequences of publicly disclosing the report are not a basis to exempt the report from mandatory disclosure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A non-privileged document does not somehow become privileged simply because it includes information the owner would prefer not to disclose,” he wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Kamras said he and School Board Chair Stephanie Rizzi &#8220;</span>welcome the release of the report and we will have a full statement tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After nearly eight hours of testimony Friday, Richmond Judge W. Reilly Marchant said he would issue a written opinion in the case “no later” than next Thursday.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The closely watched Freedom of Information Act lawsuit playing out in Richmond is centered on the question of whether government bodies can keep investigative reports secret if they hire outside law firms to produce them. The state’s transparency laws include exemptions allowing public bodies to get confidential legal advice, but that exemption is limited to clearly defined legal matters and doesn’t automatically apply to every government action involving lawyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The June 6 shooting in Richmond, which occurred outside Huguenot High School’s graduation ceremony at the Altria Theater, left two dead, five wounded and at least a dozen others injured in the chaos that followed. In its aftermath, Superintendent Jason Kamras’ administration produced an internal report on the events of the day, but a majority of the Richmond School Board voted to commission an external report, with some members citing concerns about the internal document’s accuracy and completeness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond School Board hired law firm Sands Anderson to produce the report, which was revealed to members on Nov. 6 in a closed session. Board members were not permitted to keep copies of the report, but member Jonathan Young later </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-graduation-shooting-report-update-nov-10-2023?fbclid=IwAR0MhV_6oLoXP4TaMhjaWVAo_Q1AML-6pzdFnPj8BU6pdc4ItVKBCCTdxxg_aem_AWqa1pEgOfWL7ZjRNAsPsQ0fiQ4gkucn-grlTEHcB9-GH4-Yb-IY-jccRHv5di2RDGs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told news station WTVR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it was “damning.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the board </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/12/01/foia-friday-uva-and-richmond-public-schools-refuse-to-release-shooting-reports/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refused to release the report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing an exemption in Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act for “attorney-client privilege,” the Richmond Times-Dispatch, WTVR and transparency activist Josh Stanfield filed lawsuits to compel the division to make the document public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In court Friday, the petitioners argued that the report commissioned by the School Board was “a fact-finding mission” intended only to establish what had happened on and in the leadup to June 6 rather than a document focused on legal advice concerning issues such as division liability. Attorneys David Lacy and Brett Spain noted numerous board members had during public meetings emphasized a need for transparency and the board had rejected a proposal to include legal advice in the scope of the report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They wanted a complete and factually accurate report about what happened. And they wanted transparency and accountability,” said Spain. “If the intent of this was to do a privileged investigation … they wouldn’t have been talking about transparency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the primary purpose of the report was not for the board to obtain legal advice, the attorneys contended, it could not rightfully be withheld under the attorney-client privilege exemption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorneys and witnesses for the Richmond School Board made the case that because the investigation delved into sensitive topics like student records, personnel matters and potential legal liability, there was an assumption that the entire process would be kept confidential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pamela O’Berry, a Sands Anderson attorney who led the investigation, said her team’s interviews with Richmond Public Schools employees had to be kept confidential in order to convince them to participate in the investigation and “trust the process.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew that documents would not give us all of the information,” O’Berry said. “We knew that interviews would be key.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">O’Berry said she didn’t have subpoena power to compel participation by school employees, and division leadership didn’t authorize her to warn employees they could be disciplined for refusing to help with the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. Kamras said no, we don’t want people to feel intimidated,” O’Berry said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the School Board may not have clearly spelled out it was primarily concerned with legal issues, O’Berry said the fact that a young graduate and his father had died at a school-sponsored event was “a flashing red light” that would be obvious to any lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both O’Berry and Kamras testified that there was some closed-door discussion about creating an executive summary of the investigation&#8217;s findings that could be released to the public. No such summary was created, they said.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A day after being sworn in as Virginia’s first Black Speaker of the House, Del. Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, is already looking beyond the current legislative session that began Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Scott announced the creation of a new temporary committee that will meet beginning this May to address the lack of health care access in rural Virginia. Chaired by Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, with Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Spotsylvania, as vice chair, the committee will be tasked with coming up with at least five legislative recommendations by Nov. 15. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the first time in generations, life expectancy in the United States has decreased,” said Scott in a release announcing the committee’s formation. “This is acute in our rural communities where suicide, overdose deaths, and diabetes are on the rise. … It is critical that we address this matter with the urgency it deserves.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 12-person committee will be composed of seven Democrats and five Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amanda Pittman, a spokesperson for Scott, said the speaker is “very focused on bipartisanship this session.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is something that everyone can rally behind,” she said. “A large part of Virginia is rural, so if we’re going to work together, we have to remember those people too.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that between 2019 and 2021, life expectancy fell 2.4 years to 76.4 years, the lowest it had been since 1996. Life expectancy </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr031.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ticked up again to 77.5 years in 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the CDC has cautioned the increase “does not fully offset” the pandemic-era losses. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db417.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other CDC research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that between 1999 and 2019, death rates in rural areas remained persistently higher than those in urban areas, both overall and for each of the 10 leading causes of death. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policymakers have long recognized shortfalls in rural health care: Under former Gov. Doug Wilder, Virginia set up its State Office of Rural Health within the Virginia Department of Health in the early 1990s as part of <a href="https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/rural-monitor/sorh-anniversary" target="_blank">a broader federal push</a> to bolster health care in the less populated parts of the country. The office’s </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/76/2022/01/Virginia-Rural-Health-Plan_Book_POST_1-24-22_LR.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022-2026 Virginia Rural Health Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notes that many of the state’s rural areas are federally designated as “health professional shortage areas” for not only primary care, but also dental and mental health care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Access problems are especially notable in Lee County in far-Southwest Virginia, the plan found, and in Patrick County, where emergency personnel “reported routinely transporting patients two hours to North Carolina or Roanoke.” On the other side of the state, “communities on the Eastern Shore have a robust clinical system available but most specialty care is across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel, which spans 17.6 miles with an eighteen dollar toll each way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Thursday’s announcement, Willett said “the challenges rural folks face are unique.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They often must travel great distances to access adequate healthcare. Telehealth, which serves as an alternative to many and grew in accessibility for most during the COVID-19 pandemic, is still inaccessible in some areas due to a lack of high-speed broadband,” he said. “It is my hope that the select committee can make recommendations to address these issues in the next legislative session.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Mercury news reporters published over 1,021 stories and commentary writers put out 221 opinion pieces. Some of you read all of them. Others — including my parents, whom I would have hoped would be in the former category — were more choosy. As we embark on a fresh year of covering the weirdness and wonder of Virginia, here’s a glimpse at the stories that resonated with you most. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">1. Virginia Democrats triumph in statehouse elections, reducing Youngkin’s power</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest of the country may already be fixated on the 2024 presidential election, but Virginians were clearly more concerned with who they were sending to Richmond for the last two years of Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration. The 2023 General Assembly races were the most expensive in the state’s history, and they were nailbiters that saw Democrats eke out narrow victories in both the House and the Senate — sometimes by only double-digit votes. You wanted to read about it, many of you as soon as we posted this story around midnight on Election Night. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">2. Invasive plants have spread all over Virginia. Some groups say that needs to stop.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policymakers, take note: Virginians have </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feelings</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the English ivy, kudzu and autumn olive that they see creeping all over their backyards and neighborhoods. We see there’s already at least </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB47" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about invasive species on the General Assembly’s docket this January, and if our readership is anything to go by, there’s going to be a lot of testimony to hear. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37178" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_6955-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37178" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_6955-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_6955-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_6955-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_6955-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_6955-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_6955-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/IMG_6955-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A house in Dickenson County covered in kudzu.

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">3. Ahead of new age verification law, Pornhub blocks access in Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, a lawmaker who shall not be named asked one of our reporters if the Virginia Mercury was the publication that “just writes about bills and stuff.” The answer is yes. But in 2023, thanks to one of those bills — this one requiring porn sites to use age verification technology to confirm a viewer is 18 or over before allowing them access — we also wrote a reasonable amount about pornography policy. And you liked reading it, although maybe not as much as you liked reading about plants. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">4. Youngkin signs universal license recognition law at Richmond barber shop</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This law signed by the governor will affect a lot of people’s lives. It makes Virginia recognize many of the professional licenses issued by other states, including those for barbers, interior designers, home contractors, tattooists and professional wrestlers, all of whom will have an easier time working when they move to the Old Dominion. But also, we think readers wanted to see a picture of Glenn Youngkin getting a haircut with an expression not dissimilar to that on the face of a first grader facing the Olan Mills photographer for the first time. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34592" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Youngkin_Haircut-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34592" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Youngkin_Haircut-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Youngkin_Haircut-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Youngkin_Haircut-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Youngkin_Haircut-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Youngkin_Haircut-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Youngkin_Haircut-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Youngkin_Haircut-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dot Reid gives Gov.

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">5. Report: As Northern Virginia prospers, some neighborhood conditions worsen</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, people really are interested in studies by academics. Such was the case with this story, which recounted the results of Virginia Commonwealth University research that found despite all of Northern Virginia’s wealth, some neighborhoods are getting left far behind.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">6. Many pornography websites aren’t complying with new Va. age verification law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t have to rehash this one. Reporter Meghan McIntyre found that most pornography websites weren’t complying with the new state law on age verification. One Reddit user speculated that we googled “top porn sites” to begin investigating compliance, and that user was pretty much correct. The things you do for journalism. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">7. Marijuana will be legal in Virginia on July 1. Here’s what is and isn’t permitted under the new law.</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You guys love this story. It was written by the great Ned Oliver in 2021, and usually it’s higher on the most read list. We can only assume that more people are starting to understand what Virginia’s pot laws are and no longer need such a resource. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an aside: It’s very annoying when you think you’ve written a real slam-dunk piece about something timely only to see it get crushed in the readership stats by the 2021 marijuana explainer.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_27567" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1500px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gleaf-tour-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-27567 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gleaf-tour-1.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gleaf-tour-1.jpg 1500w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gleaf-tour-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gleaf-tour-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gleaf-tour-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gleaf-tour-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gleaf-tour-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gleaf-tour-1-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Former Attorney General Mark Herring tours gLeaf Medical, a medical marijuana dispensary in Richmond, ahead of the July 1, 2021 legalization of recreational adult use.

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">8. A military-themed brewery sparks a fight in a Virginia military city</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This story, by freelancer Jim Morrison, delved into the very intense debate that broke out in Norfolk over the proposed Armed Forces Brewing Company, which has leaned hard into flamboyant military marketing and tapped a brand ambassador who has made numerous anti-LGBTQ comments online. Local permitting and zoning disputes like this one often engender strong feelings, but Armed Forces Brewing turned them up to 11. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">9. TikTok trend spurs record-breaking numbers of Virginians to cash out unclaimed property</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look, we get it. We may be trying to do Serious Policy Journalism over here, but you just want to read about TikTok and money you might be able to get back from the state. At least read FOIA Friday before you head over to the app. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">10. Va. ABC official files whistleblower suit, alleging retaliation for reporting millions in losses</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This article about a lawsuit filed by a whistleblower at Virginia’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority is part of a string of investigative pieces by Meghan McIntyre, whose interest in ABC began with a question about </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/19/modernizing-abc-says-counter-service-stores-are-on-their-way-out/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">how the state decides which stores put their liquor behind glass partitions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Things clearly escalated from there. </span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Getty_gavel-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a reversal of an earlier decision, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that an officer’s stop of two Black men in a Waynesboro neighborhood on suspicion of involvement in a home invasion that had just occurred had not violated one man&#8217;s rights against unreasonable seizure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/0868213.pdf" target="_blank">a majority opinion</a>, Judge Lisa Lorish wrote that the officer “possessed a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity to briefly detain” one of the men until other officers arrived within several minutes to provide additional information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judges Dominique Callins and Vernida Chaney both dissented, with Chaney writing in a sharply worded opinion that “today, while purporting to ‘make no new law,’ the majority grants police license to seize a Black man at gunpoint for merely walking late at night within the wide general area of a recent crime and ‘matching’ the race and gender of the suspects.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case stems from a home invasion and pistol-whipping in Waynesboro that was reported by the victims around 11 p.m on a night in February 2020. After police responded to the home, officers issued a “be on the lookout” dispatch for three armed Black men “wearing black sweatshirts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dispatch was heard by Augusta County Sheriff’s Deputy C. Stroop, who went by the house, spoke to officers there and then began to drive around the neighborhood to look for the perpetrators. Within what the court later determined were six to 10 blocks from the crime scene, he saw two Black men, Arun Rashid Turay and Justice Ahmed Carr, walking and stopped them at gunpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly one and a half to two minutes later, other Waynesboro officers arrived. One of the responding officers confirmed Turay’s clothing matched security video footage but said Carr’s did not. When the men were searched, officers found credit cards belonging to one of the victims in Carr’s pocket and a victim’s keys and bloody clothes and shoes in a bookbag on Turay. Both men were arrested and later pled guilty to armed burglary and other charges after the court decided that the evidence found as a result of Stroop’s stop could be considered in the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In different cases, Turay and Carr each appealed the Waynesboro judge’s decision not to suppress that evidence. Turay’s challenges have sparked a string of different rulings from the Virginia Court of Appeals, which has flip-flopped on whether the stop was constitutional, ruling first against Turay, then in his favor and, most recently, against him once more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turay had argued that the evidence from the searches shouldn’t be allowed to be used because Stroop’s stop was an unconstitutional seizure not supported by “reasonable suspicion” that he was involved in the robbery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. and Virginia courts have dealt at length with the thorny question of what constitutes reasonable suspicion. In Virginia, the courts have assessed, among other tests, whether an officer’s reasonable suspicion is based on “specific and articulable facts” as well as “an assessment of the totality of the circumstances.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of a stop related to a specific crime, the appeals court on Tuesday wrote that an officer could consider factors such as a person’s distance from where a crime is committed, the amount of time that has elapsed between the crime and the stop, the degree to which a person matches a description of a suspect, the suspect’s behavior and how many other people matching a description might be present. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her opinion, Lorish conceded that the vague description of the suspects in the be-on-the-lookout dispatch “was too general to give rise to reasonable suspicion to detain any person.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without more, this vague description could not allow police to reasonably detain any Black male wearing dark clothing as a suspect in the crime,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, she continued, other circumstances were relevant: Turay and Carr were seen within 10 blocks of the crime scene and within roughly 30 minutes of the police report. They were on foot. And they were the only people walking in the neighborhood late on a cold February night. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These factors all increase the relevance of Turay matching what would otherwise be a vague or general description,” the court found. Ultimately, it determined, “we cannot say Deputy Stroop lacked reasonable suspicion under the totality of the circumstances.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dissenting judges, however, argued the ruling “disregards the well-established protections of the Fourth Amendment and, in effect, authorizes race-based seizures of persons who appear to be engaged in innocent, lawful activity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaney contended that “at the time of the seizure, there was no particularized, objective basis for suspecting Turay of criminal activity.” Instead of the black sweatshirt described in the be-on-the-lookout announcement, she noted, Turay was wearing “a long-sleeved black top with a wide red stripe down each sleeve and a wide blue panel on each side,” while Carr was wearing a “long-sleeved white top.” Neither appeared to be armed. Only two men were walking, rather than the three described in the dispatch. And, the judge maintained, the deputy only testified that “not a lot” of people were around rather than saying definitively he had seen no one else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The totality of the facts and circumstances known at the time of the seizure does not give rise to reasonable, articulable suspicion that Turay participated in the robbery even if no other people were observed out on the street when the deputy first observed Turay,” she wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Callins said the majority ruling “would be akin to holding that, when a Black man commits a crime and flees, any Black man in the vicinity is inherently a suspect.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Racially motivated stops are a pervasive problem in our society, and we must examine whether a stop could be justified by any information available to the officer before determining that the stop was illegal,” she wrote. “But I cannot say, given the totality of the circumstances, that this stop justified as particularized.”</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin being greeted before presenting his proposed budget recommendations for the 2024-26 biennial on Dec. 20 at the General Assembly Building in Richmond. (Nathaniel Cline/VIrginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the halfway point of his administration, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin unveiled a budget proposal that calls for significant income tax cuts, increases in state sales and use tax — and a push to get rid of the car tax, which the Republican called “the single most hated tax” in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The car tax belongs in the trash can and not in your mailbox,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking to the state’s joint money committees Wednesday morning, Youngkin reiterated his familiar themes that Virginia must take action to reverse ongoing population losses to other states and reduce residents’ tax burdens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across the country today, there are winning states and there are losing states,” he said. “Virginia must compete even harder.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the governor’s speech took a less political tone than earlier addresses to the state’s legislative budget architects, offering fewer criticisms of prior administrations and acknowledging that Virginia government remains divided after Democrats narrowly won control of both chambers of the legislature this November. That outcome dampened Youngkin’s prospects for a presidential run and will force him to work across the aisle to achieve his key priorities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Virginia operates on a two-year budget that is amended annually, the “Unleashing Opportunity” budget presented by Youngkin Wednesday represents the governor’s first crack at crafting a state spending plan from whole cloth. The last two-year budget, which was passed in 2022, was based on a plan from outgoing Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With power divided between Democrats and Republicans in Richmond and historic state surpluses fueled by pandemic-era relief spending, the past few years have seen unusual levels of contention over the state budget. Amendments to the spending plan, ordinarily passed at the time the General Assembly adjourns in late February or early March, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/05/whats-in-virginias-long-delayed-2023-budget-deal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">took until September this year to come to fruition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the parties bickered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would ask us to deliver a budget on time when you adjourn sine die in March,” </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/december/name-1019257-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin told the money committees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Wednesday, referring to the final adjournment of the legislative session. “Virginians deserve it, and I know we can do it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, lawmakers will have less money at their disposal, with pandemic-era infusions of cash at an end and state economic officials projecting a mild recession beginning in the last quarter of fiscal year 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “overwhelming consensus” of state leaders, said Youngkin, was that in developing the budget, “we should build in caution.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have already signaled concerns with the governor’s spending plan — and some surprise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I heard the governor say this was halftime. And he came back out as a Democrat, a lot of tax increases,” wisecracked incoming House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, in an exchange with Virginia Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Democrats on Wednesday afternoon issued a statement calling the governor’s budget “absolutely disgraceful” and “a slap in the face of our most vulnerable individuals.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are smart enough and bold enough to know that his speech was the highlight reel and that he omitted the dirty details of his plan,” the caucus wrote. “Governor Youngkin believes that ensuring more tax cuts for wealthier individuals is most beneficial for low income individuals in our commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal put forward by the governor Wednesday marks only the beginning of the state’s budget season. When the General Assembly convenes Jan. 10, both chambers will have a chance to modify Youngkin’s budget, removing parts they don’t like and accepting or strengthening those they do. The House and Senate will then need to reconcile their two versions of the plan — a process that historically has occurred behind closed doors through the legislature’s opaque conference committee system — and send it to the governor for his review. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While we appreciate Governor Youngkin for sharing his budgetary vision today, it is imperative that we have a thorough examination of his proposal,” said Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William, the incoming chair of the House Appropriations Committee. “This is the starting point to construct a budget that not only reflects our dedication, but also secures prosperity and fairness for every resident in the commonwealth.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s some of what Youngkin is proposing at the starting line. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax reforms</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has heavily emphasized tax reduction over the course of his administration, and the issue is the centerpiece of his budget proposal. Reducing the cost of living for Virginians, he argued Wednesday, requires reducing tax burdens and modernizing the state’s sales tax code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is calling for a 12% cut in income taxes across the board that would see the tax rate drop from 2% to 1.75% for the lowest bracket and from 5.75% to 5.1% for the highest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This cut reduces the personal income tax burden on Virginians by $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2025 and $2.3 billion in fiscal year 2026 and is a major, major step towards competing,” Youngkin said. “The data is clear: Since 2021, 26 states have cut individual income tax rates.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To partly offset that loss in state revenues, the governor is proposing to increase the state’s sales and use tax from 4.3% to 5.2%, as well as expand the base of goods and services that tax applies to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia taxes a narrow set of goods while our peer states tax a broader set of goods and services,” said Youngkin. To remedy that, he is asking the state to close what he called the “Big Tech tax loophole” on digital goods such as software packages, digital downloads, streaming services and more, “on which today, Virginia collects nothing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have already pushed back against the tax changes. In a statement, Scott said Virginia “must champion policies that address the pressing issues faced by our citizens – not those that would be detrimental to the financial well-being of low-income and middle class households, exacerbating economic disparities. By lowering taxes for the wealthiest Virginians and raising local and state sales tax, the burden is shifted onto those least able to afford it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about those concerns, Youngkin said he was “very cognizant” of them, “and that’s why we included an increase in the earned income tax credit, so that in fact there would be support for Virginians who are on the lower-income scale.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the governor’s plan, lower-income residents would be able to claim an enhanced earned income tax credit equal to 25% of the federal credit, rather than the existing 20% credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can reduce the tax burden and include a very important tax reform, which is shifting the burden of personal income taxes onto a sales tax system that is truly outdated and archaic,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Car tax</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not included in his budget plan, the governor urged lawmakers to work to permanently eliminate the car tax local governments are currently allowed to levy and instead have localities rely on further increases in sales tax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everywhere I go, I consistently hear, ‘Please help us get rid of the car tax,’” he told reporters. “We need to work together to get rid of this.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34493" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/95-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-34493 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/95-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1913" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/95-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/95-300x224.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/95-1024x765.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/95-768x574.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/95-1536x1148.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/95-2048x1530.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Evening traffic on Interstate 95 through Richmond. (Wyatt Gordon)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outgoing Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, noted the commonwealth spends almost $1 billion annually to reduce the car tax in localities and asked whether getting rid of the tax would require a constitutional amendment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The [Virginia] Constitution gives the car tax to the localities,” he said. “So how’s [he] going to do that, to abolish the car tax?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings said eliminating the tax would require a complex process and “a lot of changes and legislation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After his presentation, Youngkin told reporters, “I believe we would not eliminate the state subsidy of $950 million a year, that we can work in collaboration with local governments to settle on an increase in local and state sales and use taxes.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Continued increases in education spending</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next biennium, Youngkin is proposing an additional $764 million for Virginia’s K-12 schools, including $160 million for re-benchmarking — the process of updating the amounts the state provides in direct aid to schools — $122 million to cover another 2% raise for teachers in fiscal year 2026 and $53 million for a 1% bonus in fiscal year 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also proposed investing $61 million to expand the hiring of reading specialists, $40 million to support students seeking industry-recognized credentials through “Diploma Plus” grants and $40 million to develop a new state assessment system.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More behavioral health investments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is proposing $316 million in the budget for his </span><a href="https://www.hhr.virginia.gov/behavioral-health/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right Help, Right Now”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plan to further expand access to behavioral and mental health services across the commonwealth. This includes over $150 million to add additional developmental disability waivers, which fund services for people with long-term care needs. The governor’s plan aims to provide waivers to the </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/december/name-1018954-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3,400 Virginians currently on the “priority one” waitlist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — consisting of those individuals who urgently need the services and support offered by the waiver in a year or less. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is going to be a big initiative, but with the providers out there seeing this money is there, I think we can generate the kind of infrastructure we need to help address this important area,&#8221; said Virginia Department of Planning and Budget Director Michael Maul. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over $35 million will go toward funding additional crisis services, like Virginia’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/10/virginias-mental-health-hotline-one-year-later/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">988 suicide and crisis system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and crisis stabilization units, to minimize response services that rely on emergency rooms and hospitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional $58 million is being invested in behavioral health loan repayment, more clinical training sites and residency slots and salary increases for state hospital clinicians. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/12/12/jlarc-recommends-changes-to-bed-of-last-resort-law-more-private-psychiatric-admissions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new JLARC report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this month found Virginia’s nine psychiatric hospitals are increasingly short on both beds and staff, which poses risks for both patients and personnel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to hiring, “we are competing with McDonalds and Starbucks,” Maul said, “and it’s hard sometimes to get the people we need.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Medicaid spending</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget includes $714 million to fund the cost of Medicaid while adjusting for inflation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maul said this biennial budget includes significantly more money than the previous two-year spending plan because the state’s Health Care Fund, which is sourced from tobacco taxes, has less money to cover Medicaid costs than it did in prior years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During COVID, Maul said Medicaid enrollees “weren’t going to their doctors or getting their checkups,” so Virginia spent less to pay for providers than what was initially budgeted. Now, he said, the state is expecting a significant rise in utilization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not expecting very big amounts to go into the Health Care Fund, and tobacco tax revenues are going down,” Maul said. “We believe we’re going to need over $250 million a year to help offset the fact that those funds will not be available to help with Medicaid.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Child care</h4>

	</strong></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Fj1krSd53t"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/07/youngkin-announces-plan-for-millions-in-early-childhood-and-child-care-spending/">Youngkin announces plan for millions in early childhood and child care spending</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Building Blocks for Virginia Families initiative, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/12/07/youngkin-announces-plan-for-millions-in-early-childhood-and-child-care-spending/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced by Youngkin earlier this month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would put $437 million toward child care and early childhood education programs in an effort to keep child care accessible to families struggling to shoulder its high costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday’s proposal is $10 million less than the governor previously outlined but would put $412 million toward the state child care subsidy program and $25 million to help with startup costs for providers in areas that lack child care services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were using a big chunk of one-time funding, of public funding, to help subsidize the cost for child care,” said Maul. “That’s one of our biggest economic development issues, because if workers can’t find child care, they can’t get to work.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission recently found that </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/16/state-report-finds-child-care-is-unaffordable-for-most-virginia-families-with-young-kids/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child care is unaffordable for the vast majority of Virginians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The whole goal is to make sure that anybody in the program today and those who would likely be in the program can continue to do so in the next biennium,” said Maul.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Funding for some wastewater projects, but not all</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond would get $50 million for its combined sewer overflow system, a 19th-century form of infrastructure that has wastewater and stormwater flow through the same pipes. During heavy rainfall, the system becomes overwhelmed, causing wastewater to be released into the James River. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="w2GDjHhKNQ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/06/state-funding-for-richmond-sewer-project-stripped-out-of-budget-deal/">State funding for Richmond sewer project stripped out of budget deal</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly has set a 2035 deadline for the city to upgrade its system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the General Assembly initially proposed giving Richmond an extra $100 million for the work, but it was eliminated from </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/06/state-funding-for-richmond-sewer-project-stripped-out-of-budget-deal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the September spending plan to fund other initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The city has said it needs $100 million in state funds in each of the next five years to keep from raising customer rates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposal lacks new additions to the Water Quality Improvement Fund for wastewater treatment projects, which have helped the state make strides in preventing pollution from entering waterways. A $238 million shortfall is projected for 10 projects over the next two years, </span><a href="https://studiesvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/meeting_docs/documents/000/001/903/original/DEQ_-_WQIF_Update_State_Water_Commission_Meeting_12152023.pdf?1702596393" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Environmental Quality Director Mike Rolband recently told the State Water Commission.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Director Chris Moore said, “While we applaud these historic investments, there remains significant need for resources to Virginia’s wastewater sector to continue the tremendous progress they have made in reducing pollution to the Bay.”</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">No new increases for Metro</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Metro’s threats of potential service cuts and fare increases in response to a $750 million shortfall, the governor’s budget includes no additional funding for the bus and rail operator above the state’s normal allocation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said before any funding is appropriated, a plan must be created to address the change in ridership and demand for services. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_33570" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_9747-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-33570 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_9747-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_9747-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_9747-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_9747-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_9747-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_9747-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/IMG_9747-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A view of the Tysons Corner Metrorail Station in Fairfax County. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am a huge supporter of Metro,” Youngkin said after his presentation. “It is critically important to Virginia and the entire DMV. But we need to face reality here and develop a business plan that works for Virginia, for the District and for Maryland, and then we will talk about what we will do in order to support it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro said Virginia’s proposed contribution for fiscal year 2025 is $347.9 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro said it needs notification of what the neighboring jurisdictions will provide by mid-March to make any budget adjustments.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s own biosciences ‘research triangle’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is proposing $100 million for the creation of the Virginia Biotechnology, Life Sciences, and Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Network, which the governor described as “Virginia’s own version of the research triangle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It will be mainly to our research institutions and other entities that are helping us to become more competitive and to hopefully draw companies to Virginia who want to take advantage of those resources,” Maul told the money committees.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Virginia’s Manning Institute for Biotechnology would receive $50 million, $27 million would go to Virginia Tech’s Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and $13 million to VCU’s Medicines for All Institute, according to a </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/december/name-1018813-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dec. 11</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Flood Fund</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Community Flood Preparedness Fund, which helps pay for resilience projects to address flooding from stormwater and sea level rise, would get a $100 million boost from Youngkin, who is continuing to push for Virginia’s withdrawal from the regional carbon market that has been providing revenue for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We just have so many challenges around Virginia dealing with storm surge and floods that we’re trying to address,” Maul said.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund has received half of the over $700 million the state has gotten from its participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which requires electricity producers to purchase allowances for the carbon they emit.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin said allocating money to the Flood Fund is “how these programs should be funded.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s transparent, it’s part of something we need to do, and it’s not a hidden tax on someone’s bill that they never see that was sold as something that it was not,” he said. “By removing RGGI and taking up the responsibility to fund through the general fund, we have transparency and are still accomplishing our goal.” </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Tammy Brankley Mulchi and Democrat Tina Wyatt Younger will face off in a special election this January to represent state Senate District 9 in Southside Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters elected long-time Sen. Frank Ruff this November to represent the district, which encompasses Pittsylvania, Halifax, Charlotte, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg and Nottoway counties, the southern part of Prince Edward County and the city of Danville. Ahead of being sworn in to his next term, however, Ruff announced that he would not take office due to a cancer diagnosis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who on Wednesday asked the General Assembly during his budget presentation to rename the commonwealth’s Center for Rural Virginia in Ruff’s honor, has set the special election for Jan. 9, the day before the General Assembly reconvenes for the 2024 session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a Dec. 20 deadline for candidates to file with the state Department of Elections to run in that race, both Republicans and Democrats held nominating contests Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans held a six-hour mass meeting in Drakes Branch in Charlotte County Tuesday night, selecting Mulchi, who had been endorsed by Ruff, after four rounds of voting. Six people ran for the nomination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A member of the Clarksville Town Council and realtor, Mulchi previously served as a legislative aide to Ruff and Del. Tommy Wright, R-Lunenburg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Southside Virginia faces challenges unlike other regions of Virginia. The people of the region need a senator who shares their conservative values, understands the challenges facing their region, and knows how to meet those challenges by increasing opportunities,” said Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, in a statement. “Tammy Mulchi will be that senator, and she has the full support of her future colleagues in the Senate Republican Caucus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats elected Younger, a former vice mayor of South Boston and chair of the Halifax Democrats, in a firehouse primary. With 89 votes, she narrowly edged out the next closest candidate, Danville vice mayor Gary Miller, who received 82 votes. Four candidates ran in the party’s firehouse primary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Democratic Caucus Chair Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, said in a statement that “Tina’s wealth of experience will greatly be an invaluable asset to our caucus.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given their background, I’m confident they will be yet another durable brick in our blue wall as we continue to ensure economic security, enhancing the quality of public education, and ensuring a bright future for every Virginian,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate District 9 is considered a strongly Republican district, with 65% of voters casting ballots for Republicans in elections in 2021 and 2022. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As many as 10 candidates will vie for party nominations for a Southside Virginia state Senate seat on Tuesday, Dec. 19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Sen. Frank Ruff, a 30-year veteran of the General Assembly, was elected this November to represent the new Senate District 9, encompassing Pittsylvania, Halifax, Charlotte, Lunenburg, Mecklenburg and Nottoway counties, the southern portion of Prince Edward County and the city of Danville. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, however, Ruff announced he will not take office for the 2024-28 term after a cancer diagnosis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Entering into an aggressive and ongoing treatment regimen, I have concluded I may not be able to devote 100% of my focus to doing the work needed in the General Assembly,” said Ruff in a statement. “Consequently, I believe now is the right time to retire.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the legislative session set to begin Jan. 10, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/castyourballot/Writ-for-Special-Election---SD-9.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has called a special election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fill the seat on Jan. 9, 2024. Because candidates must file with the Virginia Department of Elections by Dec. 20 in order to appear on the ballot, both Democrats and Republicans in the district are holding their nominating contests one day earlier, on Dec. 19. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Public Access Project </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/state-senate-9/district/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ranks the district strongly Republican</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the 2022 congressional races, roughly 65% of voters cast their ballots for a Republican. The same percentage also voted for Youngkin over former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in the 2021 gubernatorial election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, parties are allowed to choose their nominating method for candidates. Republicans have chosen to hold a mass meeting at Drakes Branch Fire Department at 4801 Main St., Drakes Branch, at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, with registration beginning at 5 p.m. In this approach, all voters must be present at the meeting location during balloting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re expecting up to four rounds of voting,” said Will Pace, chair of the 9th Senate District Republican Committee and the Pittsylvania County Republicans. “This is not a drive-by vote and leave thing. This is something where you need to commit your entire night. We’re expecting it to be a long night.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If rules for the meeting are approved as anticipated, candidates with fewer votes will be progressively eliminated as the night goes on. Voters must bring photo identification, be in line by 6:30 to participate and sign a statement saying they will support the Republican candidate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pace said he was anticipating a turnout of up to 500 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six Republicans are in the running for Ruff’s seat. They include retiring Del. Jim Edmunds, Halifax pastor and business owner Andy Ferguson, legislative aide Kade Gravitt, Clarksville Town Council member Tammy Brankley Mulchi, Virginia Board of Education member Dale Sturdifen and Danville City Councilman Lee Vogler. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-37291" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9-298x300.png" alt="" width="298" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9-298x300.png 298w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9-150x150.png 150w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9-768x774.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Dems-SD9.png 837w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruff has endorsed Mulchi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, in turn, have chosen to nominate their candidate through the unassembled caucus process, also known as a firehouse primary. This method allows voters to cast a ballot during the specified time window but doesn’t require them to stay for the entire balloting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patricia Harper-Tunley, a member of the Senate District 9 Democratic Nominating Committee and chair of the Lunenburg County Democratic Committee, said four people “have shown interest” in the seat but that names won’t be released until after the caucus filing deadline of noon Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters will be able to cast their ballots at any of seven locations in the district between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s the time frame that we have,” said Harper Tunley. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, only one candidate has publicly announced they are seeking the seat. Trudy Berry, an Air Force veteran from Lunenburg, ran a write-in campaign against Ruff this fall after a local Democratic party official </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/15/virginia-elections-board-declines-to-help-democrat-bounced-from-ballot-over-partys-typo/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accidentally mistyped an email address</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when attempting to file her paperwork to run, leading to Berry being disqualified. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Berry, however, said that over the weekend, state Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, who will become Senate Majority Leader when the 2024 legislative session begins, called her and asked her to withdraw her candidacy in favor of Danville Vice Mayor Gary Miller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I told him I was appalled that he even had the gall to ask me to step down,” said Berry, who called the request “a bad look on the party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surovell was traveling Monday and did not immediately provide a comment on Berry’s account of the conversation.</span></p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that four people had shown interest in the Democratic seat as of Monday afternoon.  </em></p>

(JW Caterine / For Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Corrections will close four prisons and take control of the state’s only privately operated prison this summer, officials said Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augusta Correctional Center, Sussex II State Prison, Haynesville Correctional Unit #17 and Stafford Community Corrections Alternative Program will close July 1, 2024. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The department said the closures are intended “to enhance employee, inmate, and probationer safety, to address longstanding staffing challenges, and in consideration of significant ongoing maintenance costs.” </span></p>

<p>According to the most recent Virginia Department of Corrections population report, 1,889 inmates are housed at the Augusta, Sussex II and Haynesville facilities. The Stafford program is an alternative to incarceration. VADOC spokesperson Kyle Gibson said in an  email that &#8220;inmates will be transferred to different VADOC facilities throughout the commonwealth, based on security level and classification.&#8221;</p>
<p>The agency said it has begun identifying job placement opportunities for employees at the affected facilities &#8220;to ensure that all employees who wish to remain employed with the VADOC will be able to stay with the agency.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia will also end its contract with Florida-based GEO Group to operate the Lawrenceville Correctional Center in Brunswick County on Aug. 1, 2024. The medium-security prison has been operated privately since 1998 and under GEO management since 2003. </span></p>
<p>Asked why the state was assuming control of the facility, Gibson said only that the move would &#8220;enhance public safety in the commonwealth.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prison reform advocates have pushed for control of Lawrenceville to be turned back over to the state for many years, arguing that private companies&#8217; need to produce profits leads them to cut corners in staffing and other resources that endanger inmate safety. In 2021, Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, proposed legislation that would have prohibited the state government from contracting with private prison operators, but it <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/01/15/proposal-to-end-for-profit-prison-management-fails-in-virginia-senate/" target="_blank">was defeated in committee</a>. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/26/virginia-considers-private-prison-contract-renewal-despite-4-3-million-in-breaches/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporting by the Mercury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that persistent staffing shortages at the facility have led the Virginia Department of Corrections to repeatedly dock its payments to GEO for operation of Lawrenceville due to the company’s failure to meet minimum staffing levels required by contract. Between August 2018 and October 2022, those deductions totaled $4.3 million. Roughly three-quarters of the costs were linked to shortages between October 2021 and October 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2020/RD516/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Virginia Department of Corrections found that Lawrenceville’s operating costs would increase by $9.3 million if the state assumed control, largely to pay for “an increase of 93 correctional officers needed to provide adequate relief staffing and to address operational security needs.” </span></p>
<p>&#8220;It takes courage to close a prison,&#8221; said Rev. Dr. LaKeisha Cook, a board member for Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, which has urged Virginia to take over Lawrenceville and in October 2022 released <a href="https://virginiainterfaithcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lawrenceville-Correctional-Center-A-Prison-Run-Amok-2.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> on what it described as dangerous conditions at the prison. &#8220;This is a significant step in the right direction.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the Virginia Department of Corrections said it has been informed that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s budget proposal, which he will present to the House and Senate money committees this Wednesday, includes additional funding for the state to take over Lawrenceville safely next year. Gibson said the corrections department &#8220;is expected to make capital improvements with existing funds to upgrade and renovate the facility.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly will also come up with its own proposal for the two-year budget during the next legislative session that begins in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Terry Cole said Youngkin’s budget “enhances public safety and increases efficiency inside Virginia’s prisons for staff members, inmates and everyone who lives and works in Virginia.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe these steps will help the VADOC further its mission of public safety and operational excellence,” he said. </span></p>
<p>A GEO Group spokesman said the company &#8220;look[s] forward to working with the Virginia Department of Corrections to ensure a seamless transition.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“GEO has been a long-standing partner to the Commonwealth of Virginia, and we are proud of our record of managing the Lawrenceville Correctional Center on behalf of the Virginia Department of Corrections for more than two decades,&#8221; the spokesman wrote. &#8220;We are grateful for our front line employees who have provided high-quality services, including enhanced rehabilitation programs, to those in our care.</p>

(Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt584.pdf" target="_blank">a sweeping report</a> released Monday, a state commission recommended changes to Virginia’s decade-old “bed of last resort” law and urged the state to put greater pressure on private hospitals to accept patients under commitment orders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals, put forward by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, a state body that conducts studies for the General Assembly, are aimed at helping relieve Virginia’s beleaguered psychiatric hospital system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For years, Virginia state hospitals have routinely operated at their maximum capacities,” said JLARC Director Hal Greer. “The General Assembly’s and administration’s efforts to build out much-needed crisis response services statewide will hopefully alleviate the need for many Virginians to be involuntarily placed in an inpatient hospital. But it will take some time before we will start to see the census pressures at state hospitals relieved by these investments.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s nine psychiatric hospitals — eight of which serve adults and one, the Commonwealth Center for Children and Adolescents in Staunton, devoted to youth — have increasingly found themselves short on both beds and staff. While industry standards say no more than 85% of staffed beds at psychiatric hospitals should be filled due to safety concerns, JLARC found that bed capacity at seven state hospitals routinely exceeds 95%, with three operating at 100%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crisis peaked in 2021, when staff shortages caused the Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/09/more-than-half-of-virginias-state-run-mental-hospitals-are-closing-to-new-admissions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">close five state hospitals to new admissions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Officials and experts say overcrowding in psychiatric hospitals produces risks for both patients and staff. JLARC’s findings bear that out: Between January 2022 and May 2023, the commission found 7,400 “physical incidents” occurred between patients at state psychiatric hospitals, with nearly 900 of them resulting in patient injury. At least 20% of staff at all nine hospitals reported they did not believe their facility was a safe place for patients; at Southern Virginia Mental Health Institute in Danville, that percentage was 42%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the worst hospitals identified by JLARC is the Commonwealth Center for Children and Adolescents, which mostly serves youth between the ages of 12 and 17 and which the commission recommends lawmakers consider closing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CCCA “has the highest rate of patient-on-patient and patient-on-staff physical safety incidents, the highest rate of patient self-harm, the highest number and percentage of substantiated human rights complaints, the highest use of physical restraint against patients, the highest staff turnover, nearly the highest staff vacancy rate, and the greatest dependence on expensive contract staff,” the commission wrote. An unannounced inspection of the facility in May by national accrediting agency the Joint Commission found 28 serious violations, leading the behavioral health department to determine the hospital was “an immediate threat to the health and safety of patients.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the state has since taken steps to fix problems at the hospital, JLARC recommended the state develop plans for transferring its patients elsewhere or providing services at crisis stabilization centers closer to their home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, said the human rights violation numbers were “abhorrent” and that “concerning would be a generous word” to describe the findings on the youth hospital.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It turns my stomach, and I know it does yours too,” he told Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services Commissioner Nelson Smith. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been working aggressively. We did not take it lightly,” said Smith. “We removed the leadership there, which we believe is what triggered the Joint Commission arriving to the facility.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Resources John Littel in a letter said JLARC’s report “underscores the urgent need for a transformation in the commonwealth’s mental health system,” one he said Virginia has already taken steps to begin through </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/14/youngkin-proposes-230-million-behavioral-health-overhaul/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s “Right Help, Right Now” plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The JLARC report rightly points out the system&#8217;s overreliance on state psychiatric hospitals for all levels of care, emphasizing the need for a shift towards putting individuals first,” he said. “The outdated approach disproportionately allocates limited resources to inpatient treatment, rather than meeting individuals where they are.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Bed of last resort</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday’s JLARC report indicates much of the overuse of state hospitals is due to the state’s 2014 bed of last resort law, which requires state psychiatric hospitals to accept any patient under a temporary detention order if a bed cannot be found at a privately operated facility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since then, state hospitals have experienced significant ongoing capacity constraints and have regularly admitted more patients than they can safely accommodate,” the commission wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About half of all admissions to state psychiatric hospitals are patients who are involuntarily committed after officials determine they are “substantially likely” to pose an imminent risk to themselves or others but are unwilling to voluntarily be hospitalized for treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia’s involuntary commitment process, a patient is first placed under an emergency custody order and then evaluated by the local community services board and a magistrate to decide whether they meet the criteria for a temporary detention order. A TDO allows the person to be held for up to 72 hours for adults or 96 hours for youth for mental health treatment; if a judge determines the patient requires further inpatient care, a civil commitment order allows them to be held for up to 30 days for adults or 90 for youth, with the possibility of extensions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finding a psychiatric bed for patients under a TDO often proves difficult, however. State law gives officials eight hours to find a bed for people in emergency custody or else release them. If a bed in a privately operated hospital cannot be found, the patient must be admitted to one of the nine state-run institutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bed of last resort requirement was the result of tragedy. In 2013, state mental health officials were unable to find a bed for Austin “Gus” Deeds, the son of state Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, who had been placed under an emergency custody order while undergoing a mental health episode. After being sent home to his family, Gus Deeds stabbed his father 13 times before shooting himself. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tZBxiOeLcI"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/26/more-patients-in-crisis-falling-through-cracks-of-state-psychiatric-commitment-system/">More patients in crisis falling through cracks of state psychiatric commitment system</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;More patients in crisis falling through cracks of state psychiatric commitment system&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/26/more-patients-in-crisis-falling-through-cracks-of-state-psychiatric-commitment-system/embed/#?secret=X8lpDjdrKz#?secret=tZBxiOeLcI" data-secret="tZBxiOeLcI" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Deeds survived the attack and the next year carried the bed of last resort law to ensure that no Virginian in crisis fell through the cracks again. JLARC noted Monday that “increased admissions to state hospitals likely mean the law has served as a safety net for many Virginians experiencing psychiatric emergencies.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has also had unintended consequences. JLARC found it has “contributed to the increase in inappropriate admissions to state hospitals, such as patients with dementia or intellectual disabilities, whom state hospitals are not equipped to treat.” And, the commission continued, it “does not allow state hospitals to deny admission to an individual under a TDO, even if it does not have sufficient numbers of staff, staff with the right types of expertise or training to treat them, or adequate physical space or equipment for use in treating them.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State hospital workers interviewed by the commission said the law leads to unsustainable and unsafe circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The admissions policy that requires this facility to take in more clients regardless of our facility’s ability (or lack thereof) due to staffing and bed availability, is not only dangerous for all involved but sends a clear message to the employees that they are not important or valued,” said one staffer. “Something has to give! People are frustrated and many are getting hurt or worse.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC is floating several possible changes to the law to relieve the pressure. One would give state hospitals the authority to deny new TDO admissions if 85% of their beds are filled. Another would amend statutory definitions of mental illness to exclude neurocognitive and neurodevelopmental disorders like dementia, traumatic brain injury and autism spectrum disorders from the list of diagnoses that could qualify an individual for involuntary commitment under a TDO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s current definition of mental illness can allow individuals who solely have dementia or an intellectual or developmental disability to meet the criteria for a civil TDO or civil commitment,” said Drew Dickinson, the project leader for the JLARC review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State hospitals are seeing increasing numbers of those patients, said JLARC, even though there is little treatment state psychiatric hospitals can provide them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For an individual who is under a TDO but who … does not need psychiatric treatment, being placed in a psychiatric hospital where they will not receive effective treatment for their primary diagnoses is both counterproductive and unsafe,” the commission wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith, however, cautioned in a letter that efforts to reduce the populations of individuals with neurocognitive or neurodevelopmental disorders from state hospitals could have “unintended consequences.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is a high mental illness co-occurrence rate for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (DD),” he wrote. “Determining whether an individual&#8217;s behaviors and symptoms are because of DD or a co-occurring mental illness can be extremely challenging and complex.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deeds on Tuesday said the state has “recognized for a long time that we’ve had a problem with people in the psychiatric hospitals that don’t belong there.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Behavioral Health Commission, which he chairs, is scheduled to receive a briefing on JLARC’s findings Wednesday morning. Deeds said he’s eager to hear its recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want to be open minded about this. I don’t want to be so tied to what we’ve done in the past that I don’t want to look for new solutions that would be better,” he said. “If there are better ways to skin a cat, I want to be part of the solution.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Private hospitals and forensic patients</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With state hospitals overwhelmed with patients, JLARC is also suggesting that Virginia put pressure on privately operated hospitals to accept more patients under temporary detention orders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the report acknowledges that private psychiatric hospitals currently discharge about 10 times as many patients as state-run hospitals every year, it contends those facilities — which include not only freestanding psychiatric facilities but also psychiatric units in everything from teaching to large hospital chains — could accept more involuntary patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We acknowledge that privately operated hospitals are already accepting involuntary patients, but our analysis makes it clear they could be accepting many more,” said Greer Monday. “State policies are needed to encourage and perhaps direct these providers to accept more TDOs if they have the capacity to do so safely.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using numbers collected from the </span><a href="https://www.vhi.org/About/default.asp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Health Information database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, JLARC found that “31 of the 43 private psychiatric hospitals for adults used less than 85 percent of their average staffed bed capacity in 2022,” while “many of the hospitals operated far below that level.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those findings are not unique to 2022,” Dickinson told lawmakers. “Similar patterns of underutilization exist for prior years.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission calculated that if private psychiatric hospitals had occupied roughly half of their unused beds that year, “enough patients would have been diverted from adult state hospitals to allow them to operate at a safe capacity level.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia could also explore contracting with private hospitals to accept forensic patients — people facing criminal charges who must undergo competency evaluations or receive mental health treatment — JLARC said. Currently, all forensic patients are placed in state hospitals, where they are increasingly becoming a dominant population. In fiscal year 2023, the commission found, 47% of state hospital admissions were people facing criminal charges who had been ordered to receive psychiatric evaluations or treatments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“State law does not require that forensic patients be treated at state hospitals,” JLARC wrote. “If state hospitals remain the only inpatient setting for treating forensic patients, the capacity pressures on state hospitals are likely to worsen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julian Walker, a spokesperson for the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association, said privately operated hospitals in the state have “demonstrated a clear commitment” to increasing mental health access, including the Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters’ recent opening of </span><a href="https://wydaily.com/business/spotlight/2023/01/09/bc-childrens-hospital-of-the-kings-daughters-begins-new-era-of-care-with-inpatient-mental-health-facility/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a dedicated facility for youth mental health care in Norfolk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our members are handling the vast majority of both voluntary and involuntary behavioral health admissions in the commonwealth,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC noted that private hospitals “are justifiably concerned” about the risks of admitting more patients under TDOs and said the state could provide funding for additional security staff, training and facility upgrades to incentivize hospitals to increase their involuntary admissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also floated other possibilities for putting pressure on privately operated hospitals, ranging from conditioning state approval of new facilities or license renewals on a hospital’s agreement to accept more involuntary patients to increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates for treating such patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts, the commission said, has taken a similar approach in tying requirements that a facility accept patients who are under civil commitment orders to licensure.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Noting that Medicaid reimbursements “often fall short of the actual cost of care,” particularly for psychiatric patients who may require heavy investments of time and resources, Walker said proposals that “look to supplement them is a conversation that we are certainly open to having and would welcome.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will work with the General Assembly. We will work with the Youngkin administration. We will work with DBHDS,” he said. “We all share a similar or common goal.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And emailing. And texting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the consumer protection division of Virginia’s Office of the Attorney General received 1,006 complaints during the holiday season, generally defined as running from the two weeks before Thanksgiving through New Year’s Day, said spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all of those complaints may have been holiday related, said LaCivita. But because December’s high volume of shopping and end-of-year charitable donations encourage the unscrupulous to take advantage of people’s goodwill, Attorney General Jason Miyares is encouraging Virginians to take precautions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trust your gut,” said Miyares in a </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2650-december-01-2023-attorney-general-miyares-releases-holiday-shopping-guide-to-avoid-scams" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video guide to avoiding scammers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “If it seems off, it probably is off.”  </span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid websites that require you to wire money, use gift cards, or cryptocurrency.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When shopping online, make sure you’re paying through a secure website whose address begins with “https”.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re worried, google the seller’s name with the words “scam” or “complaint” to see if others have had negative experiences. </span></li>

(izanbar/Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia officials announced Thursday that the state has netted $729 million in federal funds to help pay for the expansion of the Long Bridge over the Potomac, widely seen as the biggest rail choke point along the East Coast. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This investment will help transform the rail system in Virginia, improving the flow of people and goods not only within the commonwealth, but up and down the East Coast,” said Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a statement. “This project’s impact on the commonwealth cannot be overstated — it will ease congestion, make our supply chain more resilient, improve freight movement in and out of our world-class port and boost local economies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The money follows an announcement earlier this week, </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/raleigh/2023/12/06/raleigh-richmond-high-speed-passenger-rail-1-billion-thom-tillis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first reported by Axios</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that the U.S. Department of Transportation will spend $1 billion on a passenger rail line between Richmond and Raleigh, North Carolina. While Virginia Passenger Rail Authority spokesperson Karina Romero noted that none of that money will be spent on work in Virginia — it will go toward construction between Raleigh and Wake Forest — she said “it will definitely aid in the completion of the Richmond to Raleigh project.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest funds come from the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Grant Program, created through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Long Bridge rail project barrels forward full speed ahead&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/09/14/long-bridge-rail-project-barrels-full-speed-ahead/embed/#?secret=DKlN1wRamq#?secret=u9OK7xE7El" data-secret="u9OK7xE7El" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under former Gov. Ralph Northam, Virginia began investing heavily in rail improvements, particularly along major interstate corridors. In 2019, with the goal of expanding passenger and commuter rail throughout the state, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/local/305/2021/03/31/983044429/virginia-finalizes-3-7-billion-deal-to-acquire-tracks-from-c-s-x" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia struck a $525 million agreement with CSX Transportation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to acquire 223 miles of track and 384 miles of right-of-way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Long Bridge, a two-track span over the Potomac that is more than a century old, is a critical part of the state’s plans. Owned by CSX, the conduit is the sole way for trains to cross from Virginia into Washington, D.C.; the alternative is a rail bridge nearly 70 miles west at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Officials have said the Potomac bridge operates at 98% capacity at peak hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All the rail in the Northeast to get to the Southeast has to come over that Long Bridge that was first built in 1808,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, told reporters Thursday. “It’s been rebuilt since then, but it’s been a choke point that really ratchets down the degree to which you can put both freight and passenger rail from Virginia into D.C.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To alleviate the bottleneck the current infrastructure causes, </span><a href="https://vapassengerrailauthority.org/longbridgeproject/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia plans to construct a new two-track bridge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directly adjacent to the Long Bridge for passenger rail, doubling capacity across the Potomac. A new bicycle and pedestrian bridge will also be built between Arlington and Washington, D.C. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $729 million the state was awarded this week will “fill a financial gap” in Virginia’s efforts to not only build the new Long Bridge but also lay a third track along a rail corridor in Prince William, Stafford and Spotsylvania counties, said members of the state’s congressional delegation this October in </span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/101823longbridgeletter.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Part of the money will also go toward improvements to the L’Enfant Plaza Metro station on the D.C. side of the Long Bridge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The additional tracks, officials have said, will also allow for more separation of freight and passenger rail service, such as Amtrak and the Virginia Railway Express.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those projects “are an essential means to providing extra passenger rail service in the commonwealth that is needed now more than ever,” wrote Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner and Reps. Gerry Connolly, Don Beyer, Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer McClellan in the October letter. “Rail ridership on Virginia’s state-supported Amtrak service is setting records every month.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said the $729 million will expand service not only in Virginia’s eastern corridor, but also other portions of the state that are served by east-west lines. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The information we are gathering is intended to educate legislators on the need for more transparency and accountability for taxpayer funded institutions that still experiment on animals,” wrote PETA Senior Vice President of Cruelty Investigations Daphna Nachminovitch, who is based in Norfolk, in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The launch comes as some Virginia lawmakers push for greater transparency about animal welfare violations at testing facilities in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website compiles reports of violations discovered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), as well as reports by and about animal testing facilities to the National Institutes of Health Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. It includes information on the five public universities in Virginia that experiment on animals as part of their scientific and medical research: Eastern Virginia Medical School, Old Dominion University, University of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University and Virginia Tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While PETA has long pushed for a halt to animal experimentation, the issue has taken on heightened significance for Virginia legislators following federal agents’ May 2022 seizure of over 4,000 beagles from a Cumberland County breeding facility operated by global biotechnology company Envigo. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Ah5Wkol4Oy"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-pass-new-regulations-for-controversial-beagle-breeding-facility/">Virginia lawmakers pass new regulations for controversial beagle breeding facility</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia lawmakers pass new regulations for controversial beagle breeding facility&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-pass-new-regulations-for-controversial-beagle-breeding-facility/embed/#?secret=V7bm08kuMU#?secret=Ah5Wkol4Oy" data-secret="Ah5Wkol4Oy" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agents had over the prior nine months discovered dozens of violations of the Animal Welfare Act at the complex, where Envigo bred thousands of beagles for use in research. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PST_Inspection_Report_ENVIGO-RMS-LLC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspectors found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> piles of feces, urine, insects and uneaten food under kennel floors. Live ants were seen crawling in and out of dog feeders. More than 300 puppies had died due to “unknown causes” between January and July 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PETA had found similar abuses in its </span><a href="https://investigations.peta.org/dog-beagle-breeding-mill-envigo/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">own 2021 undercover investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, amid national headlines about the Cumberland facility, the Virginia General Assembly </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-pass-new-regulations-for-controversial-beagle-breeding-facility/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> adding further restrictions to Envigo’s operations and making research animals not actively involved in experiments subject to state rules for animal care imposed on commercial pet breeders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further efforts in 2023 to increase state oversight of research animals had more mixed results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, proposed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1230" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have required animal testing facilities to register with the state and impose civil penalties and other restrictions on those that racked up critical violations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately what this bill is trying to do is to reduce or eliminate these kinds of violations, especially when they harm the animals that are being tested,” he said during one hearing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, he argued, the state should have “explanations” of violations at state university labs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are institutions that carry our name: Virginia Tech, University of Virginia, VCU, Virginia Commonwealth University,” he said. “So I think that we as the government that also subsidizes them in many ways, gives them monies, need to have explanations on exactly what is the root cause of these violations, how is it happening, what steps are they taking to correct these.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several lawmakers, however, expressed reluctance to back a bill that lacked support from Virginia’s higher education institutions, and the proposal was ultimately tabled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other bills would have ordered facilities to submit annual reports to the state on how many animals they use, the percentage of their funds that are spent on research involving animals and a plan for reducing their use of animals over the next 10 years. While the reports would not have been posted publicly on a state website, they would have been subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, said Senate patron Jennifer Boysko, D-Loudoun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t know exactly in Virginia who’s testing on animals and what the scope is,” she said during a January committee hearing. “And so this is an attempt to start to monitor and identify so that we are keeping our own records.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the federal Animal Welfare Act, facilities that conduct animal testing must already submit reports to the USDA on what they used in experiments. But many animal welfare organizations argue those figures give an inaccurate picture of the impacts of testing because the act </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK24650/#:~:text=Main%20Points-,Animal%20Welfare%20Act,%2C%20dealers%2C%20breeders%2C%20etc." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">does not cover some of the most common species</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> used in experiments: mice, rats and birds. The Virginia proposal would have included data on all research animals, not just those covered by the Animal Welfare Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The case we’re making is there are a number of animals that are being experimented on in Virginia that do not fall under the coverage of that act,” said Del. Irene Shin, D-Fairfax, who carried a version of the bill in the House. “So we have no idea or data or reporting requirements on what count of those animals are here in the commonwealth.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PETA has estimated that the 7,252 animals reported to the USDA as being used in Virginia testing facilities in 2021 are roughly 5% of the animals actually being used in research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Boysko’s version of the bill passed both chambers in different forms, it was revised substantially during negotiations between the House and Senate about how to harmonize it with a different proposal from Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+CHAP0532" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">final legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only requires animal testing facilities to display a link to their annual USDA report as well as any other inspection reports. Any facility operated by a higher education institution that receives a critical citation for violating federal animal welfare rules must notify the school’s leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shin </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/03/06/animal-welfare-advocates-disappointed-with-watered-down-testing-transparency-bill/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told The Virginian-Pilot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this spring that higher education groups had heavily lobbied against other provisions of Boysko’s legislation. And in committee hearings, some lawmakers expressed concern that requiring public schools to report the percentage of their funding that they spent on animal research would be too burdensome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve got to quantify that out, separate that out, and my broader question then is: As to what purpose?” Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Spotsylvania, asked this January. “What is that going to tell you when you get the number of animals they’re using in testing and where they’re getting them from? To me it begs the question: What’s it going to tell us that’s going to result in making sure that animals are treated humanely and only testing goes on that needs to be done?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email to the Mercury, Nachminovitch said lawmakers are “unaware of the multitude and/or severity of federal animal welfare violations at laboratories, even those funded by Virginians” but the group expects other bills on the issue to be proposed during the upcoming General Assembly session.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PETA website intends to make those violations easily accessible to the public, she said. But, she continued, “so much information is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> publicly available, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e.g., the number of animals not covered by the federal Animal Welfare Act, the breakdown of tax dollars dedicated to animal experiments versus non-animal methods, and more.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Corrections said that while no crimes involving convicted sex offenders and minor victims were reported on Halloween, probation and parole officers requested eight warrants for probation violations and arrested five people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We would like to report zero violations on Halloween, but these warrants and arrests demonstrate the Virginia Department of Corrections’ steadfast commitment to protecting all Virginians,” said agency Director Chad Dotson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because so many children are out and about on Halloween, knocking on the doors of neighbors known and unknown, Virginia probation and parole officers as well as state and local law enforcement take extra steps to ensure convicted sex offenders under community supervision have no contact with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex offenders under supervision are instructed not to decorate their homes, hand out candy or attend community gatherings, while probation and parole districts set curfews and conduct random home checks and other surveillance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is not alone in its approach to Halloween: </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/30/us/halloween-sex-offenders-cec/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that California conducts home checks on Halloween and sets a 5 p.m. curfew for sex offenders under community supervision. One Georgia county has taken the approach of collecting all local sex offenders in one location on Halloween night to hear talks from speakers, including parole officers. Others require offenders to post signs outside warning trick-or-treaters away. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1220596.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reverses an earlier decision by the Virginia Court of Appeals that found the state’s Department of Medical Assistance Services, the agency that administers Virginia’s Medicaid program, could not be reimbursed the more than $22,000 it paid to cover the victim’s medical costs because DMAS was itself not a victim of the crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That crime occurred in the fall of 2019 outside the home of Patrick County resident Justin Hawks. Larry Puckett, who court filings say had known Hawks for about 10 years, had been staying on the property as a guest but was asked to leave by Hawks after “he proved to be an unpleasant guest.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Puckett initially left Hawks’ property, he later returned several times, culminating in a physical altercation. Eventually, court filings report, as Hawks was returning home, Puckett ran up behind him and jumped on his back. Hawks told Puckett, “I’m not going to fight you,” and Puckett responded, “I’m not fighting you. I’m killing you, m&#8212;&#8211;f&#8212;&#8211;,” before stabbing Hawks multiple times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puckett, however, had not killed Hawks, who ran to the nearest house and was brought to the hospital. There, he was treated for multiple stab wounds to his chest and arm at a cost of almost $120,000. Because he was unable to pay for the costs of his medical care, Medicaid stepped in and paid a negotiated lesser amount of $22,691. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Puckett was convicted by Patrick Circuit Court of malicious wounding. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, with eight years suspended, and ordered to complete five years of probation and pay DMAS the cost of the medical services as restitution. The restitution was to be paid in $50 increments each month following his release from prison. The appeals court later noted that Puckett’s attorney had called the requirement “an exercise in futility,” and that Puckett’s “last request for legal assistance showed no assets and listed his address as ‘homeless.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1002213.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Court of Appeals concluded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Puckett couldn’t be ordered to pay DMAS restitution because “it was not established that these medical expenses were ‘incurred by the victim’ of Puckett’s malicious wounding.” The appeals court based its conclusion on a definition of “incurred” drawn from a state Medicaid regulation about what the program could cover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia rejected that argument, saying it didn’t consider the Medicaid regulation relevant and noting that the state’s restitution law “does not say that the restitution must be paid </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the victim. It only requires that the expense be ‘incurred by the victim.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Medicaid paid for the medical costs rather than Hawks himself doesn’t change the situation, Judge D. Arthur Kelsey wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An incurred medical expense does not become unincurred simply because a medical provider waives its right to seek full payment from an indigent individual in hopes of recovering partial payment from a solvent entity, such as a private or public insurer” like Medicaid, Kelsey concluded. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a case involving a Chesapeake carport, the Virginia Court of Appeals ruled that zoning violation notices issued by a local government must clearly state that the property owner’s failure to contest the violation within 30 days means the decision is legally “final and unappealable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without the finality language, a property owner might logically conclude that the failure to appeal to the [board of zoning appeals] within 30 days would foreclose an appeal in that forum, but that they could later appeal to a court,” </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1692221.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Daniel E. Ortiz wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case stems from a freestanding carport built without a permit on a residential property in Chesapeake almost two decades ago. In 2020, two years after new owner Donald Calway bought the property, a city code compliance inspector issued him a notice of violation and ordered him to fix it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the appeals court, fine print at the bottom of the original notice informed Calway he could contest the violation to the board of zoning appeals within 30 days “but did not mention that failure to appeal would make the decision final and unappealable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals found the omission of that statement made the notice “defective” and therefore made a later penalty unenforceable because </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title15.2/chapter22/section15.2-2311/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires that any notice of violation “include a statement informing the recipient … that the decision shall be final and unappealable if not appealed within 30 days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the city of Chesapeake argued it had satisfied the requirements of the law by including a statement that additional information could be found on the city’s website, the judges rejected that argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The statute places the burden on the zoning administrator to clearly delineate the appeal rights of property owners,” Ortiz wrote, adding: “Each [notice of violation] must describe both (1) the right to appeal within 30 days </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(2) the finality of the decision after 30 days if not appealed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeals court noted that its ruling is in line with a </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2008/08-025-Cole.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2008 advisory opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from then-Attorney General Bob McDonnell that a notice of violation “must include a statement informing the recipient … that the decision is final and unappealable if not so appealed in thirty days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the court left the door open for Chesapeake to continue pursuing enforcement actions against Calway. Because a later letter from the city zoning administrator declaring the carport illegal included all of the statements required under the law, the judges noted it “is potentially shielded from further attack in this or any future litigation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Koehler, the attorney representing Calway, said, “We’re holding our breath to see what the city does. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now we’re hoping that the city will simply allow him to keep” the carport, Koehler said, noting that other homes in the neighborhood have similar structures and that Calway and the prior owner had paid property taxes that included the value of the carport for over 15 years. “It’s simply a matter of fairness, I think, given that the structure has been there since 2004.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about whether the city intends to appeal the decision or pursue further enforcement actions, Chesapeake Director of Public Communications Heath E. Covey said in an email, “The city respectfully disagrees with this ruling and is currently evaluating next steps.”</span></p>

(Virginia Department of Forestry)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an unusually active fall fire season that has seen responders struggle to get multiple blazes under control, all of Virginia’s wildfires except for the Matt’s Creek Fire in Bedford County have been contained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Monday night, the state had “no active wildfires” besides Matt’s Creek, said Virginia Department of Forestry spokesman Greg Bilyeu in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s fall fire season runs from Oct. 15 to Nov. 30, a period when dead leaves provide ample fuel for any spark. This year has proved especially challenging, with the Department of Forestry responding to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">113 wildfires that have burned more than 12,000 acres since the season began. By comparison, the agency has said the average annual acreage affected by wildfires in Virginia is 9,500. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need no further proof that fall fire season has arrived with a vengeance,” said Chief of Fire and Emergency Response John Miller in a Nov. 16 statement. “We will remain vigilant to protect people </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and property.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the more serious conflagrations was the Quaker Run Fire in Madison County, which broke out Oct. 24 near the community of Syria and burned nearly 4,000 acres, including roughly 700 in Shenandoah National Park, before it was declared contained Nov. 17. In Buchanan County, the Rocklick Fire affected over 2,200 acres, while the Tuggles Gap fire in Patrick County and Rachel’s Chapel fire in Dickenson County both burned more than 1,000 acres each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Matt’s Creek fire remains the largest blaze of the season, having spread to over 11,000 acres. Midday Wednesday, Bilyeu said the fire was 57% contained. Located in the Jefferson National Forest, that fire is under federal jurisdiction, with a large-scale response being managed by the U.S. Forest Service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Significant rain across the commonwealth Tuesday helped dampen Matt’s Creek as well as other wildfires. The U.S. Forest Service reported an area in the fire’s range received 3.8 inches of rain yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did all this rain put the fire out?” the agency wrote in a Facebook update. “Not completely. But it helped! Firefighters continue to patrol and monitor the fire area and are working to put out the stumps and logs that are still smoldering.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bilyeu said Wednesday that “the rain was very important in helping weaken all fire activity and preventing flare ups and new starts.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has experienced drought conditions, so the rain was extremely welcome,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond Wednesday, Gov. Glenn Youngkin too expressed gratitude for Tuesday’s precipitation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I also want to stop for a minute and have a moment of appreciation, thanks and a big amen for the rain yesterday. It was a big moment. We needed it,” he said at the beginning of a traditional tribute ceremony involving Virginia’s Mattaponi and Pamunkey tribes. “It also allowed us to fully contain the forest fires and wildfires that have been burning across Virginia. So we’re just going to have a moment of silence for rain.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bilyeu said Virginians should continue to take extra care and check with local officials for the latest burn ban information before planning any outdoor fires.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turkey may be the symbol of Thanksgiving in the U.S., but in Virginia, the first sign of the holiday is usually two deer laid before the steps of the Executive Mansion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the 346th year, the Mattaponi and Pamunkey tribes presented the state’s governor with an annual tribute of game as part of a ceremony that dates back to treaties signed in 1646 and 1677. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is an honor to be here today to continue our government-to-government relationship with the commonwealth of Virginia and to continue this tradition that’s been going on for many, many years,” said Mattaponi Chief Mark Custalow Wednesday before presenting Gov. Glenn Youngkin with a seven-point buck shot on the tribe’s reservation in King William County. The other deer, a six-point buck shot on Pamunkey lands, was presented by tribal Councilman Gordon Atkinson. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today the tax tribute is virtually unknown by many of the commonwealth’s 8.5 million residents outside of tribal members and state government workers. But those who know it view it as an important reminder of both the rights of Virginia’s tribes and the state’s obligations to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s ceremony holds immense significance as it reminds us of the strong ties between these tribes and the great commonwealth of Virginia,” said Secretary of the Commonwealth Kelly Gee. </span></p>
<p>Virginia tribes began paying tribute to the crown in lieu of taxes in 1646, when a treaty declared them &#8220;tributaries&#8221; of the king. The practice was continued in the 1677 Treaty of Middle Plantation, signed by Charles II and representatives of numerous Virginia tribes following <span style="font-weight: 400;">a spate of violence by colonists against Native peoples during Bacon’s Rebellion. That agreement also acknowledged particular land and hunting rights for the tribes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Treaty of Middle Plantation, said Youngkin Wednesday, “marked a significant milestone in our shared history.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It became a stepping stone for the enduring relationship, a relationship that is underscored by the basic principles of unity, peace and deep respect,” he said. “Today we honor the ways that the Mattaponi and the Pamunkey tribes have shaped the foundation and inspired the spirit of Virginia and the spirit of our nation.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The early tribute required of the tribes was </span><a href="https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/dbva/items/show/61" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 beaver skins &#8220;att the goeing away of Geese</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” but tribes have presented the governor with a range of payments over the years. In 1982, for example, the Mattaponi offered then-Gov. Chuck Robb six quail and a wild turkey, while the Pamunkey extended a buck and a wild turkey. Today, the typical tribute paid by each tribe the day before Thanksgiving is a deer, whose meat is then distributed to Virginians in need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Virginia’s tribes were some of the earliest to encounter European colonists, they have faced an unusually difficult road to federal recognition, the legal acceptance of a tribe as a sovereign nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That difficulty is in large part due to the state’s decision beginning in the 1920s to officially classify all residents as either white or legally Black. This choice — sometimes called a “paper genocide” — erased nearly all of the documentary evidence needed by the tribes to prove their ongoing lineage to the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t until 2015 that the first Virginia tribe — the Pamunkey — gained federal recognition. Six more tribes followed after Congress passed a law recognizing them in 2018. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s next General Assembly won’t convene until Jan. 10, but senators and delegates have already begun penning legislation. (And by that, we mean the Virginia Division of Legislative Services is hard at work translating their goals into the high-flown tones of state code.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the start of the 2024 session’s official prefiling period, lawmakers dropped the first bills that will be up for consideration this January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much more is yet to come as Democrats and Republicans jockey for ways to realize their key priorities on everything from hot-button issues like abortion access to the more bread-and-butter legislation that ensures state laws and agencies remain abreast of an ever-changing world. Democrats will have control of both the House of Delegates and Senate when lawmakers return to Richmond, but the slimness of their majorities means they aren’t guaranteed to get everything they want. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s what was proposed on the first day bills could be filed: </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Constitutional amendments on abortion</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two bills — </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HJ1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Joint Resolution 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SJ1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Joint Resolution 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from multiple female Democratic senators — would start the process of amending the state Constitution to declare that “every individual has the fundamental right to reproductive freedom” and that the right should not be denied or infringed upon “unless justified by a compelling state interest and achieved by the least restrictive means that do not infringe an individual’s autonomous decision-making.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No single bill has the power to change the state Constitution. Amendments require that a resolution be passed by a majority of both houses during a session and then held over to be passed again by the next elected legislature, with an election intervening between the two approvals. If it succeeds the second time, voters must approve the change in a referendum before it takes effect. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Constitutional amendment on felon voting rights</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two bills — </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HJ2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Joint Resolution 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SJ2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Joint Resolution 2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton — would begin the process of amending the Constitution to restore voting rights to felons who have served their time. Currently, Virginia is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/us/virginia-youngkin-voting-former-felons.html" target="_blank">the only state in the U.S.</a> that strips voting rights from all felons for their entire life, with restoration only possible if they petition the governor and the governor decides to grant their request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A person who has been convicted of a felony shall not be entitled to vote during any period of incarceration for such felony conviction, but upon release from incarceration for that felony conviction and without further action required of him, such person shall be invested with all political rights, including the right to vote,” the amendment states. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Constitutional amendment on property tax exemption for surviving spouses of a soldier who died in the line of duty</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly previously passed a potential constitutional amendment that would extend the property tax exemption that’s currently available to the spouses of soldiers killed in action to spouses of soldiers who died in the line of duty. This year, Del. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, has proposed a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SJ3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second vote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the amendment, as well as </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would authorize the required referendum on the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Increases to the state minimum wage</h4>

	</strong></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="u4AtJ77jZf"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-12/">Virginia lawmakers vote to raise the minimum wage to $12 over three years</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia lawmakers vote to raise the minimum wage to $12 over three years&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-12/embed/#?secret=ijr8WstuHg#?secret=u4AtJ77jZf" data-secret="u4AtJ77jZf" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the Virginia General Assembly under Democratic control voted to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-vote-to-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-12/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gradually raise the state minimum wage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from $7.25 an hour to $12 an hour over the course of three years. That legislation also provided for further increases of the minimum to $13.50 in 2025 and $15 in 2026 if the General Assembly again voted to approve them by July 1, 2024. If those increases didn’t get a second green light, the bill ordered that the minimum wage be pegged to inflation going forward. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Jeion Ward, D-Hampton, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, would restart the increases on the same schedule laid out in 2020.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Assault weapons ban</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills from Del. Dan Helmer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Fairfax, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Creigh Deeds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Charlottesville, would make it a Class 1 misdemeanor for anyone to import, sell, manufacture, purchase, possess, transport or transfer an assault firearm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, the bill includes exceptions for any firearm that is antique, permanently inoperable, manually operated by bolt, pump, lever or slide action or manufactured before July 1, 2024.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Repealing Virginia’s Clean Cars law</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Tony Wilt, R-Rockingham, and Sen. Richard Stuart, R-Westmoreland, have put forward bills to repeal a 2021 Democrat-backed law that tied Virginia’s vehicle emissions standards to California’s rather than following the federal government’s less strict limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the Clean Air Act, states are prohibited from setting their own vehicle emissions standards and must choose between the federal and California limits. Since Virginia adopted the California standards, the Golden State has decided to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars beginning in 2035, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/26/californias-2035-ban-on-new-gas-powered-cars-set-to-apply-to-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a choice that Virginia will also be bound to follow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Stuart would simply repeal the 2021 law. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Wilt would go a step further, forbidding the State Air Pollution Control Board from adopting or enforcing any model year standards related to controlling emissions from new vehicles and prohibiting the state from requiring any new car “to be certified as compliant with model year standards related to the control of emissions adopted by California.” </span></p>

<p>“There is overwhelming evidence suggesting that the General Services Administration (GSA) administered a site selection process fouled by political considerations and alleged impropriety — one that was repeatedly curated to arrive at a predetermined outcome,” <a class="c-link" href="https://connolly.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2023.11.15_joint_letter_to_gsa_oig_fbi_hq.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://connolly.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2023.11.15_joint_letter_to_gsa_oig_fbi_hq.pdf" data-sk="tooltip_parent">the Nov. 15 letter</a> said.</p>
<p>The request followed the announcement last week that the FBI’s new headquarters will be located in Greenbelt, Maryland, rather than in Landover, Maryland, or Springfield, Virginia.</p>
<p>That decision, which was made by the GSA, has sparked <a class="c-link" href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/09/fbi-director-slams-selection-process-for-a-new-hq-in-maryland-while-lawmakers-squabble/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/09/fbi-director-slams-selection-process-for-a-new-hq-in-maryland-while-lawmakers-squabble/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">a furious backlash from Virginia’s members of Congress and Gov. Glenn Youngkin</a>, who have pointed to concerns raised by FBI Director Christopher Wray about “the fairness and transparency” of the selection process. In a letter to FBI staff about the Greenbelt choice shortly after it was publicized, Wray alleged that there may have been “a potential conflict of interest” involving a high-ranking GSA official who overrode an agency panel’s unanimous recommendation that the headquarters be located in Springfield.</p>
<p>“The FBI observed that, at times, outside information was inserted into the process in a manner which appeared to disproportionately favor Greenbelt, and the justifications for the departures from the panel were varied and inconsistent,” Wray wrote. “Moreover, with one immaterial exception, each of the senior executive’s deviations from the unanimous panel either benefited the Greenbelt site or disfavored the Springfield site.”</p>
<p>While Wray did not name the official in his letter, documents released by the GSA last Thursday identified the individual as Nina Albert, the agency’s former commissioner of public buildings and a prior employee of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which owns the Greenbelt site.</p>
<p>Virginia’s congressional delegation draws heavily on Wray’s account in its request for an investigation into what the signatories describe as “a fatally flawed procurement.”</p>
<p>“In defending the indefensible, GSA has decided to proceed with the selection of Greenbelt over the objections of its client agency, the FBI,” wrote the group, which included Virginia Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, Democratic Reps. Gerry Connolly, Bobby Scott, Don Beyer, Abigail Spanberger, Jennifer Wexton and Jennifer McClellan, and Republican Reps. Rob Wittman, Jen Kiggans and Morgan Griffith.</p>

Instead, we ought to be SCRUTINIZING the money spent by a compromised FBI that targets conservatives, parents, &amp; faith groups.”</p>
<p>Plans for the FBI to move out of its aging and decrepit headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C. have been underway for almost two decades, with Virginia and Maryland competing against each other to secure the prize.</p>
<p>At a hearing held by the U.S. House Oversight and Accountability Committee Tuesday, GSA’s administrator and Maryland representatives <a class="c-link" href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/15/maryland-virginia-lawmakers-tussle-over-fbi-hq-decision-at-congressional-hearing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/15/maryland-virginia-lawmakers-tussle-over-fbi-hq-decision-at-congressional-hearing/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">defended the Greenbelt choice</a>, saying there was no merit to the conflict of interest claim and that Greenbelt would present the least cost to taxpayers.</p>
<p>“I am proud of the work that our team did,” said GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan. “This was inevitable that someone was going to be disappointed, between two states that were working very hard to land this facility.”</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday was a tough night for Churchill Downs in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multistate gaming and horse-racing company, best known for its ownership of the Churchill Downs racetrack where the Kentucky Derby is held, put millions of dollars this campaign season toward getting voters to back two ballot measures that would further expand its gambling operations in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If successful, one referendum would have allowed horse racing-themed slot machines in the city of Manassas Park, permission Churchill Downs needed to open its eighth Rosie’s Gaming Emporium in Virginia. Another would have approved the construction of a Richmond casino that would have been jointly owned by the company and media conglomerate Urban One. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In support of those measures, Churchill Downs funneled over $5.7 million into Virginia campaigns. Most of that, $5.1 million, went to the Richmond Wins, Vote Yes PAC pushing for the Richmond casino, which city voters had rejected in a referendum two years ago. An additional $518,000 went to the Manassas Park efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve put a lot of time, effort, blood, sweat, and tears to winning the Richmond referendum because we believe that&#8217;s a huge market for brick and mortar gaming,” Churchill Downs Incorporated CEO Bill Carstanjen </span><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4643985-churchill-downs-incorporated-chdn-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told investors on an Oct. 25 call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0v24goIbwj"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/">Home</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Home&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/embed/#?secret=DHuu5NBEoU#?secret=0v24goIbwj" data-secret="0v24goIbwj" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on Tuesday, voters decisively defeated both measures. Almost 59% of Manassas Park voters rejected the Rosie’s referendum, while almost 62% of Richmond voters nixed the casino project — a stark contrast to the 51%-49% split on the casino in 2021 when Urban One was the plan’s sole backer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Alexandria, who is serving as vice chair of a subcommittee reviewing the state’s gambling regulations, said the votes could indicate Virginians are ready to slow down the rapid expansion of gambling that’s taken place over the last four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I feel that we need to put a pause on expansion,” said Krizek. “And one of the reasons we need to do it is we don’t have a regulatory body that handles all of gambling yet.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churchill Downs, which also owns Virginia&#8217;s Colonial Downs racetrack in New Kent County, didn’t respond to several requests for comment for this story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek and the gambling subcommittee’s chair, Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Fredericksburg, are planning to propose a bill this winter that would require a three-year waiting period if a casino is put on the ballot and a locality’s voters reject it. The pair said the change would bring Virginia’s casino rules in line with </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/59.1-391/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> governing referenda on horse racing machines like those considered in Manassas Park. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know of any referendums that don’t have language in there that don’t put a limit on how many times” they can occur, said Krizek. “It’s unfair to voters to keep coming back to the well every single year after year until you win.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reeves also said he thought it would be “prudent” to enforce a hiatus on bringing casino proposals to voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, “the voters didn’t want it, but somehow they put it back up there,” he said. “Are you going to do that every year until they finally succumb to the will of the casinos? I don’t think that’s right. And I think when the voters speak as they have in this election, they need to honor that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia tightly limited the forms of gambling residents could engage in for years, the General Assembly in 2018 began to loosen its restrictions, allowing historical horse racing machines and two years later legalizing online sports betting and the construction of casinos in five cities, including Richmond, if voters endorsed them in a referendum. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Krizek called the casino law’s lack of a time limit for those referenda “an oversight.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think anybody anticipated that a locality would say no to it,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An initial 650-acre containment line was not completed before the fire advanced beyond its limits early last week. While firefighters went on to construct a larger 1,250-acre perimeter, the blaze broke through it Thursday and then on Saturday breached a 1,600-acre line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Bilyeu, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Forestry, said Monday that “due to the rocky terrain, it’s often more difficult to find workable areas to create those lines.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wind is one common factor that can cause wildfires to jump fire lines,” he wrote in an email. “Once this occurs, firefighters have to establish a new fire line, in a new location (hence the growing containment figures.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current containment line encompasses 2,800 acres of both private and public lands. About 670 of those acres are within the boundaries of Shenandoah National Park. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, the National Park Service </span><a href="https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/quaker-run-fire-information.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued a hiking advisory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Whiteoak Canyon and Old Rag trails, stating that they “are open but at times are impacted by dense smoke which may reach UNHEALTHY to VERY UNHEALTHY levels.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the wildfire has burned roughly 2,800 acres since it began, although firefighters have extinguished some areas. The Virginia Department of Forestry has not yet confirmed the fire’s cause. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia wildfires aren’t on the scale of those that have devastated California and Oregon in recent years, state forestry officials estimate there are approximately 700 wildfires in the commonwealth every year that affect just under 9,500 acres on average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s fall fire season, one of two times during the year when wildfire risk is considered to be hightest, runs from Oct. 15 to Nov. 30. During this period, fallen leaves and dead vegetation provide abundant fuel for flames, and wind and variably warm temperatures encourage the spread of fires that ignite. Drought and near-drought conditions through parts of Virginia this year have also increased risks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Forestry urges Virginians to be extra careful when lighting fires through the end of November, noting that more than 75% of the state’s wildfires are caused by humans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the precautions the agency recommends: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid burning on dry, windy days </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your burn pile small </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a rake or shovel and water hose on hand </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a phone ready to call 911 if a fire escapes your control </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stay with your fire until it’s completely out (drown, stir, ensure it’s cool) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider a “green” alternative to burning yard debris: compost your organic yard waste for your garden or yard </span></li>
</ul>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio entrepreneur Cathy Hughes may have upended her push to build a casino in Richmond by letting her opinions fly on the radio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just days before Richmonders head to the polls to vote a second time on a proposed casino partly owned by Urban One, the media company Hughes founded, casino opponents published a series of audio clips revealing racially inflammatory remarks made by Hughes and other Black casino proponents on local radio programs geared toward Black audiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clips include numerous examples of Hughes implying that opposition to the casino is driven by racism. At one point, she says, “Do not forget that they do not see you as a human being.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even though you may have a house like theirs, a car like theirs, your children may go to the same schools — they see you as a n*****, alright?” Hughes said. “Wake up!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a different recording, local radio personality and occasional political candidate Preston Brown took aim at Richmond activist Paul Goldman, a Jewish lawyer and former aide to Gov. Doug Wilder who has been fighting to block the casino.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s a white Jew with a background of Judas,” Brown said, referring to the biblical figure who betrayed Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, who supports the casino and has </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2021-11-01/critics-question-urban-ones-financial-links-to-pro-casino-elected-officials-and" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">received political contributions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from donors tied to the project, denounced the Goldman remark in a social media post Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I unequivocally condemn the antisemitic remarks made by a guest host on The Box 99.5 FM regarding Paul Goldman,” Stoney </span><a href="https://x.com/LevarStoney/status/1720433255680299049?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We must call out hate in all of its forms, and his remarks are completely unacceptable.”</span></p>
<p>https://twitter.com/LevarStoney/status/1720433255680299049?s=20</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney did not mention any of the other controversial remarks made by Hughes and others, and his office refused to comment further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement Friday afternoon, Goldman, a former chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, suggested the response and limited apology overlooked “the true meaning of the damage they have done to Richmond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For the love of money, for personal gain, they are willing to turn their casino project into a wedge of division, to attempt to win by a divisive strategy serving only their selfish interests,” Goldman said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audio clips, taken from multiple radio shows, were posted on the website of the No Means No anti-casino group. It’s unclear exactly when each comment was made, and the clips don’t show the full context of what preceded and came after each remark. Radio One, the station that aired Brown’s comments, did not immediately respond to a request for the full recordings of the shows from which the clips were taken. At least one of the clips posted by the anti-casino group was edited to condense multiple comments, according to a longer audio file of Brown’s remarks obtained by the Virginia Mercury. However, no one has come forward to dispute the accuracy of what the anti-casino group published.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio One, the station that aired Brown’s comment, issued a statement saying Brown was acting as a “temporary guest host” and is not employed by the station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These remarks were horrible and offensive,” said Marsha Landess, the station’s regional vice president. “Once we heard the comments and because he was alone in the studio with his producer, I personally drove to the station and immediately removed him from the show.  He will not be appearing again. Our CEO, Alfred Liggins, has personally apologized to Mr. Goldman on behalf of the station and our company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liggins is the son of Hughes. Efforts to reach Brown Friday were unsuccessful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Landess confirmed that the “primary voices” heard on most of the clips were Hughes and radio host Gary Flowers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Wins Vote Yes, the pro-casino PAC funded by Urban One and its business partner Churchill Downs, also distanced itself from the remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Richmond Wins Vote Yes is about bringing people together to build a better Richmond and provide meaningful economic opportunity for the city and its people,” the PAC said. “This campaign unequivocally condemns the anti-Semitic language and divisive comments that were made on the air.”</span></p>
<p>Rae Cousins, a Democrat who is running unopposed this November to represent House District 79 where the casino would be located, said in an email that &#8220;in reviewing all of the radio snippets that have been released, I absolutely condemn these statements and adamantly stand against all forms of discrimination, hatred and divisiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter where people stand on this or any political issue, we must agree that these kind of attacks have no place in our community,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shots at Kaine’s family life</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recordings also include sharp criticism by Hughes, Brown and Flowers of Tim Kaine, one of Virginia’s two U.S. senators and previously state governor, mayor of Richmond and a member of the city council. In one clip where Hughes and others discuss the removal of Confederate monuments from Richmond in 2020, the Urban One head said, “Tim Kaine might have wanted one on his front yard.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/senator-kaine-votes-no-to-one-casino-as-richmond-residents-gear-up-for-election-day/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted against the casino in the 2021 referendum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a decision Hughes appears to have been referencing when she referred to the “damage that he had done.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He knows the pain of the Black people of the Southside of Richmond. And yet … he&#8217;s saying that it is better for a Black man to get drunk off some beer that he financed, some craft beer in a local brewery, than to have a job. How do you equate that?” she asked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That comment appears to be in reference to a criticism levied by Brown against the former governor in the longer version of his remarks obtained by the Mercury. In the extended remarks, Brown castigated Kaine for selling beer and wine at a church fundraiser this summer, saying, “He don’t want you to gamble, but he want to sell beer and wine, and it’s OK. You see why I say some people talk out of both sides of their face?”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In yet another clip, Brown noted Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, had </span><a href="https://richmondfreepress.com/news/2021/oct/14/kaine-holton-household-split-casino/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disagreed on the casino issue in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with Holton voting in favor of the proposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Bible said, ‘When two come together and agree,’” he said. “Now how can those two live in the same household and not agree? So how can we have him representing us as a senator when he can’t even keep his own home together?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about the remarks, Katie Stuntz, a spokesperson for Kaine, said Friday that the senator “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is attending a friend’s funeral and is unavailable for comment.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia is new to the casino business</h4>

	 </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s four other cities allowed to have casinos — Bristol, Danville, Portsmouth and Norfolk — have approved them without much drama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a different story in Richmond, where the proposed casino has occasionally inflamed longstanding racial fault lines.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="QfNM6u4Xb5"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/29/fifth-virginia-casino-could-be-in-the-cards-but-richmond-voters-still-divided/">Fifth Virginia casino could be in the cards, but Richmond voters still divided</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Fifth Virginia casino could be in the cards, but Richmond voters still divided&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/29/fifth-virginia-casino-could-be-in-the-cards-but-richmond-voters-still-divided/embed/#?secret=tCYkIfaaZo#?secret=QfNM6u4Xb5" data-secret="QfNM6u4Xb5" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the casino legalization bill was </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/05/after-gambling-interests-strike-a-deal-in-private-push-begins-for-casino-legalization-bill/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being discussed in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some Black lawmakers in the General Assembly said they wanted at least some Black ownership of casinos in the industry rather than having Black people simply work in them. Urban One, which describes itself as “the largest local urban radio network” and a “leading voice speaking to Black America,” seemed to fit the bill when the company expressed interest in building a casino in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the project emerged in early 2021, it was described as America’s first and only Black-owned casino and pitched as a way to uplift South Richmond, an area in need of revitalization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state capital is overwhelmingly liberal and has had mostly Black political leadership for decades, but stark divides have persisted between the city’s wealthier, whiter areas and working-class Black neighborhoods that often feel left out of the city’s economic development efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Richmond voters rejected the first casino referendum two years ago, the lower-income minority neighborhoods closest to where the proposed casino would be built strongly supported the project. But opposition was high enough elsewhere in the city that it went down in defeat, sparking some criticism that white Richmond had scuttled a project Black Richmond wanted. Meanwhile, progressive activists who oppose the casino see themselves as fighting predatory gambling interests that drain money from the communities they seek to enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed Richmond Grand Resort  and Casino on the ballot this year promises to create 1,300 jobs and generate $30 million in annual tax revenue. The “Black-owned” marketing has been largely dropped this year because Urban One is now pursuing the casino as a joint project with Churchill Downs, the horse racing and gambling enterprise that bought Virginia’s Colonial Downs racetrack last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote on this year’s casino referendum is expected to be close, but it wasn’t immediately clear Friday what impact the disclosure of the audio clips might have on the vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Hughes in one recording released by casino opponents insisted the issue “is not about the color of a person’s skin,” other clips reveal her repeatedly casting the casino debate in racial terms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one clip, she </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">characterizes Black opponents of the casino and Black supporters as, respectively, &#8220;house n****** and field n******.&#8221; In another, she says, “We have got to connect our Black middle class with our Black downtrodden and realize that we are one and the same in the eyes of white folks. White folks do not care.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hughes and Flowers specifically called out two casino opponents, marijuana legalization and civil rights advocate Chelsea Higgs Wise and former City Council candidate Allan-Charles Chipman, in one segment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are not white folk pulling up signs and flying planes around the city,” said Flowers. “They’re paying for it, but they’ve hired Black people to do that — self-hating Black people.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chipman </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MrLegacyJones/status/1720448146981949583" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hit back on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the recordings were circulated, writing, “I am not a self-hating Black person as they called me. I am an exploitation-hating Black man that firmly believes Dr. King is right when he said ‘Racism, economic exploitation, and militarism are all tied together. You can’t get rid of one without getting rid of the other.’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Nov. 7 looming, the clips make it clear that even the casino’s backers are unsure of what will happen Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I spent $10 million is what the final bill looks like to keep it in Richmond. Such a waste. I am so mad at this opposition,” said Hughes in one recording. “Do you know how much good I could have done with $10 million that I had to pay to lawyers and accountants and lobbyists and make contributions to everybody I thought could influence?” </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A public-private initiative that aims to test out emerging energy technologies on Southwest Virginia lands formerly mined for coal has signed an agreement to develop its projects on 65,000 acres primarily located in Wise County that are owned by a major natural gas and pipeline company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal, announced by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s office Wednesday, will give the Energy DELTA Lab access to a large tract of formerly mined lands owned by Texas-based company Energy Transfer and managed by its subsidiary, Penn Virginia Operating Company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Short for Discovery, Education, Learning &amp; Technology Accelerator, the DELTA Lab has for several years <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/20/can-southwest-virginia-remake-itself-as-a-laboratory-for-renewables/" target="_blank">been a priority</a> for regional and state leaders eager to both keep a flourishing energy industry in Virginia’s coalfields and diversify an economy that for decades was dependent on coal. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crafted as a partnership between regional business development group InvestSWVA, the Virginia Department of Energy, the Southwest Virginia Energy Research and Development Authority and energy and utility companies, the DELTA Lab proposes to use the abundant lands and existing infrastructure of Southwest Virginia as test sites for new wind, solar, nuclear, battery and pumped storage, hydrogen and other emerging energy technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration said Wednesday that “more than a dozen projects” under consideration by the initiative represent over $8.25 billion in potential private investment, 1,650 new “high-paying” jobs and nearly a gigawatt of new power generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Repurposing former mined lands in Southwest Virginia for development will allow us to create sites where energy demand and generation can co-locate, leading to more opportunities to grow Virginia’s economy,” said Virginia Secretary of Commerce and Trade Caren Merrick in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wise County Administrator Mike Hatfield said in the same release that because large portions of Wise have been difficult to develop, “given limited access due to private and federal ownership,” the new agreement “will create game changing opportunities that simply did not exist before.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy Transfer, which owns both the surface and mineral rights of the land that will be used by DELTA Lab, </span><a href="https://www.energytransfer.com/blogpost/conservation-is-key-to-energy-transfers-natural-resources-operations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manages roughly 675,000 acres of land</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana and Virginia through Penn Virginia Operating Co. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tarah Kesterson, a spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Energy, said there is only one coal mining permit associated with the 65,000 acres, for A&amp;G Coal Corporation’s Lick Branch Mine. That operation is no longer actively mining, and the department is waiting for the bond to be released following cleanup, she said. </span></p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to correct the name of the mining permit associated with the 65,000 acres.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s off-year legislative races have long attracted national attention because poll watchers view them as a bellwether of how the electorate may lean in congressional and presidential contests. This year has an added layer of interest: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin has long flirted with the idea of a presidential run, and the outcome of the election will make it clear how viable his prospects are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With races tight in roughly a dozen disputed districts, </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2023/10/30/as-election-day-draws-near-virginia-candidates-attack-ads-are-getting-nastier/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaigning has turned unusually nasty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a state where politicians tend to pride themselves on their gentility. The latest campaign finance reports filed by candidates ahead of Nov. 7 show the parade of attack ads is being fueled by record amounts of cash — a situation made possible by Virginia’s lax laws, which put few limits on election fundraising or spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s four takeaways from the Oct. 30 reports, </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/money/raw-reports/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as published by the Virginia Public Access Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democrats outraised Republicans in the final election stretch, especially in the House, but both parties are throwing around enormous amounts of cash </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest figures from VPAP, which cover funds raised between Oct. 1 and Oct. 26, show Democrats outraising Republicans, particularly in the House, with thinner margins between the parties’ hauls in the Senate.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether, VPAP data on the Senate races shows Democrats took in $12.7 million to the GOP’s $10.6 million. For House campaigns, Democrats netted $14.2 million and Republicans $8.4 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While both chambers are in play this year, the Senate is seen as more crucial to both parties because it is currently the last bastion of Democratic control in state government. If Republicans can flip it, they will achieve the coveted trifecta of power; if Democrats can keep it, they can continue to block what they consider the most objectionable Republican proposals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the October fundraising is concentrated where you’d expect: in the big swing races. According to VPAP numbers, in the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/19/senate-district-31-race-republican-juan-pablo-segura-vs-democrat-russet-perry/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun- and Fauquier-based Senate District 31</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democrat Russet Perry took in almost $2.7 million, while Republican Juan Pablo Segura got $2.1 million. In </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/10/senate-district-16-race-democrat-vanvalkenburg-vs-republican-incumbent-dunnavant/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate District 16 in the Richmond suburbs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Democratic Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg raised $2.2 million to Republican Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant’s $1.9 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the House races, VPAP shows Democrats netted the seven highest fundraising amounts of the period, led by former Del. Josh Cole in </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/12/house-district-65-race-democrat-cole-vs-republican-peters/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Fredericksburg-area House District 65</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($2 million), Josh Thomas in </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/11/house-district-21-race-republican-stirrup-vs-democrat-thomas/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prince William County’s House District 21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($1.8 million) and Michael Feggans in the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/21/house-district-97-democrat-feggans-vs-incumbent-republican-greenhalgh/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Beach-based House District 97</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($1.4 million). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also notable: Money for Democratic House candidate Susanna Gibson has majorly slowed since the news that </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/09/11/susanna-gibson-sex-website-virginia-candidate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she performed sex acts online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> broke in early September. According to VPAP reports, Gibson only took in $211,000 between Oct. 1 and Oct. 26. She previously raised nearly $489,000</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> However, in the latest period she still outraised her Republican opponent, David Owen, who took in nearly $190,000 in October. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The amounts of money that have flowed into this year’s elections are huge</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year&#8217;s races could prove <a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/general-assembly-cash-and-amount-raised-oct-30/" target="_blank">to be Virginia’s most expensive yet</a>. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between Oct. 1 and Oct. 26, VPAP data shows General Assembly candidates </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/money/raw-reports/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised nearly $46 million</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">— $23.4 million for Senate races and $22.6 million for House races</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s on top of the summer and early fall fundraising hauls and the more than <a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/senate/candidates/primary/" target="_blank">$28 million spent on the June Senate primaries</a> and $8.5 million <a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/house/candidates/primary/" target="_blank">spent on the House primaries</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the money isn’t slowing. </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/updates/4681-large-pre-election-donations-20231031/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday alone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Virginia Senate Democratic Caucus gave $384,000 to Del. Clint Jenkins, who is fighting against Republican Del. Emily Brewer to represent </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/24/senate-district-17-race-democrat-jenkins-vs-republican-brewer/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Hampton Roads- and Southside-based Senate District 17</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. On the same day, Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC gave $675,000 to a handful of Republican candidates. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Two of the biggest donors are Youngkin&#8217;s PAC and Clean Virginia </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the right, VPAP shows that Youngkin’s Spirit of Virginia PAC is one of the biggest spenders of the period, routing $690,000 to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/19/senate-district-24-race-republican-diggs-vs-incumbent-democrat-mason/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">former Poquoson and York County Sheriff Danny Diggs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, $600,000 to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/20/senate-district-27-race-republican-durant-vs-democrat-griffin-vs-independent-gary/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Tara Durant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, $529,000 to Dunnavant, $300,000 to Segura, $265,000 to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/09/house-district-82-race-democrat-adams-vs-republican-incumbent-taylor/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Kim Taylor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and $250,000 to former Prince William County Supervisor </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/11/house-district-21-race-republican-stirrup-vs-democrat-thomas/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Stirrup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, among others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Virginia, the Charlottesville-based group founded by millionaire Michael Bills to counter Dominion Energy’s influence in the General Assembly, gave $200,000 each to Democrats Perry, VanValkenburg, Feggans, Thomas and Travis Nembhard, who is vying for Northern Virginia’s House District 22. The organization also doled out smaller donations to numerous other candidates, most of whom were Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Virginia and Dominion were the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/11/millions-funneled-into-virginia-primaries-reignite-calls-for-campaign-finance-reform/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two biggest spenders in this year’s primary elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, collectively contributing over $12 million to campaigns. Dominion’s PAC has continued to make large donations over the past month, mostly in the $10,000 to $75,000 range. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond’s casino referendum is also drawing big money </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to VPAP data, Urban One and Churchill Downs have raised over $9 million </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/29/fifth-virginia-casino-could-be-in-the-cards-but-richmond-voters-still-divided/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to convince Richmond voters they want the Richmond Grand Resort and Casino</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a 2021 referendum failed to get enough support for the proposal. If they can squeak out a win this cycle, Virginia will be on track to get its fifth casino after the General Assembly in 2020 passed a law allowing five cities to hold referenda on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The companies’ Richmond Wins, Vote Yes campaign took in almost $1.2 million this October, much of it in in-kind expenditures by Urban One and Churchill Downs that added to an initial investment of more than $8 million. Construction and trades groups also raised nearly $200,000 in support of the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anti-casino efforts, including the No Means No Casino campaign and the Richmond Anti-Corruption League, raised roughly $220,000 in opposition. </span></p>

(Courtesy of the Virginia Department of Forestry)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A wildfire that began a week ago on 20 acres in central Virginia’s Madison County has expanded to 425 acres near Shenandoah National Park and is expected to grow while firefighters construct a broader containment line to stop the blaze’s spread. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The objective is to burn out the fuel (leaves, fallen trees, branches, etc.) between the fire lines,” said Virginia Department of Forestry spokesperson Greg Bilyeu in an email. “While this approach results in a larger fire in the short term, implementing this strategy will help us achieve our objective of providing firefighter and public safety while protecting homes and other critical infrastructure.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, no structures have been damaged by what the agency is calling the Quaker Run Fire, after a nearby roadway. The forestry agency says the property is privately owned and lies near both the</span> Rapidan Wildlife Management Area and the <span class="il">Shenandoah</span> National Park.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bilyeu said officials haven’t figured out the cause of the conflagration yet. While an investigation is underway, he said the department’s first priority is managing and halting the fire. As of Monday afternoon, the Department of Forestry estimated it was 35% contained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firefighters are in the process of digging a containment line — a perimeter that deprives a fire of any fuel source, stopping it from progressing any farther — around 650 acres surrounding the wildfire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This fire will quickly run out of fuel when it reaches the firelines crews are creating that will prevent its progress past the 650-acre containment area,” said VDOF Chief of Fire and Emergency Response John Miller in a release issued Saturday, when the fire had expanded to cover 390 acres. “As long as weather conditions don’t shift, we anticipate this fire will be fully contained within the next few days.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the </span><a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?VA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Drought Monitor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> operated by the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Madison County is currently experiencing abnormal dryness and, in the western part of the county, severe drought. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dry conditions, lower humidity and higher winds definitely assist conditions for wildfires,” Bilyeu said. However, he continued, “the terrain in this location is the main challenge.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Forestry has described the area where the fire is burning as both “steep and difficult to access.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bilyeu said the Quaker Run Fire, occurring during Virginia’s fall fire season, is “somewhat average for this time of year” because of the availability of dead leaves and dry grasses and the tendency of people to burn yard debris in the fall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he emphasized that officials have not yet determined the cause of the blaze, he noted that “escaped burning debris is the leading cause of wildfires in Virginia.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With a few precautions, folks can dramatically reduce the chances of a fire escaping their control,” he said. “Also &#8212; before burning, everyone should make sure to check with local officials for burning-related ordinances or burn bans.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, the Rocky Mount Fire in Shenandoah National Park burned more than 10,000 acres, becoming what officials called the second-largest fire in park history. And in 2011, a lightning strike ignited a fire in Great Dismal Swamp in southern Virginia </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2011/11/23/officials-declare-dismal-swamp-fire-out-after-111-days/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that burned for 111 days.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As of Monday, the Virginia Department of Forestry’s </span><a href="https://virginiapublic.firesponse.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public fire response map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> listed several other blazes around the state, including a 100-acre fire on Parrott River Road in Pulaski County and another 100-acre fire in Buchanan County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Forestry reports that every year, the state sees an average of 700 fires affecting just under 9,500 acres.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Each year in Virginia, more than 60 homes and other structures are damaged or destroyed by wildland fire, although agency suppression efforts are credited with directly protecting more than 460 homes and 280 other structures, collectively worth more than 60 million dollars,” the </span><a href="https://dof.virginia.gov/wildland-prescribed-fire/learn-about-wildland-and-prescribed-fire/wildfire-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">department states on its website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s </span><a href="https://dof.virginia.gov/glossary/fire-season/#:~:text=The%20time%20of%20year%20during,October%2015%20to%20November%2030." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fall fire season</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of two times of the year when the risk of fire is highest, runs from Oct. 15 to Nov. 30. During this period, fallen leaves and dead vegetation provide fuel for flames, while winds and variably warm temperatures can help them spread. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winchester resident Andrew Hahn agreed to plead guilty to five counts of embezzlement and one count of money laundering. Investigators found that he embezzled more than $890,000 by creating false invoices for computer purchases from a company he owned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Harrisonburg police, the Harrisonburg-Rockingham Community Services Board notified law enforcement of its suspicions of embezzlement in October 2021 after an internal investigation and external financial audit. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://vacsb.org/community-services-boards-and-the-behavioral-authority-csbs-and-the-bha/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community services boards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are Virginia’s primary providers of behavioral health and developmental disability services at the local level. They are funded through the state budget and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/14/youngkin-signs-virginia-budget-offering-tax-reductions-major-new-spending/" target="_blank">have been a focus of Virginia lawmakers in recent years</a> as the state struggles to shore up its beleaguered behavioral health system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police said Hahn, who as IT manager had the power to award technology-related contracts, awarded those contracts to his company for products and services that were either never provided to the board or were provided at inflated prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hahn used his position to his advantage and went to great lengths to conceal his actions from the HRCSB,” Harrisonburg police said at the time of the arrest. “The investigation revealed that the employer followed common and standard business practices, including internal and external audits, but Hahn found a way to circumvent these safeguards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The office of Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, which was involved in investigating the case through its financial crimes team, said over $720,000 of the money Hahn embezzled was used for his personal expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockingham County Circuit Court sentenced Hahn to 20 years of prison on each embezzlement count, with 17 years of each sentence suspended. He was also sentenced to 40 years in prison on the money laundering charge, with all of the time suspended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to imprisonment, the court ordered Hahn to pay almost $190,000 in restitution. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals is allowing a legal malpractice suit to go forward in a case brought by a Rockingham County man who served almost nine years in prison for his involvement in the 2012 theft of sandwiches and two cases of beer from a grocery store in Harrisonburg. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1079223.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, handed down Tuesday, sends the case back to Rockingham Circuit Court for further arguments about whether Mark O’Hara Wright is entitled to damages from defense attorney Andrew Graves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the Richmond-based U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals </span><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca4/19-7447/19-7447-2021-06-21.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered Wright’s early release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, concluding that “had Wright’s trial counsel been adequately informed, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of his trial would have been different.” That decision overturned an earlier determination by the Supreme Court of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the federal court’s account of the theft, Wright, his brother Robert Wright and Robert Wright’s 15-year-old stepson on March 25, 2012, took sandwiches and two cases of beer from Martin’s Grocery in Harrisonburg and left without paying. Security guard Garrett Atkins then followed them to their minivan and took one of the cases of beer from Robert Wright’s hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At that point, Robert’s stepson stepped out of the minivan — with Wright on the opposite side of the van, out of Atkins’s view — and ‘took a fighting stance,’ telling Atkins, ‘I’m going to f— you up,” the ruling continued. “Robert then grabbed the beer back from Atkins, and Wright, Robert, and Robert’s stepson left in the minivan, taking with them the sandwiches and beer.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atkins testified at trial that he never spoke to Mark Wright on the day of the theft and that the “abnormal” events made him “uncomfortable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wright was charged with petit larceny, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and, most significantly, robbery because his brother physically took the case of beer from Atkins in the parking lot. The robbery charge carried a sentence of five years to life in prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After evidence was presented during the trial, prosecutors instructed the jury that it could convict Wright on the robbery charge or the lesser offense of grand larceny from the person — a crime that carries a sentence of zero to 20 years’ imprisonment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law allows a defendant to be convicted of a crime that they haven’t been charged with as long as the crime is a less serious offense than the original charge and there is evidence to support the lesser charge. Virginia courts have ruled that though robbery and grand larceny from the person are similar crimes that both involve stealing, they are not interchangeable. Robbery requires an element of violence or intimidation. Grand larceny from the person does not but requires prosecutors to prove the stolen goods were worth at least $5.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals later noted, the grand larceny charge “is not a lesser included offense of robbery under Virginia law. Nor was there any doubt on that point at the time of Wright’s trial.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jury subsequently acquitted Wright of robbery but found him guilty of the grand larceny charge and recommended a 10-year sentence, which a judge accepted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether, Wright was sentenced to more than 22 years in prison. (Half of that sentence was on charges related to the arrest of him and his brother, when bear deterrent was deployed against a sheriff’s deputy. </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opnscvwp/1150181.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia later found there was insufficient evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to show that Mark Wright had even been in the room at the time the bear deterrent was used, and a </span><a href="https://www.dnronline.com/news/crime/theft-case-under-review/article_d3574c92-c412-11e6-b150-176c2e748b01.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rockingham County judge ultimately dismissed the charges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Wright petitioned the Supreme Court of Virginia to review his case, arguing his attorney, Graves, had failed to assist him effectively. The state high court turned down his petition. It concluded that because Graves had testified that he “would not have objected to the instruction whether he did or did not know” the relevant law since it gave the jury the option of convicting his client on a less serious offense, the attorney had been operating on “strategy coupled with a lack of knowledge.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 4th Circuit rejected that conclusion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the correct and clearly established standard, trial counsel’s performance fell below prevailing professional norms when he failed, without justification, to inform himself of state law critical to his client’s case,” the court wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the three-judge panel ruled that Graves’ lack of objection to the jury instruction likely had a significant impact on the outcome of the trial. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It also is highly likely that a jury instructed only on robbery would have acquitted Wright of that charge: The actual jury did acquit Wright of robbery, finding that the Commonwealth had failed to prove the elements of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt,” the court wrote. “And had the jury been instructed on petit larceny, it might or might not have convicted Wright of that crime – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but either way, Wright would have served no more than one year for the offense, as opposed to his ten-year sentence on grand larceny from the person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following his release, Wright sued Graves for legal malpractice, a case the Virginia Court of Appeals is now allowing to go forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the appeals court’s ruling Tuesday centers on state law requiring individuals who bring criminal malpractice claims against their attorney to show they were actually innocent of the crime. Virginia, the opinion by Judge Stuart A. Raphael notes, “is among the majority of jurisdictions that impose an actual-innocence requirement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, Wright has repeatedly “pleaded that he was factually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted: grand larceny from the person,” the appeals court wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate concurring opinion, Judge Lisa Lorish wrote that the case raises the question of “whether his case merits an exception to the general rule that a criminal-malpractice plaintiff must prove actual innocence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Graves’ attorneys did not respond to a request for comment. </span></p>

(Ariel Skelley/Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child care is unaffordable for the majority of Virginia families with young children and nearly all low-income families with young children, a study by the state’s legislative watchdog found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, child care is unaffordable for 85% of Virginia families with infants, 82% of families with toddlers and 74% of families with preschoolers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those percentages are even higher among low-income Virginians, with child care being unaffordable for 98% of families with infants, 98% of families with toddlers and 97% of families with preschoolers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infants are generally defined as children ages 0 to 15 months, with toddlers ages 16 to 23 months and preschoolers ages 2 to 4 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recent literature indicates that without child care, parents are often forced to reduce their work hours, take lower-level or lower-paying jobs or drop out of the workforce altogether,” said Stefanie Papps, a JLARC staffer who led the study, during a presentation Monday. “Although this can be a significant barrier to self-sufficiency for lower-income families, lack of affordable child care can be a significant barrier to employment for any family.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36640" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1151px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36640" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability.jpg" alt="" width="1151" height="666" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability.jpg 1151w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability-300x174.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC-child-care-affordability-768x444.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1151px) 100vw, 1151px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Child care affordability in Virginia. (Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In arriving at those figures, JLARC relied on the federal government’s definition that child care is unaffordable if it costs more than 7% of household income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In some areas of the country, including the Northeast and South, child care can be a family’s largest household expense — more expensive than even their rent or mortgage,” the commission wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statewide, researchers found Virginia families spend $100 to $440 per week, per child on care, with the highest expenses found in Northern Virginia. Care is generally most expensive when children are youngest, both because parents tend to be younger and earning less pay and because required staffing ratios at licensed facilities are higher for younger children, who need more intensive care and supervision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Annual incomes need to be approximately 13 to 38 percent higher to afford care for infants and toddlers in child care centers, depending on the region of the state,” JLARC wrote. “These incomes would be necessary to afford care for one child; higher incomes would be needed to afford care for more than one child.” </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36641" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:848px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC_median-income-child-care.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36641" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC_median-income-child-care.jpg" alt="" width="848" height="433" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC_median-income-child-care.jpg 848w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC_median-income-child-care-300x153.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JLARC_median-income-child-care-768x392.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Percentage of median income Virginians spend on child care. (Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation could worsen. Pandemic-era expansions to a federal child care subsidy program expired this Sept. 30, and an additional $15 billion in child care grants to states that target low-income families is set to end Sept. 30, 2024. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, has previously warned the end of the expanded subsidies </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/13/democrats-push-to-extend-child-care-grant-program/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could cause 80,000 children in the commonwealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to lose their child care slots, in line with </span><a href="https://tcf.org/content/report/child-care-cliff/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimates by the Century Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a progressive think tank. JLARC on Monday put the figure at 25,000 children.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission concluded it would cost the state almost $320 million annually to extend all of the pandemic-era expansions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a significant gap between available funding and funding that’s needed to continue to meet family demand for child care,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, during Monday’s meeting. “So it falls to the General Assembly to meet this demand.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach and chair of the House Appropriations Committee, said lawmakers “knew it wasn’t going to last” and noted that Virginia’s Democratic Sens. Kaine and Mark Warner “understand this is a problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re the ones who kind of put a mandate on the state of Virginia, because they, Congress, gave us this money to help us in a time when we needed help,” he said. “Sometimes it’s hard to fund the problem and pull the plug on it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an Oct. 10 letter in response to JLARC’s findings, Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Services John Littel wrote that the impending drop in child care subsidy funding “should receive a disproportionate share of attention.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Littel further said it was “imperative” that Virginia “analyze the full ecosystem of child care programming” and “facilitate a more extensive dialogue around solutions that address the full spectrum of cost-driving factors.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This review must include reducing regulatory burdens that impede flexibility and fostering discussions about private sector innovation to build sustainable capacity,” he wrote. “Additionally, increasing home-based care options and expanding opportunities provided by houses of worship and other community partners will be critical to expanding choices for families.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While JLARC found that regulations do influence child care costs, it concluded that “most of Virginia’s regulations appear appropriate.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Papps said that staffing ratios — the number of children a child care worker is allowed to oversee — are the most significant regulation impacting costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“However, when compared to staffing ratios in other states, Virginia’s ratios were relatively similar to ratios in other states,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, Virginia requires licensed providers to have one staff member for every four infants, every five toddlers or every eight to 10 preschoolers. Amendments to the state budget temporarily relaxed those ratios for centers that participate in the federal subsidy program through June 30, 2024 in an effort to help with staffing shortages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A JLARC survey of child care providers found that most “do not believe that regulations seem too stringent or not stringent enough.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just one-third of providers reported at least some regulations are too stringent,” the commission wrote. “Further, most child care providers and other relevant stakeholders interviewed reported that the state’s regulations seem appropriate to maintain children’s health and safety, and the staffing ratios create manageable working conditions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the commission noted that Virginia’s background check requirements are stricter than those in other states and federal guidance, and that materials included in required staff training aren’t always relevant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Papps pointed to staffing challenges as “the root of the child care access and affordability issue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Child care workers are generally earning relatively low wages — wages that would put many of these workers below the self-sufficiency standard,” she said. JLARC found that on average, “lead teachers” in child care centers earned $16 per hour in fall 2022, while assistants earned $13 per hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Higher compensation leads to more staff, increasing the availability of care but increasing the cost and decreasing the affordability of care,” Papps said. “Lower compensation decreases operating costs, lowering the cost of care paid by parents, but can lead to staffing shortages that limit providers’ capacity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Spotsylvania, called the situation “a catch-22.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order to have more availability, you’re going to have to increase the cost, ergo making it less affordable,” he said. “So y’all’s recommendation is: ‘Good luck.’” </span></p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to clarify that pandemic-era child care subsidies expired Sept. 30, 2023, with additional funding set to expire Sept. 30, 2024.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a decision that touched on the finer points of how policies become law, the court ruled that language in the state budget overrode conflicting directives in a 2020 law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is hard to imagine a more definitive statement of the General Assembly’s intention that the provisions of the budget enacted in 2022 should be given effect over any other conflicting law,” wrote Justice Wesley G. Russell in a unanimous opinion Thursday that upheld an earlier decision in Albemarle County Circuit Court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high court’s ruling is a legal defeat for an estimated 8,000 inmates who over time could have been released early under an “enhanced” form of the state’s earned sentence credit system Democrats passed in 2020. Opponents of the GOP-led 2022 budget change altering that system have been particularly critical of its impact on more than 500 inmates who the state had notified would be released shortly after July 2022 before backtracking just weeks before they expected to be let out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia on behalf of one of those inmates, Antoine Anderson, who is being held at Coffeewood Correctional Center in Culpeper County. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0V6kWFu2kA"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/16/aclu-of-virginia-sues-department-of-corrections-over-earned-sentence-credits/">ACLU of Virginia sues Department of Corrections over earned sentence credits</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;ACLU of Virginia sues Department of Corrections over earned sentence credits&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/16/aclu-of-virginia-sues-department-of-corrections-over-earned-sentence-credits/embed/#?secret=0zpi6oQUqe#?secret=0V6kWFu2kA" data-secret="0V6kWFu2kA" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2020, Virginia inmates could have their sentences reduced by up to 4.5 days every 30 days for good behavior. That year, the Democratic-controlled General Assembly passed a law that retroactively increased the number of credits inmates could earn in a 30-day period to 15, moving up those individuals’ release dates. The law set a date of July 1, 2022 for the new system to go into effect. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the legislation prohibited the enhanced credits from being applied to sentences for certain violent crimes, it allowed inmates with “mixed” sentences — imposed for both violent and nonviolent crimes — to reduce the sentences they received for their nonviolent crimes more quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In preparation for the new system, the Virginia Department of Corrections </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/11/a-slap-in-the-face-prisoners-families-have-hopes-dashed-by-governors-amendment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notified hundreds of prisoners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including Anderson, that they would be released early, and families began preparing for their return. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June 2022, however, Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed an amendment to the budget that would prevent inmates with mixed sentences from being eligible for any enhanced credits. The change </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/17/general-assembly-hands-youngkin-some-wins-losses-on-budget-amendments/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">narrowly passed the legislature</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with three Democrats — Sens. John Bell of Loudoun, Lynwood Lewis of Accomack and Monty Mason of Williamsburg — joining Republicans in its support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson, who had previously been notified he would be released in the first wave of inmates eligible for the enhanced credits, was subsequently told he would remain incarcerated until April 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First arrested on federal drug charges in 2004, Anderson that August received a 13-year state sentence after he tried to break out of the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail where he was being held. He received four sentences for that attempt: one year for attempted escape, five years for abduction, two years for assault on a law enforcement officer, and five years for a second assault on a law enforcement officer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the 2020 law, Anderson would have been eligible to earn enhanced credits to reduce his sentences for attempted escape and assault on a law enforcement officer but could not have decreased his sentence for abduction more quickly. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;‘A slap in the face’: Prisoners, families have hopes dashed by governor’s amendment&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/07/11/a-slap-in-the-face-prisoners-families-have-hopes-dashed-by-governors-amendment/embed/#?secret=RBx4CLUyos#?secret=GaCP0lH05I" data-secret="GaCP0lH05I" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the lawsuit, the ACLU of Virginia argued that the budget change couldn’t be used to halt the early releases of inmates who had accrued credits under the 2020 system. The group contended that while the 2020 law had specified it applied “retroactively,” the budget amendment had not included that language. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the Supreme Court of Virginia rejected that argument on the grounds that because the 2020 law wasn’t scheduled to go into effect until July 1, 2022, none of the inmates had actually earned any enhanced credits before the budget change was implemented. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2020 law “did not go into effect prior to July 1, 2022, and has never been in effect without the modification,” Russell wrote. “As a result, neither Anderson nor others similarly situated have ever been eligible to receive enhanced [earned sentence credits].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU of Virginia said it was “disappointed” in the ruling, but “the fight is far from over.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislature can and should keep its promise to people who have done the hard work to earn a second chance,” said attorney Geri Greenspan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court of Virginia </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/opinion.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled in favor of another inmate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> represented by the ACLU of Virginia, Steven Prease, who had argued the state was unlawfully limiting his eligibility for the enhanced sentence credits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prease contended that he could earn the enhanced credits for attempted aggravated murder because it was not explicitly listed among the crimes state law declared ineligible for quicker release, while the Virginia Department of Corrections argued the General Assembly had intended to include it. The court rejected that argument, and Prease was released July 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ACLU of Virginia has since filed </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/press-releases/aclu-virginia-files-two-new-cases-calling-vadoc-release-people-who-have-earned" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two more cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> arguing the corrections department is unlawfully interpreting the law to deny other inmates early release.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Virginia State Police is aware of and tracking the various local law enforcement agencies that responded to bomb threats called in to local schools across the commonwealth yesterday and today,” said Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Geller noted that local law enforcement and school districts aren’t required to report threats to VSP, she said the agency is aware of seven occurring across Virginia Oct. 10 “and several more happening today and in other states.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local agencies, including those in Madison County, have said they </span><a href="https://www.cbs19news.com/story/49809988/investigation-underway-into-threat-against-schools-in-madison-county" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe the threats were part of a nationwide hoax</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to local reports from around Virginia, the following school districts have received threats: </span></p>

The practice, known as swatting, has become increasingly disruptive in Virginia and nationwide. Earlier this month, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/10/04/school-swatting-hoax-active-shooter/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that more than 500 schools in the U.S. have been targeted in a “coordinated campaign” of hoax threats over the past year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today concludes a multi-year investigation and prosecution by my office,” said Attorney General Jason Miyares in a release announcing the sentencing of Bhagavan “Doc” Antle. “In Virginia, we uphold the rule of law without exception, whether dealing with violent repeat offenders, big pharma, fraudsters and scammers, or wildlife traffickers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antle, the owner of 50-acre tropical preserve Myrtle Beach Safari, came under scrutiny by Virginia officials because of his relationship with Keith Wilson, the owner of Wilson’s Wild Animal Park in Winchester. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After state agents raided the Winchester zoo and seized 119 wild animals, including lions and tigers, in 2019, </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/wilsons-wild-animal-park-owner-nephew-plead-in-animal-cruelty-case/article_d34bfb2e-ac76-11ec-82fd-23c0455c977e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilson was convicted of 27 counts of animal cruelty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and forbidden to own, sell or work with any exotic species. (His nephew was also convicted on 19 counts of animal cruelty.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a separate case, a Frederick grand jury </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/2020/WilsonIndictments.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in October 2020 indicted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> both Wilson and Antle for conspiring with each other to traffick lions in violation of the federal Endangered Species Act, as well as engaging in animal cruelty. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This June, a Frederick jury convicted Antle of two felony counts of wildlife trafficking and two felony counts of conspiring to traffick wildlife. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiger-king-documentary-antle-trafficking-conviction-689456335b6be5cc51f87f48f7463539" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Associated Press</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the prosecution characterized Antle’s purchases of lion cubs from the Winchester zoo as a “cub pipeline” from Virginia to South Carolina that operated illegally after lions were designated endangered in 2015. Antle’s defense attorney, Erin Harrigan, argued the lion cubs Antle received were gifts from Wilson, and that Antle had separately donated thousands of dollars to Wilson’s zoo for an expanded tiger habitat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the terms of his sentence, Antle isn’t allowed to “work, own, possess, broker, buy, sell, trade, transfer, barter or donate any exotic animals for five years in the Commonwealth of Virginia.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he violates the law or those terms during the next five years, he could be subject to two years of incarceration that are otherwise suspended.</span></p>
<p>Antle&#8217;s attorneys, Eric Breslin and Erin Harrigan, said they were &#8220;pleased and grateful that the judge rejected the government&#8217;s request for incarceration and saw Mr. Antle&#8217;s immense value in his work and family community.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Antle was convicted on four charges that amount to failing to obtain a permit for otherwise entirely lawful activity in the highly-regulated industry that is exhibiting endangered species,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;These charges have never been brought in Virginia before, and the commonwealth’s case suffers from a variety of factual and legal defects. As we have maintained since his conviction at trial, we remain confident Mr. Antle will be fully vindicated by the courts in Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-22-02800-225.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sept. 29 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the department’s Office of the Inspector General recounts the experiences of a patient in their 60s who came to the Hampton facility’s emergency department in late September 2021 complaining of chest pain. A CT scan that day found a mass in the patient’s chest that was considered “worrisome for malignancy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the report found the patient wasn’t seen by a respiratory specialist until 77 days after they came to the emergency department and 58 days after their primary care provider requested that consultation — a delay the Hampton VA hospital’s chief of staff characterized as “highly unacceptable.” A diagnosis wasn’t determined until 151 days after the patient first came to the hospital for their complaint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The patient died just over a month later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The inspector general found that “multiple care coordination deficiencies, including scheduling delays, ineffective communication, and insufficient pain management, led to a delay in diagnosis and treatment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s two Democratic U.S. senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, released a joint statement Monday about what they called “alarming logistical and communication failures.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The promise of quality and timely health care is one of the most important commitments we make to the brave men and women who serve our nation, and this Inspector General report makes it clear that the Hampton VA failed to live up to that promise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” they wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides diagnosis and treatment delays, the report noted “insufficient pain management,” a failure to follow up on the patient after discharge from the emergency department and a lack of daily “huddles,” when health care providers convene to flag any patient issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the absence of daily huddles, patient safety and care may be negatively impacted due to possible delays in addressing patient care needs,” the inspector general’s office wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the report found the Hampton medical facility did not have a required cancer committee or tumor board to review cancer patient needs and treatment, although both have been created since the inspector general’s review. The hospital also may have been underreporting the number of cancer patients it treated in a national registry, with only 52 patients registered from 2020 to February 2022. In March 2022, the director of the VA’s National Program Office for Oncology emailed the Hampton facility director to flag the low number of registrations, noting, “Hampton likely has 250-300 patients to report annually.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, as of April 2020, cancer was the second leading cause of death among veterans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without an active facility cancer committee and tumor board, the facility was unable to conduct the additional review necessary to assist with the assessment and identification of cancer patients’ needs,” the report said. “As a result, there may have been negative impacts on patients’ quality of oncological care.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a memo included with the report, Hampton VA Medical Center Director Taquisa Simmons called the inspector general’s findings “a thorough evaluation” and agreed with seven recommendations to address the problems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are deeply saddened by the loss of this patient at the Hampton VA Health Care System, and we empathize regarding the impact this has had on the veteran’s family and the staff within the health care system who are very passionate about the care they provide veterans,” Simmons wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The September report is the second time in less than two years that the Office of the Inspector General has documented problems at the Hampton VA hospital. In June 2022, the office released </span><a href="https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-21-03349-186.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlining “facility providers’ failures to communicate, act on, and document abnormal test results that led to a delay in a patient’s diagnosis of prostate cancer.”</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After months of fighting that disrupted health care </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/04/messy-bon-secours-anthem-dispute-threatens-to-disrupt-care-for-thousands-of-virginians-on-medicare/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for 11,000 Virginians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hospital system Bon Secours Mercy Health and insurer Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield have reached an agreement in a dispute over reimbursement rates, the companies announced Friday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal will once again allow patients with Medicare Advantage plans through Anthem to get more favorable in-network prices for care through Bon Secours, which operates numerous hospitals and health care facilities in Richmond, Newport News, Suffolk and Kilmarnock. Since Aug. 1, those patients have been considered out of network for Bon Secours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also means an additional 39,000 Virginians with managed Medicaid plans through Anthem won’t lose in-network coverage at Bon Secours beginning Oct. 1. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand that being out of network/potentially being out of network can be very difficult, and we are pleased that patients with Anthem insurance can now see our physicians and use our hospitals at an in-network cost,” said Mike Lutes, president of Bon Secours Richmond, in a joint statement Friday.  “We sincerely believe that access to quality health care services is vital for our communities. This new agreement protects our patients’ access to compassionate care close to home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthem Virginia President Monica Schmude said the two companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“worked together to creatively address affordability for our members and the financial needs of an important care provider.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This agreement provides long-term stable access to care at Bon Secours without cost increases for our members and employers,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Bon Secours and Anthem are not disclosing the details of their agreement, citing confidentiality provisions in their contract, their joint statement notes it will ensure continued coverage for both Anthem Medicare Advantage and Medicaid health plan members while extending coverage for Anthem employer-based and Affordable Care Act plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthem has agreed to cover any claims from Medicare Advantage patients who received care from Bon Secours during the nearly two-month period it was out of network. Bon Secours has agreed to dismiss </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/29/bon-secours-sues-anthem-over-alleged-slow-pay-and-no-pay-tactics-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lawsuit it filed against Anthem in Henrico Circuit Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over alleged “slow pay and no-pay tactics” in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two groups also said they will “form collaborative teams to address claims submissions and payment processes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The messy dispute between the health system and the insurer has largely centered on reimbursement rates, the payments insurance companies make to health care providers to cover the cost of services delivered to patients. Health systems and insurers regularly enter into contracts to set those rates, which determine whether care is considered “in-network” or “out of network” for patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the most recent fight, Anthem said Bon Secours had asked for double-digit reimbursement rate increases midway through a three-year contract between the two and then, when its request wasn’t met, exercised an option allowing it to end in-network coverage for patients with Medicare Advantage plans through Anthem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bon Secours in turn contended the rates Anthem was paying were “substantially less” than those paid by other insurers and said the insurer was withholding tens of millions of dollars in late and unpaid claims. </span></p>

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals on Tuesday upheld a 2020 decision by the Virginia Employment Commission that Amazon’s logistics arm had misclassified delivery drivers who work under its Uber-like Flex system as independent contractors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling stems from a case that began in 2019 when former Flex driver Ronald Diggs filed an unemployment claim with the VEC. The commission subsequently found the work Diggs and other Flex drivers had performed for Amazon as independent contractors should be classified as employment, and ordered the company to pay unemployment insurance taxes for all other drivers who were “misclassified as independent contractors.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Sept. 26, a three-judge panel of the state appeals court found that “the evidence supports the Commission’s determination that Diggs was an Amazon employee” and that it was reasonable for the commission to extend that conclusion to all other Flex drivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Amazon’s Flex driver program, independent drivers compete for available delivery routes through an app and then are responsible for collecting and dropping off all of the packages on that route. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s simple: You use your own vehicle to deliver packages for Amazon as a way of earning extra money to move you closer to your goals,” the company says on its Flex website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon considers Flex drivers self-employed independent contractors. Among other arguments in an appeal of VEC’s decision in Richmond City Circuit Court, the company contended Flex drivers “are free to conduct the manner and means of the delivery services without instruction from Amazon” and “have no set hours of work, do not work full time, do not make any regular oral or written reports to Amazon, are free to choose their own routes to deliver packages, and are paid ‘by the job,’ not hourly, weekly, or monthly.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission, however, disputed that classification. State law directs the commission to rely on 20 factors outlined by the Internal Revenue Service in determining whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee for tax purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those 20 factors include the employer’s provision of training to the worker, a continuing relationship between the worker and employer, set hours of work, the requirement that a worker be full time or work on the employer’s premises, the employer’s furnishing of a worker with tools and materials, the employer’s ability to order that a worker do a job in a particular sequence, and the ability of a worker to work for more than one firm at a time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Generally the relationship of employer and employee exists when the person or persons for whom the services are performed have the right to control and direct the individual who performs the services, not only as to the result to be accomplished by the work but also as to the details and means by which that result is accomplished,” the commission quoted the IRS in support of its determination. “That is, an employee is subject to the will and control of the employer not only as to what shall be done but as to how it shall be done.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission argued that many of the 20 factors showed that Amazon exerted a level of control over Diggs — and, by extension, other Flex drivers — that was more in line with a relationship between an employer and employee rather than an employer and an independent contractor. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Flex drivers were given specific instructions “about when, where, and how they are to work,” including where they had to place packages, were required to undergo training in the form of mandatory video tutorials, were compelled to follow a particular sequence of services, were required to contact the company about any problems they encountered and were subject to regular reporting through the driver app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VEC also concluded that even though drivers were paid by delivery block, or route, “all delivery blocks reflected a $20.00 per hour rate,” meaning they received “in effect, an hourly rate of pay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon appealed that conclusion in both Richmond Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether, when, and how frequently to provide delivery services to Amazon customers are … entirely within delivery partners’ discretion,” the company wrote in filings with the Richmond Circuit Court. “When making deliveries, delivery partners control all aspects of the delivery service, including how to load packages, how to sequence deliveries, and how to complete deliveries.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon also pointed in its defense to the independent contractor agreement it enters with Flex drivers, which it said “confirms the independent-contractor relationship between each Delivery Partner and Amazon and expressly disclaims the existence of any employment relationship.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In later proceedings, Virginia’s appeals court rejected that argument. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Contrary to Amazon’s contentions, the commission’s determination that ‘Amazon required Flex drivers to comply with specific instructions on when, where and how delivery blocks were to be completed’ is supported by the record,” the judges wrote. “That the text of the agreement purports to give Flex drivers control over the ‘means and manner’ for providing services does not negate the commission’s determination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, whose office represented the VEC, told the Mercury he was &#8220;pleased with today’s decision from the Court of Appeals and I am proud of my office’s efforts to ensure that these workers are treated fairly and given the benefits they rightly deserve. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A request for comment from Amazon’s lead attorney in the appeal did not receive a response.  </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite stiff winds, drenching rains and coastal storm surges, Virginia pulled through Tropical Storm Ophelia relatively unscathed this weekend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Orrock, chief meteorologist for the National Weather Service’s Wakefield office, which covers most of central and eastern Virginia, said Hampton Roads saw the most severe storm impacts Friday night into Saturday morning, with central Virginia feeling the brunt on Saturday through the evening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was kind of a weird one-two punch,” he said. “It pretty much went from Friday afternoon all the way through Saturday evening.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ophelia, which strengthened from a potential tropical cyclone into a tropical storm on Friday, made landfall near Emerald Isle in North Carolina early Saturday morning before moving up the East Coast through Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Weather Service measured winds of 45 to 60 mph in coastal areas and 35 to 40 mph in central Virginia as the storm weakened over the course of its northward march. The gale caused downed trees and power outages, and exacerbated the effects of tidal flooding along the state’s rivers, but no fatalities or major destruction were reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was a significant event for us that caused disruptions, but it’s not the worst that we have seen,” said Ben McFarlane, chief resiliency officer for the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36417" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:990px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wakefield_Ophelia_precip.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36417" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wakefield_Ophelia_precip.png" alt="" width="990" height="761" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wakefield_Ophelia_precip.png 990w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wakefield_Ophelia_precip-300x231.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Wakefield_Ophelia_precip-768x590.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (National Weather Service Wakefield)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeremy Slayton, a spokesperson for Dominion Energy, the primary electricity provider for much of eastern and central Virginia, said about 170,000 utility customers had outages over the weekend, but all service was restored by Sunday afternoon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any time you have a storm like that with a combination of heavy rain and heavy wind, we have to contend with branches falling,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In preparation for Ophelia’s arrival, Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/22/youngkin-declares-state-of-emergency-ahead-of-tropical-storm-ophelia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared a state of emergency Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a move that gave state agencies more flexibility to deploy resources to respond to the storm. The Virginia National Guard staged roughly 35 soldiers at Virginia Natural Gas facilities in Hampton Roads to assist with transporting people through potential high water or removing debris. The Virginia Emergency Operations Center and Virginia Emergency Support Team were also activated, although the state Department of Emergency Management was unable to speak with the Mercury Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forecasts by the National Hurricane Center predicted coastal areas could see storm surge of between 2 to 4 feet above ground level, with 3 to 5 inches of rain in Hampton Roads and 2 to 4 inches of rain through the Interstate 95 corridor in central Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orrock of the National Weather Service in Wakefield said storm impacts played out in line with predictions. The eastern portion of the state saw about 3 feet of storm surge, and both Hampton Roads and central Virginia received between 3 and 5 inches of precipitation. A <a href="https://www.weather.gov/media/akq/briefings/LatestBriefing.pdf" target="_blank">Monday briefing from the Wakefield office</a> noted while many area rivers rose due to Ophelia&#8217;s rainfall, they remain below flood stages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Luckily the rivers were low,” said Orrock. “They were able to absorb the rainfall pretty easily.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McFarlane said there were reports of some roadways and cars flooding in Norfolk and Portsmouth, but the timing of the high tides over the weekend helped reduce impacts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We got the high tide at kind of a fortuitous time, because it was in the middle of the night,” he said. “This could have been a lot worse.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency in Virginia Friday ahead of a tropical storm that is expected to bring severe rainfall and flooding, as well as potential wind damage to the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As this storm has organized and strengthened, it’s becoming clear based on the latest forecasts that impacts to the commonwealth are likely,” said Youngkin. “We want to ensure that all communities, particularly those with the greatest anticipated impact, have the resources they need to respond and recover from the effects of this storm.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Brennan, director of the National Hurricane Center, said Virginia will see significant storm surge along the coastlines and rivers, as well as heavy rainfall beginning Friday evening and continuing throughout Saturday. Rain is expected to ease on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s going to be a rough day in portions of central and eastern Virginia,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of Tropical Storm Ophelia, the National Hurricane Center is forecasting that coastal Virginia could see 2 to 4 feet of storm surge above the normal ground level, with the surge lasting over multiple tide cycles. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Hampton Roads is expected to see between 3 to 5 inches of rainfall, with up to 7 inches possible in some places, said Brennan. The Interstate 95 corridor stretching from roughly Richmond up to Northern Virginia will see about 2 to 4 inches of rainfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of storm surge and heavy precipitation is likely to produce flooding throughout the eastern portion of the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The rainfall is not going to be able to drain very well,” said Brennan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to water impacts, forecasters expect sustained 40 mph winds with occasional gusts and some risk of tornadoes developing in the eastern portion of the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, said Brennan, “we’re not expecting widespread significant wind damage.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-27---Declaration-of-a-State-of-Emergency-Due-to-Severe-Flooding-and-Tropical-Storm-Impacts-Across-the-Commonwealth-(1).pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state of emergency declared by Youngkin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Friday gives Virginia greater flexibility to mobilize resources and equipment to respond to the storm, including activating Virginia’s Emergency Operations Center and the Virginia Emergency Support Team, putting into effect anti-price gouging measures and authorizing up to $350,000 in response and recovery funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since this storm has the potential to have a range of impacts across numerous localities in the commonwealth, I encourage all Virginians and visitors to keep up with the latest forecast for their area from a trusted source, </span><a href="https://www.vaemergency.gov/prepare/make-a-plan" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make a plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and have their </span><a href="https://www.vaemergency.gov/prepare/emergency-kit?" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emergency kits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ready,” said Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brennan said Virginians should remember that the deadliest hazard of tropical storms is water, with most fatalities linked to fresh water flooding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Saturday’s going to be a pretty good day to be inside,” he said.   </span></p>

(Marisa Demarco / Source New Mexico)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Virginia congresswomen are pushing for federal recognition of the Patawomeck Indian Tribe, whose presence in present-day Stafford and King George counties can be traced back to the 1300s and was noted in some of European colonists’ earliest records. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our community has always been here, and we have been a strong part of the fabric of our Virginia home,” said Patawomeck Chief Charles “Bootsie” Bullock in a statement. “We are not only descendants of many centuries of our ancestors, but today we are neighbors, colleagues, friends, and proud Americans — and our heritage deserves to be recognized by the federal government like other Indigenous communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Patawomeck Indian Tribe won state recognition from Virginia in 2010 and today has over 2,600 enrolled members, most of whom live in Stafford County. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://d12t4t5x3vyizu.cloudfront.net/spanberger.house.gov/uploads/2023/09/9-15-Patawomeck-Federal-Recognition-Bill-Text.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-sponsored by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun, and Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, seeks to secure federal recognition for the tribe, which would extend sovereignty rights to the Patawomeck while also allowing them to access federal benefits, services and protections. Among those is the right to federal consultation, or the requirement that federal agencies seek input from tribal officials in developing regulations or policies that might impact Indigenous nations. The tribe <a href="https://fredericksburg.com/news/local/staffords-patawomeck-tribe-seeks-federal-recognition/article_d1410c9d-0ad2-5b4f-b1b9-010bef9a43f3.html" target="_blank">announced it was seeking federal recognition through legislation in January 2022</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of February, </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47414#:~:text=A%20federally%20recognized%20Tribe%20is,for%20a%20recognized%20Tribe%2C%20including" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">574 tribes in the U.S.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had received federal recognition, including seven in Virginia: the Chickahominy Indian Tribe, Eastern Chickahominy Indian Tribe, Monacan Indian Nation, Nansemond Indian Nation, Pamunkey Indian Tribe, Rappahannock Tribe and Upper Mattaponi Indian Tribe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while Virginia’s tribes are among the first Indigenous nations recorded by European colonists, none were able to achieve federal recognition until 2016; six won it through federal legislation rather than the typical administrative review process overseen by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tough road to recognition for the tribes can be traced to a longstanding state law that officially erased the nations’ existence by classifying Virginia’s populace as either white or Black, as well as the widespread destruction of state and local records during the Civil War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To obtain federal recognition, </span><a href="https://www.doi.gov/ocl/Federal-Acknowledgement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tribes must meet seven criteria</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including demonstrating that they’ve been “identified as an American Indian entity on a substantially continuous basis since 1900” and that a “predominant portion” of their membership “comprises a distinct community and has existed as a community from historical times until the present.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “continuous” part of the criteria has been especially difficult for Virginia tribes. Because so much of the Civil War was fought in the commonwealth — </span><a href="https://virginiahistory.org/research/research-resources/guides-researchers/civil-war-virginia-published-primary-sources" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 2,000 military engagements and 26 major battles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — dozens of courthouses and official records repositories were </span><a href="https://www.lva.virginia.gov/public/guides/rn30_lostrecords.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">destroyed or extensively damaged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Among those were the Stafford and King George courthouses, where records of the Patawomeck could have been found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recently, the state’s Racial Integrity Act of 1924 classified every Virginia resident as white or Black. One of its major supporters, former Virginia Bureau of Vital Statistics Chief Walter Plecker, for years ordered that the bureau alter the birth and death certificates of Virginia Indians to identify them as Black. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dr. Plecker has compelled an unestimated number of Virginians of mixed blood to be registered, willing or unwilling, as Negroes,” noted a 1935 profile of Plecker in The Richmond Times-Dispatch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state policy came to be known as a “paper” or “documentary genocide” that would prevent federal recognition for decades. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a release Monday, Spanberger said the Patawomeck’s “long history, their rich traditions, and their centuries of contributions to Virginia deserve respect and recognition.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The federal government is long overdue to acknowledge what the Commonwealth of Virginia and the members of the Patawomeck Tribe themselves already know to be true,” she said.</span></p>

			<div class="snrsInfoboxSubContainer" style="padding-top:24px;">
				
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger, Wexton and Kiggans’ legislation notes several key moments in the tribe’s history recorded in European and later U.S. documents. They include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1608: John Smith visits the village of Patawomeke, which has an estimated population of 800, with 160 bowmen, as well as nearby Patawomeck villages at Passapatanzy and Quiyough. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1610: “Japazaw, brother of the Patawomeck weroance, related the Patawomeck creation story to Captain Samuel Argall, the only surviving Virginia Algonquian creation story recorded by the English.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">July 1666: Virginia’s General Council declares war on the Patawomeck, killing most of the tribe’s men and enslaving most of the women and children. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1789: White Oak Church is built in Stafford and becomes a gathering space for Patawomeck tribal members, who used it “to pass down and maintain Tribal knowledge and traditions, meet suitable Patawomeck marriage partners, and conduct business in formal and informal ways.” </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1930s-1940s: “At least 722 Patawomeck ancestors were taken from their graves under the guise of archaeological research. Many of these ancestors were discarded by the excavators.” Over 200 are currently held by the Smithsonian. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1996: Patawomeck Tribe adopts a written constitution. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2006: Patawomeck tribal members begin reconstructing their native Algonquin language.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2010: Patawomeck receive official state recognition from Virginia.</span></li>

Glenn Youngkin prepares to sign amendments to Virginia's two-year budget in Richmond on Sept. 14, 2023. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed long-delayed amendments to Virginia’s two-year budget on the steps of the state capitol Thursday, concluding a six-month process that has left many local and state agency initiatives in limbo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You waited a long time for this day — too long, candidly,” Youngkin said. “But we came together and got it done.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to billions in surplus funds, the budget amendments negotiated by the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate offered both parties wins: almost $1 billion in tax reductions for Republicans, largely produced by one-time tax rebates, and major new investments in state programs for Democrats, with a reliance on one-time spending. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;What&#8217;s in Virginia&#8217;s long-delayed 2023 budget deal&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/05/whats-in-virginias-long-delayed-2023-budget-deal/embed/#?secret=0ReMG0Vplq#?secret=LkPeUmh4V4" data-secret="LkPeUmh4V4" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we put politics down and pick common sense up, look at what we can accomplish together,” said Youngkin Thursday in a speech that both disavowed politics and pointedly criticized Democratic policies and prior administrations — a combination that has become the governor’s signature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now we’re in the middle of change: change to the way Virginia operates, change to a culture of winning, and change to governing in a way that reflects real results. This represents the reawakening of that spirit of Virginia,” Youngkin said, using a phrase that he has adopted for his Spirit of Virginia PAC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Youngkin’s desire to institute long-term tax cuts has mostly been stymied by Democrats during his first 20 months in office, the governor on Thursday touted the state’s “historic” $5 billion in tax reductions over the past two budgets, an amount he said has produced $2,200 in tax relief to a typical Virginia family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of that has or will come in the form of tax rebates, but the past two spending plans have also included major short-term changes to the standard deduction, which has nearly doubled from $4,500 to $8,500 for individuals and $9,000 to $17,000 for joint filers. The increases are scheduled to end in 2026. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investments highlighted by the governor Thursday included $200 million to help prepare sites for large-scale economic development projects, $653 million in new education spending, $170 million in behavioral health investments to further Youngkin’s “Right Help, Right Now” plan and $671 million in natural resources spending. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, one of the Democrats’ chief budget negotiators, said after the signing that many of the new investments were proposals from Senate Democrats, with some — like the extra 2% salary bump for teachers — supported by both parties in the legislature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin was particularly supportive of mental health spending, said Barker, who recounted an episode where Senate negotiators told the governor they intended to push for major investments in the area. Youngkin last December had </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/14/youngkin-proposes-230-million-behavioral-health-overhaul/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced his own plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for $230 million to overhaul Virginia’s struggling behavioral health system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He said, to his credit, ‘I’m not going to object to anything you put in on mental health,’” Barker said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite both Democrats and Republicans backing major behavioral health spending, the budget signed Thursday includes only $18 million for pay raises for staff at community services boards, the local agencies that provide community-based behavioral health and developmental disability services. Earlier proposals by the House and Senate would have put $37 million or $50 million, respectively, toward CSB staff raises. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We did what we could,” Barker said. “We had to be able to fund a lot of different things.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt571-4.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">December 2021 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Virginia’s legislative watchdog agency found “uncompetitive salaries” were a key driver of high turnover and staffing problems at CSBs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More than 80 percent of CSB executive directors reported that compensation was one of the top three factors that made it difficult for their CSB to recruit and hire qualified staff for behavioral health services,” the report noted before recommending that the General Assembly provide regular salary increases for CSB staff who provide direct care to residents. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia General Assembly passed long-delayed amendments to the two-year state budget Wednesday, ending a six-month stalemate and sending the document to Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin for his signature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/09/05/whats-in-virginias-long-delayed-2023-budget-deal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which many in Richmond had worried would not be reached after negotiations </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/28/what-caused-virginias-budget-breakdown-accounts-differ/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">briefly collapsed in July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, combines major short-term tax reductions with significant one-time and ongoing spending on priorities such as education, behavioral health and pollution reduction investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are things in this budget to like, and there are of course things that we may not like, we may not embrace,” said Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Fairfax, Wednesday. “But this is a compromise document, and that is the definition of a compromise: give and take.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Steve Newman, R-Bedford, called the final agreement “probably as fiscally responsible a bill as I’ve ever seen.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Republicans praised the plan’s emphasis on one-time spending — including almost $420 million in flexible payments to school divisions, $200 million to programs to prepare sites for industrial development and $58 million for expansion and modernization of state crisis services facilities — Democrats applauded its reliance on one-time tax relief in the form of rebates rather than longer-term tax cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This budget is a bipartisan, bicameral compromise,” said Del. Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach, who along with Sens. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, and George Barker, D-Fairfax, served as chief negotiator on the agreement. “Nothing is one-sided around here.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, struck a more partisan tone in a speech that leaned heavily on Democratic campaign issues like abortion and criticized earlier proposals from the Republican-controlled House that would have cut the state’s corporate tax rate, a plan Knight has said the chamber dropped early in negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians cannot afford to fund any outrageous or aggressive tax breaks the MAGA extremists wanted to suggest we can to big corporations,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most significant area of debate Wednesday concerned a procedural resolution put forward by leadership of both the Republican House and Democratic-controlled Senate that forbade any consideration of amendments to the budget deal, full details of which were first released Saturday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several members of both parties voiced concerns about the precedent the resolution might set for future debate about the state budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is this now the accepted way that we do things?” asked Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin. “We just wait until session is over and a gentle few of the chosen go inside and make those decisions for themselves, and then come out and say, ‘Here it is! And oh, by the way, you can’t amend it, you can’t participate for your constituents. You have to vote up or down.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. John Cosgrove, R-Chesapeake, argued that resolutions can be put forward during any session to change the procedures the chambers follow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should have had a budget months ago,” he said. “We should have done the people’s work months ago. We have the opportunity now to vote on this resolution so we can pass a budget.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the passage of the bill Wednesday, Democrats sent out press releases characterizing the deal as a Democratic victory over what the Senate caucus described as “Governor Youngkin’s ill-advised, nearly $1 billion tax giveaway plan.” </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Democrats fought tirelessly to preserve funding for crucial services such as public education, healthcare, mental health services, and affordable housing,” the caucus wrote. “We believe that a budget is a reflection of our values and priorities, and this budget gives our children the resources they need to succeed.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Republican messages meanwhile portrayed the tax provisions as providing “relief for Virginians struggling with rising costs of everyday expenses due to failed federal policies” and sharply faulted Democrats for not accepting a proposal to adjust the state’s tax brackets. </span></p>
<p><em>[<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/04/virginias-highest-tax-bracket-starts-at-17k-some-say-its-time-for-an-update/" target="_blank">Read more: Virginia&#8217;s highest tax bracket starts at $17K. Some say it&#8217;s time for an update.</a>]</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Had Senate Democrats not been terrified of their primary voters, we could have made historic reforms to our income tax system that would have put more money back into the pockets of those who need it most,” said Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, in a statement. “Those who make minimum wage don’t belong in Virginia’s highest tax bracket.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/28/what-caused-virginias-budget-breakdown-accounts-differ/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Knight said a preliminary deal the two parties reached earlier in the year would have updated the more than three-decade-old brackets, although some Democrats said they hadn’t heard about the offer until the summer. A state report released in November found that since 1990, the state’s median income rose 108% but </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/04/virginias-highest-tax-bracket-starts-at-17k-some-say-its-time-for-an-update/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taxes owed by single filers making the median income went up 173%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, Del. Joe McNamara, R-Salem, who previously introduced legislation to begin indexing the tax brackets to inflation, said he thought the General Assembly would either focus on adjusting the brackets or increasing the standard deduction but </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/04/virginias-highest-tax-bracket-starts-at-17k-some-say-its-time-for-an-update/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wouldn’t have “an appetite to do both.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s budget deal temporarily raised the standard deduction for the second time in two years, pushing it to $8,500 for individuals and $17,000 for joint filers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The budget will now go to Youngkin for his signature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While the process took longer than needed, more than $1 billion in tax relief is on the way to Virginia veterans, working families and businesses,” the governor said in a statement following the bill’s passage. “Additionally, this collaborative effort ensured the funding of our shared priorities: investing in students and teachers, supporting our law enforcement community and transforming the way behavioral health care is delivered in the Commonwealth.” </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A five-year plan for how Virginia intends to spend almost $1.5 billion in federal broadband funds concludes the state could achieve “functionally universal broadband access” by 2028.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In today’s increasingly digital world, having access to high-speed broadband is no longer a luxury, it is necessary in order to fully participate in daily life,” said Gov. Glenn Youngkin in a Friday release outlining the state’s plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding broadband access has been a growing priority of lawmakers both in Virginia and nationally over the past decade. Virginia, </span><a href="https://www.governing.com/infrastructure/the-data-center-capital-of-the-world-is-in-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whose history is intertwined with the internet’s rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has been especially proactive. The state began developing a broadband availability map in 2010; in 2017, it launched the Virginia Telecommunication Initiative to spearhead expansion efforts. Former Gov. Ralph Northam </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/virginia-gov-northam-announces-plan-for-universal-broadband-by-2024.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pledged during his term to achieve universal broadband access</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2028, a date he later advanced to 2024. </span></p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-nets-almost-1-5-billion-in-federal-broadband-funds/</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the more than $1.32 billion the state calculates has been invested in addressing the digital divide in Virginia has come from the federal government. Earlier this summer, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-nets-almost-1-5-billion-in-federal-broadband-funds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the commonwealth netted $1.48 billion more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the federal Broadband Equity, Accessibility and Deployment, or BEAD, grant program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/vati" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans released Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outline how the state intends to spend that money and the criteria it will use in awarding it to specific projects around Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roughly 160,000 locations in Virginia currently lack reliable access to internet and don’t have a funded solution in place to provide that service. Of those, over 134,000 are considered unserved, meaning they lack access at the level of 25 megabits per second download speeds and 3 megabits per second upload speeds. The remainder are classified as underserved, with access above that level but below 100 Mbps download speeds and 20 Mbps upload speeds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s five-year plan for use of its BEAD funding projects that achieving “universal service” in the commonwealth will require over $958.7 million in investments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the state’s plans, funding for new broadband infrastructure will be committed by the end of 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This means, every Virginia home, business, and community anchor institution that can be reached through a cost-effective solution will be included in a project for expansion of broadband infrastructure to their location,” the plan says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Construction of those projects will then take up to four years, with completion expected by 2028.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to addressing infrastructure shortfalls, Virginia’s broadband plans also sketch out goals for improving affordability of the service and increasing adoption among residents through digital skills training and other programs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the affordability front, Virginia is aiming to increase state use of the </span><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/acp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal Affordable Connectivity Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which subsidizes broadband costs for households that have an income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level or participate in programs like Medicaid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of July 2023, almost 385,000 households in the commonwealth had enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program, “meaning Virginians are receiving at least $11.5 million in subsidies monthly towards the cost of their broadband services, not factoring for possible $70 monthly benefits for Tribal beneficiaries,” the plan notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Virginia calculates that an additional 715,000 households are eligible for but not enrolled in the program, resulting in the state “missing out on over $21 million per month in federal subsidy funds.” </span></p>

This year’s plan has many of the same features, although a House Appropriations Committee </span><a href="https://hac.virginia.gov/Committee/files/2023/9-6-23%20SSI/Consolidated%20Powerpoint%20for%20Conference%209-1-2023.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget document </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">notes that negotiators, “understanding that revenue growth may be subsiding, focused on funding one-time initiatives instead of building up ongoing programs to the extent possible.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether, the House calculates the proposed budget will route an additional $1.1 billion to ongoing programs, with roughly $1.5 billion going to new one-time funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the 758-page document is chock-a-block with information, here are some of the key proposals to know. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax reductions: Mostly one-time rebates, more standard deduction adjustments </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final deal includes $1.05 billion in tax reductions, most of which — $906 million — will come from </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/2/HB6001/Introduced/3/3-5.28/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-time tax rebates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This year, individual Virginians will get up to $200 in tax rebates, and joint filers will get up to $400. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second largest pot of reductions, $48 million, will come from a short-term change to Virginia’s standard deduction, the amount the government </span><a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2017/05/09/history-income-taxs-standard-deduction-more-interesting-than-you-think/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows people to subtract from their taxable income every year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to account for expenses and ease the tax burden without asking any questions. The higher the standard deduction is, the smaller the pool of income people have to pay taxes on — meaning that they end up paying less. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Gov. Glenn Youngkin has so far been unable to achieve the major tax cuts he’s pushed for during his time in the governor’s office, during his administration Virginia has greatly increased its standard deduction. The </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/01/after-months-of-wrangling-virginia-has-a-budget-deal-whats-in-it/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 budget deal raised the standard deduction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from $4,500 to $8,000 for individuals and from $9,000 to $16,000 for married couples, </span><a href="https://taxnews.ey.com/news/2022-1509-virginia-revised-income-tax-withholding-tables-and-formulas-apply-for-wages-paid-on-and-after-october-1-2022#:~:text=Under%20HB%2030%2C%20for%20tax,July%202022%20through%20December%202022." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">albeit with some restrictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The change was set to end in 2026, and the deductions would decrease slightly if state revenue growth didn’t hit certain targets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s deal will bump the standard deduction up to $8,500 for individuals and $17,000 for couples for the 2024 and 2025 tax years. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Teacher raises, more support jobs and learning loss dollars</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal includes $645 million in additional state funding for public education. Of that, almost $55 million will go toward the state’s share of an additional 2% salary increase for public school teachers expected to go into effect Jan. 1. When combined with an already planned 5% salary increase, the newest funding will result in an overall 7% salary bump for teachers over the pst two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over $152 million will go toward additional support and instructional positions. </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/2/SB6001/Introduced/1/138.10/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost $420 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will go toward “flexible one-time payments” to school divisions for learning loss recovery, operating and infrastructure support, and preparation for </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/38768/638063939944270000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the rollout of the Virginia Literacy Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which beginning in the 2024-25 school year will require stepped-up literacy instruction for Virginia students in kindergarten through fifth grade. Notably, the flexible payments will not require matching funds from districts, and each school division will receive at least $150,000. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Higher education</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia colleges and universities will get an additional $190 million, with $75 million earmarked to “support the growing need for student support services; address increased costs resulting from inflation; refine or create programs that meet current and future workforce needs; and minimize student costs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of that, the biggest allocations will be an extra $14.6 million to the Virginia Community College System, $10.4 million to Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond and $9.2 million to Virginia Tech. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another $62.5 million will go toward need-based undergraduate financial aid at public colleges and universities, and almost $5.8 million will go toward increased compensation for faculty at nursing schools to help stem nursing shortages. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">More enforcement of new hemp laws</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Virginia </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/01/hemp-retailers-start-seeing-big-fines-as-virginias-tougher-thc-law-takes-effect/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tightening up its rules about the contents and labeling of hemp products</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, lawmakers are again committing to funding new enforcement positions at the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last December, the Youngkin administration proposed roughly </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/26/youngkin-budget-envisions-15-person-team-for-revamped-hemp-oversight/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2.1 million in spending for a new hemp registration and inspection program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> staffed by 15 people. The current budget deal calls </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/2/SB6001/Introduced/1/104/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">for $1.1 million and 15 positions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for that purpose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, the deal </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/2/SB6001/Introduced/1/397/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decreases funding for the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this fiscal year while allowing the Department of Planning and Budget to transfer it up to $2.5 million “to cover one-time costs of a seed-to-sale tracking system.”  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mental health investments </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deal includes major investments in mental health infrastructure in line with Youngkin’s “Right Help, Right Now” plan </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/14/youngkin-proposes-230-million-behavioral-health-overhaul/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to overhaul the state’s beleaguered behavioral health system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In particular, it calls for $58 million to expand and modernize Virginia’s crisis services system, including spending on stabilization units and receiving centers, facilities intended to offer people undergoing a crisis more rapid and accessible treatment to care than is available at hospital emergency departments. An additional $10 million would go toward establishing mobile crisis services in underserved areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staff at community services boards, which provide local, community-based behavioral health and developmental disability services, will also get pay raises from an additional $18 million in spending. The expenditure is </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/30/as-virginia-budget-negotiations-drag-on-heres-what-hangs-in-the-balance/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than proposals made by both the House and the Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year, which called for an extra $37 million and $50 million, respectively. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36073" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/budgetnegots2-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36073 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/budgetnegots2-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1497" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/budgetnegots2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/budgetnegots2-300x175.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/budgetnegots2-1024x599.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/budgetnegots2-768x449.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/budgetnegots2-1536x898.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/budgetnegots2-2048x1198.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Budget negotiators Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, Del. Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach, and Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, in Richmond Aug. 23, 2023. (Sarah Vogelsong /Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than $5 million is also being proposed on a one-time basis for the Department of Criminal Justice Services </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/2/SB6001/Introduced/1/408/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to contract with local law enforcement agencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide transportation for or assume custody of people in crisis who have been placed under a temporary detention or emergency custody order but haven’t yet been admitted to a hospital. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State employee raises </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teachers aren’t the only ones poised to see bigger paychecks. The spending plan also includes $44 million in state employee raises that would go into effect Dec. 1 for state-supported local positions and Dec. 10 for state employees. Targeted increases would also be allocated for public defenders, deputy sheriffs, commonwealth’s attorneys, general district court clerks and others. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pollution cleanup: Big dollars for agricultural assistance</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of millions of dollars are earmarked for the state’s </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title10.1/chapter21.1/section10.1-2128/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water Quality Improvement Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a permanent fund created in 1997 to provide grants to local governments, soil and water conservation districts, state agencies, colleges and universities and others for pollution control and cleanup efforts. State law requires that 10% of annual state general fund revenues that are above official estimates and 10% of unrestricted and uncommitted general fund balances at the end of the fiscal year be deposited in the fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/2/SB6001/Introduced/1/374/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extra $286 million is designated for matching grants for farmers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who engage in agricultural best management practices, actions like installing fences or forested buffers around waterways to reduce water pollution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has tried to incentivize farmers to adopt such practices largely because of its commitments under the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement. About three-quarters of the remaining pollution reductions the state has to achieve under that agreement are expected to come from the agriculture sector. In recognition of that, the General Assembly allotted </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/29/record-funding-to-reduce-agricultural-pollution-expected-to-aid-bay-cleanup/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">record funding in 2022 to Virginia’s cost-share program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, with state and federal officials acknowledging that the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/12/chesapeake-bay-leaders-resolute-even-as-cleanup-targets-become-more-elusive/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2025 cleanup deadline isn’t likely to be met</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the legislature last session also </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/16/deal-reached-over-extension-for-va-farmers-to-adopt-pollution-reduction-practices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delayed state deadlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for farmers to voluntarily fence cattle out of streams until 2028 and tied that target to agricultural assistance funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big money is also headed for Virginia’s Enhanced Nutrient Removal Certainty Program, which was created in 2021 to speed up remaining wastewater treatment plant improvements to reduce pollution. The budget deal would put an extra $151 million toward that program, as well as an extra $30 million to a fund that provides assistance to local governments to deal with stormwater, another major source of pollution. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Community safety</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers are proposing a $10 million Safer Communities Program that would give Norfolk, Portsmouth and Richmond at least $2.5 million each to hire a full-time person to oversee community violence reduction strategies that “address the root causes and conditions” of community violence. A new Office of Safer Communities will also be created in the Department of Criminal Justice Services to serve as a hub for intervention efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/05/how-virginia-is-spending-new-state-funding-to-prevent-gun-violence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the state’s Operation Ceasefire Grant Program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an initiative modeled after a Boston project from the 1990s that focused on deterring young people and gangs from engaging in firearm violence, will get an additional $15 million.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Climate change resilience</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another $100 million under the deal is slated for the Resilient Virginia Revolving Loan Fund, a pool of money that was created in 2022 </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-looking-to-loans-for-local-flood-resiliency-efforts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to provide greater flexibility for the state to funnel assistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to both local governments and individual property owners impacted by flooding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration has been positioning the fund as an alternative to the Community Flood Preparedness Fund, which was created by Democrat-backed legislation in 2020 and funded with state revenues linked to Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a multistate carbon reduction program. The Flood Fund became Virginia’s first dedicated source of large-scale flood assistance for local governments, but Youngkin’s push to withdraw Virginia from RGGI has jeopardized the revenue stream the state has relied on for the past three years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, Youngkin proposed putting </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/15/buckle-up-youngkin-budget-proposal-includes-another-1b-in-tax-cuts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an additional $200 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the next two years into the Revolving Loan Fund. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Grants for more data center development</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, and the budget deal includes </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2023/2/SB6001/Introduced/1/113/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">up to $140 million in grants for “a data center operator”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1522" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the newly created Cloud Computing Cluster Infrastructure Grant Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The budget notes that the operator was approved for grant funding by the state’s Major Economic Investment Project Approval Commission on Dec. 13, 2022. In January, the Youngkin administration announced that Amazon Web Services plans to invest $35 billion in Virginia by 2040 “to establish multiple data center campuses across Virginia.” The release noted AWS would be eligible to receive an MEI grant of up to $140 million subject to approval by the General Assembly. </span></p>

<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Business-ready site spending</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has repeatedly emphasized the need for Virginia to increase the number and quality of sites it has available for major economic development projects. Officials have said Virginia’s lagging performance in the site readiness sphere have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/opinion/columnists/column-site-readiness-is-key-to-job-creation-in-va/article_8ddb063a-a350-11ed-84fe-9702173ae018.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">led to the loss of numerous big-ticket projects to other states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s budget deal would funnel an extra $125 million to the state’s Business Ready Sites Program Fund and $75 million to the new Business Ready Sites Acquisition Program and Fund “to expand Virginia’s portfolio of industrial properties for large-scale economic development projects.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A study of sports team relocation</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what appears to be a nod to the General Assembly’s on-again, off-again interest in luring the Washington Commanders to Virginia, the budget includes $250,000 for the Secretary of Finance to “develop relevant capabilities, conduct planning, and evaluate potential economic incentives to attract sports teams to the state.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commonwealth, the budget continues, “is prepared to consider economic development proposals that are in the best interest of Virginia taxpayers to assist in relocating sports teams and their associated facilities to the state.” </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia General Assembly will return to Richmond Sept. 6 to complete work on long-delayed amendments to the state budget following a </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/Special-Session-Writ_doc.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proclamation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Gov. Glenn Youngkin Tuesday evening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, I am calling Virginia’s lawmakers back to Richmond to reach a resolution on the state budget,” Youngkin said in a release. “Virginians deserve it. To make Virginia more affordable for families and local businesses, we must deliver on our shared goals for more jobs, safer and healthier communities, greater workforce and educational opportunities and much needed tax relief for Virginians.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article4/section6/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives the governor the power to call special sessions of the part-time legislature when he believes it is in “the interest of the Commonwealth.” The governor must convene a special session if two-thirds of both chambers request it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s proclamation follows an announcement by the Republican-controlled House and Democratic-controlled Senate last week that </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/25/virginia-budget-negotiators-announce-deal-on-tax-rebates-new-education-investments/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">negotiators had finally reached an agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on amendments to the state’s two-year budget after months of stalemate. </span></p>
<p><em>[<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/25/virginia-budget-negotiators-announce-deal-on-tax-rebates-new-education-investments/" target="_blank">Read more: Virginia budget negotiators announce deal on tax rebates, new education investments</a>]</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While details of the agreement remain scarce, a statement from the chief negotiators — Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, and Del. Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach — said the deal includes $200 tax rebates for individuals and $400 rebates for families, as well as increases in the standard deduction, a revival of the state tax holiday that lapsed and the removal of the age requirement for the military retiree subtraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Major investments in education and behavioral health are expected to be part of the budget package, which will outline plans on the spending of Virginia’s more than $3.6 billion surplus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly will convene in Richmond Sept. 6 at 10 a.m. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fight between a major health system in the Richmond and Hampton Roads regions and Virginia’s largest health insurer escalated Monday after Bon Secours Mercy Health&#8217;s Virginia operations filed a lawsuit against Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a complaint filed in Henrico Circuit Court, Bon Secours says Anthem has adopted “slow pay and no-pay tactics” in Virginia to avoid reimbursing the system more than $73 million for services in a timely fashion and improperly deny it more than $20 million in reimbursements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result, said Bon Secours, is “an enormous volume of BSMH Virginia claims being arbitrarily denied, downgraded and/or pended, thereby forcing BSMH Virginia to spend an inordinate number of hours responding to excessive and unreasonable requests for additional information, and undertaking extraordinary efforts to secure payment of properly payable claims for medically necessary care rendered to Anthem members.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a detailed filing, Bon Secours outlines several years of what it describes as Anthem’s failure to pay for services the hospitals provided. By the end of June 2023, the hospital system said it had identified 18,105 Virginia cases where it believed the insurer had either failed to provide reimbursement or erroneously denied it. Bon Secours says similar tactics by Anthem have led to $85 million in unpaid claims in its Ohio system and $6 million in its Kentucky system. </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Messy Bon Secours-Anthem dispute threatens to disrupt care for thousands of Virginians on Medicare&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/04/messy-bon-secours-anthem-dispute-threatens-to-disrupt-care-for-thousands-of-virginians-on-medicare/embed/#?secret=DYeJAXMEUi#?secret=u3YVWtWt4z" data-secret="u3YVWtWt4z" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bon Secours especially criticizes a new policy it said Anthem rolled out in October 2020 requiring a third-party vendor to assess select emergency department claims and adjusting its reimbursement framework. The hospital system said it objected to the change, which it says will allow the insurer to pay less for emergency services, but said it received no response from Anthem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthem has said it does not agree with the allegations in the lawsuit and calls it “another attempt to distract from Bon Secours’ decision to leave Anthem’s provider network and deny access to care for Medicaid and Medicare Advantage members.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the latest tactic in their efforts to demand double digit price increases from employers and individuals — in the middle of an active contract with Anthem,” said Kersha Cartwright, a spokesperson for Anthem parent company Elevance. “With these actions, they are closing off opportunities to work collaboratively, despite numerous requests to refocus the discussion and reach a solution.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hospital system and insurance company </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/04/messy-bon-secours-anthem-dispute-threatens-to-disrupt-care-for-thousands-of-virginians-on-medicare/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been fighting for months</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over reimbursement rates Anthem pays Bon Secours. On Aug. 1, roughly 11,000 Virginians who have Medicare Advantage plans through Anthem were affected by Bon Secours&#8217; departure from Anthem&#8217;s network, meaning they could no longer get services from the hospital system covered under favorable in-network prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a resolution isn’t reached by Oct. 1, another 39,000 Virginians who have managed Medicaid plans through Anthem could also find themselves out of network for Bon Secours, which has numerous medical facilities in Richmond, Newport News, Suffolk and Kilmarnock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthem has accused the hospitals of using Medicare and Medicaid patients as leverage in the broader dispute, which it says Bon Secours initiated by abruptly asking for a rate hike mid-contract. Bon Secours, in turn, has said Anthem’s reimbursement rates have not kept up with inflation or labor costs and that the company has engaged in “poor payment and contract practices,” including a pattern of backlogged and denied reimbursement payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the termination of the Medicare Advantage contract, Anthem last week sent a cease and desist letter to Bon Secours, which it said was wrongfully denying care to people with Medicaid and employer-sponsored insurance plans through Anthem. Bon Secours called the claims “unfounded and false,” </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/richmond/contract-dispute-between-anthem-and-bon-secours-escalates-insurance-company-files-cease-and-desist/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to WRIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthem declined to provide a copy of the letter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its Monday suit, Bon Secours said Anthem has retaliated against the hospital system for its role in the dispute by denying and more closely scrutinizing claims and requiring pre-payment reviews of all emergency room visit claims from Southern Virginia Medical Center in Emporia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In June 2023 alone, BSMH Virginia received requests to audit 672 accounts from Anthem for Emergency Department visits — by comparison to a range of 1 to 111 accounts in prior months during 2023,” Bon Secours wrote. “This drastic increase occurred in the same month as when BSMH Virginia sent its second demand letter seeking payment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartwright said that “as recently as last Thursday,” the insurer had reached out to Bon Secours about the Medicare Advantage termination and potential Medicaid termination on Oct. 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have not heard back,” she wrote. “We urge Bon Secours to engage in productive discussions instead of these unproductive tactics that continue to spread misinformation and put vulnerable populations at risk.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Bon Secours and Anthem have been under heightened scrutiny in Virginia in recent years. In September 2022, a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/health/bon-secours-mercy-health-profit-poor-neighborhood.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accused Bon Secours of using its low-income and under-resourced Richmond Community Hospital as a tool to tap large profits through a federal prescription drug program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this July, Virginia’s Bureau of Insurance </span><a href="https://richmond.com/anthem-settles-charge-for-300-000/article_35b28f65-0ab0-504d-a577-415fedadf8ff.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered Anthem to pay $300,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to settle findings that it hadn’t been paying claims within a 40-day window set by the state. The company told The Richmond Times-Dispatch the settlement “does not constitute, nor should be construed as an admission of any violation of law.” </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia budget negotiators announced Friday they have reached a deal on amendments to the state’s two-year budget, signaling an end to a months-long process that has delayed numerous state investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The deal is one that provides Virginians with additional tax relief and unprecedented investments in education, natural resources, and behavioral health,” said the Aug. 25 release from Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, and Del. Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach. “It is a win-win for the citizens of Virginia.” </span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia budget negotiators say deal likely by end of week&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/23/virginia-budget-negotiators-say-deal-likely-by-end-of-week/embed/#?secret=rRaqqV0SeI#?secret=yHgiTn1nHI" data-secret="yHgiTn1nHI" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the negotiators said they are still “completing the final touches” on the agreement, they said the final version will include a one-time tax rebate of $200 for individuals and $400 for families and increase the standard deduction to $8,500 for individuals and $17,000 for joint filers. It will also reinstate the state sales tax holiday, which </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/money/no-virginia-annual-sales-tax-holiday-2023/291-8c24a381-6e40-49d4-a959-8173901a0020" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawmakers allowed to lapse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and remove the age requirement for the military retiree subtraction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firm numbers weren’t provided for spending on state services, but Friday’s release noted the final budget will prioritize educational investments and provide additional operating support and financial aid to colleges and universities “to ensure access is not limited due to family income.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were able to negotiate these investments while maintaining an eye on Virginia’s continued budgetary integrity,” Howell, Barker and Knight wrote. “Virginia remains in a strong fiscal position based on these actions, which will continue to protect our triple-AAA bond rating.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following a Wednesday meeting of the money committees of the Democratic-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled House, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/23/virginia-budget-negotiators-say-deal-likely-by-end-of-week/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the budget negotiators said they expected to reach a deal Friday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s unusually long talks over changes to the biennial spending plan have been due to disagreements between Republicans and Democrats over how Virginia should spend its billions in surplus funds. While Republicans have pushed for longer-term tax cuts, Democrats have called for greater spending on state services like education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In July, negotiations </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/28/what-caused-virginias-budget-breakdown-accounts-differ/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appeared briefly to have broken down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over a dispute about the terms of a deal Republicans said had been made in February and Democrats denied had been firmly resolved. However, talks resumed later in the summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who will have to sign the final budget deal for it to go into effect, said he was “willing to accept” a compromise that rested on one-time tax relief and signaled he intends to push for more permanent cuts in future legislative sessions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Republicans and Democrats praised Friday’s announcement of a deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Todd Gilbert called the development “encouraging” and noted a special session will need to be called for both chambers to review the final agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re closer than ever before to providing real tax relief to Virginia families who are being squeezed by inflation and other skyrocketing costs, and providing historic levels of support for our schools,” he said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Democrats characterized the deal as a “budget victory,” emphasizing the Republican-controlled House’s initial plan calling for the corporate tax rate to be cut from 6% to 5%. Knight, the lead Republican negotiator, has </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/28/what-caused-virginias-budget-breakdown-accounts-differ/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously said that proposal was dropped in late February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The right course of action won today,” said House Minority Leader Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, in a statement. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This budget invests in our kids, not corporations, taking the commonwealth forward, and not backwards like the VA GOP are attempting to do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The signs of progress, which have followed months of on-again, off-again talks between budget leaders in the Democratic-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled House of Delegates, came as Gov. Glenn Youngkin urged the General Assembly to reach agreement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our course for the current budget is clear,” Youngkin told the joint money committees of both chambers in an address in Richmond Wednesday morning. “Please send me one.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with reporters after his speech, Youngkin said lawmakers needed to “move fast” to reach a deal, pointing out he will soon begin work on his proposal for the next two-year budget, which is traditionally presented to the committees in June. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eventually this just becomes a moment where we say, ‘You can’t reach a deal, fine. We’ll just take care of it in January,’” he said. “And that clock is ticking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, who along with Sen. George Barker is leading negotiations for Senate Democrats, said she was “quite sure we’re going to have a deal probably by the end of this week.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lead House negotiator Del. Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach, said all of the parties “concur on that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re all working as hard as we can on that. Nobody’s stalling anybody. We’re all getting along. We’re meeting. Last night it was well after 10 o’clock when we broke up,” he said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia operates on a two-year budget cycle, with lawmakers traditionally revising the plan in off years during the winter legislative session to account for not only changing fiscal circumstances, but also new legislation. This year’s extended budget impasse has left billions in surplus funds unallocated while also stalling other initiatives greenlit by the legislature, such as new positions to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/01/hemp-retailers-start-seeing-big-fines-as-virginias-tougher-thc-law-takes-effect/#:~:text=By%3A%20Graham%20Moomaw%20%2D%20August%201%2C%202023%204%3A33%20pm&amp;text=Several%20Virginia%20businesses%20have%20been,down%20on%20alternatives%20to%20marijuana." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enforce stricter rules on hemp products</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/27/uncertain-timetable-on-budget-puts-virginia-schools-in-tight-spot-on-hiring/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional teacher raises</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and major investments in the state’s struggling behavioral health system. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and Republicans have largely presented the disagreement as being over whether the surplus should go toward greater investments in state services like education or should be seen as an example of excess taxation and returned to residents through long-term tax cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, negotiators told </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/what-the-virginia-budget-deal-being-considered-would-include/article_3ceb3fba-4120-11ee-b23f-53f728b5053c.html#tracking-source=home-top-story?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/08/22/virginia-lawmakers-say-budget-deal-is-on-the-horizon-after-months-of-stalled-talks/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginian-Pilot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they may have reached a deal that would provide one-time tax rebates of $200 to individuals and $400 for companies as well as increases to the standard deduction and teacher raises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite that reporting, Howell, Knight and Barker on Wednesday would not confirm any of the terms of a potential agreement, saying only that they were close to a deal but had several unspecified “sticking points” to work out.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have the answers to your questions, we’re just not going to tell you right now until we have a finished product,” Knight told reporters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howell characterized the ongoing talks as “very productive and very cordial” and characterized some delays as due to legislators’ varied schedules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So many people have travel plans and vacation plans,” she said. “It’s hard to get everybody back, and that’s creating some consternation.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week’s apparent breakthrough followed a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/28/what-caused-virginias-budget-breakdown-accounts-differ/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public breakdown in talks in July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when Knight announced Democrats had “decided to abandon” a deal he said the parties had reached in February but decided to delay announcing due to the stiff primary challenge Barker was facing. (</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/20/aird-tops-morrissey-sturtevant-beats-chase-in-wild-virginia-primaries/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barker lost his primary in June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) Democrats in turn said there had never been a firm February agreement and that the Republicans had walked away from the table over their insistence on long-term tax cuts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about the potential deal reported by the Times-Dispatch that would provide one-time tax rebates instead of more permanent cuts, Youngkin said he thought it was “a moment where we’re going to come together around the reality that we can provide one-time tax relief in refunds but also begin to get at some of the more permanent tax relief.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m looking for a billion dollars in tax relief,” he said. “I know that we can afford permanent cuts, and if we take a moment here and provide the one-time tax relief and we move forward for permanent cuts next year, that’s a compromise that I’d be willing to accept.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as the housing market in Virginia has slowed, prices remain high statewide, researchers told the Virginia Housing Commission Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The theme is slow yet competitive,” said Ryan Price, chief economist for Virginia Realtors. “A lot of things are driving that, primarily the increase in interest rates, which has deterred both buyers and would-be sellers, but also our inventory, the lack of inventory that we have out there.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While new home construction in Virginia has continued to grow in 2022, building still lags levels seen in the state historically, said Hamilton Lombard, a demographer for the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the financial crisis of the late 2000s, “we were around 60,000 new homes annually,” he said. “We’re below 40,000 right now. … If you go back before that and look at the averages we had in the ’90s and ’80s, we were building about 50,000 new homes every year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Declines, however, aren’t even across Virginia. Data presented to the commission shows new home construction is down significantly in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads compared to a decade ago and continues to be low in the coalfields region of Southwest Virginia. In contrast, Richmond and smaller metropolitan areas in places like Halifax and Danville have seen upticks in activity. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36058" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:918px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Home-construc-trends.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-36058" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Home-construc-trends.jpg" alt="" width="918" height="631" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Home-construc-trends.jpg 918w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Home-construc-trends-300x206.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Home-construc-trends-768x528.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Virginia home construction trends. (Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Richmond has really been the one big standout area when you look at Virginia,” said Lombard. “It’s built a large number of homes in recent years. The numbers we have for 2022 are the highest we had in any of our records my office has collected going back to the 1980s.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, high interest rates are discouraging not only buyers but sellers. While the average interest rate on mortgages held by existing Virginia homeowners is 3.8%, the average interest rate for new mortgages is 6.4%, said Price, making many reluctant to move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The incentive to lose that 4%, 3%, 2.5% rate and get a 7% rate — there is no incentive unless you’re forced to move,” he said. “That spread is really deterring a lot of homeowners to list their homes.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, home sales have slowed. Between January and June of this year, sales statewide were down 24% compared to the same period last year. Data presented to the commission showed market activity declining in 90% of Virginia’s counties and cities, with the sharpest slowdowns seen in Spotsylvania, Franklin, Bedford and Rockingham counties and the city of Newport News. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously, Virginia home prices are trending upward in the majority of jurisdictions. Since 2018, Price found they have risen 36%, from an average statewide price of $285,000 in 2018 to $389,000 now. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36059" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1270px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36059 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices.jpg" alt="" width="1270" height="721" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices.jpg 1270w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices-300x170.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Housing-prices-768x436.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1270px) 100vw, 1270px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (Virginia REALTORS)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some regions, the uptick in remote work spurred by the pandemic appears to be exacerbating price hikes as higher-paid workers move from larger metropolitan areas to smaller ones where wages are lower. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we’ve seen in metro Richmond is that if you’re coming from the West Coast and making West Coast wages or you’re coming from Northern Virginia and D.C. making those wages, you’re coming into this region, folks who live here and are living with our wages are being beat out every time when they’re going for a purchase,” said commission member Laura Lafayette, who is also CEO of the Richmond Association of Realtors. “And they’re also being squeezed on the rents, because folks making D.C. wages can afford more rent.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While many of the trends Virginia is experiencing are playing out nationwide, Virginia home construction is lagging that of neighboring Tennessee and North Carolina. Lombard said Tennessee is building about a third more housing units than Virginia, while North Carolina is building double. Both have also seen far higher job growth than Virginia since January 2020, with Virginia adding 56,800 jobs, Tennessee 172,900 and North Carolina 284,500, according to Price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“North Carolina is kicking Virginia’s butt as far as job growth,” said Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, Tuesday. “And one of the main reasons they’re doing that, as we hear all the time, is North Carolina’s march to a zero tax rate for corporate. So they are going away from us. Tennessee’s the same situation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More affordable housing elsewhere may be a key driver of population losses from Virginia to more southern states, said Price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re building more housing in these states,” he said. “So the fact there are homes available, there are good jobs there, it is attracting a lot of folks away from Virginia. We also have good jobs here, but our housing is more expensive, particularly in the job centers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked by Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, if there was anything the state could do policywise to ease some of the housing pressures, Price said many solutions have emerged from local governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The places that have started to move the needle particularly on the supply side are really making strides at the local level moreso than the state level with respect to zoning changes — whether it be loosening up the zoning in some places, whether it be concentrating a lot of the new housing in specific corridors that are near transit, that are near job centers, whether it be making the process to densify in some cases easier, making the permit process easier,” he said. “But I also think there could be ways to incentivize local governments to do this type of work at the state level.”</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After several years of attention-grabbing reports on high eviction rates in Virginia, the state has begun collecting data on the number and location of evictions that occur over the course of a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The effort, which is being carried out by the Virginia courts that issue writs of eviction — the legal documents that authorize a local sheriff to evict someone — follows legislation that passed during the last General Assembly session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We hear a lot about an eviction tsunami and an eviction crisis, and it’s hard to get an idea of what the real scope of that is,” Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, told a House subcommittee this January. “This is just a data collection process we’re trying to get started here so that we can get our arms around how big of a problem, how big of an issue this is in the commonwealth.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since July 1, sheriffs have been required to return executed writs to the court that issued them so the state can systematically track evictions. Brandy Singleton, a senior attorney in the Supreme Court of Virginia’s Office of the Executive Secretary, told a Virginia Housing Commission work group Monday that the court system has also updated its case management system to capture that information.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What that will allow us to do is then run an annual report to see statewide how many of these are actually being executed and returned to the clerk’s office, and then that data in turn can be broken down by locality or a variety of other variables,” said Singleton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation requiring the data collection, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1836" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1836</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1089" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1089</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, was supported by the Virginia Apartment Management Association and the Apartment and Office Building Association. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measures passed both chambers with bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2018, researchers with </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/07/upshot/millions-of-eviction-records-a-sweeping-new-look-at-housing-in-america.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Princeton University’s Eviction Lab ranked five Virginia cities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — Richmond, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk and Chesapeake — among the top 10 municipalities with the highest eviction rates in the nation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators and policymakers scrambled for solutions. In 2019, the General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/3ace98069238435c9a8980c72d90eaca" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than half a dozen reforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intended to drive down eviction rates, including new requirements for written leases, longer periods for tenants to pay rent and fees to avoid eviction and the creation of an eviction diversion pilot. </span><a href="https://scholarship.richmond.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1555&amp;context=pilr" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other more tenant-friendly reforms followed in 2020 and 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

(Transurban) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten more miles of express lanes on Interstate 95 near Fredericksburg, Virginia will open to traffic Thursday night, making the roughly 50-mile stretch between the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers the nation’s longest reversible road, according to transportation officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This 10-mile segment is known to be among the most congested in the nation,” said Mike Discenza, acting president of express lane operator Transurban North America, during a ribbon cutting ceremony Wednesday.  With over 150,000 vehicles traveling the corridor on average daily, morning rush hour speeds often fall to under 20 miles per hour, he said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36004" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:260px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Express-lanes-map.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-36004 size-medium" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Express-lanes-map-260x300.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Express-lanes-map-260x300.jpg 260w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Express-lanes-map.jpg 626w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (Expresslanes.com)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designed to combat that congestion, Virginia’s I-95 express lanes require drivers to pay tolls linked to current traffic loads, which are assessed every 10 minutes. When traffic is light, tolls are low, with costs rising as congestion increases. Traffic loads also dictate the direction of the road, which can be reversed depending on whether northbound or southbound flows are more sluggish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can actually change directions and make sure that we are customizing to the flow of traffic,” said Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not subject to the fees: buses, carpoolers and motorcycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Transportation and Transurban, which have been working on the $670 million project since 2019 through a public-private partnership, have estimated the extension will add 66% more traffic capacity to Interstate 95 during peak periods and could save drivers up to 35 minutes in travel time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Secretary of Transportation Shep Miller called the extension “the biggest investment … in I-95 in the region since the interstate was widened from three lanes in the 1980s.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work is a little less than a year behind schedule and above its initial cost estimate of $565 million. Originally intended to be done by October 2022, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2021/12/20/virginia-express-lanes-fredericksburg-delayed/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a dispute over soil conditions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Transurban and contractors Branch Civil and Flatiron Construction, delayed completion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transurban has a long history in Virginia, where it began operating toll lanes along Interstates 95 and 495 more than a decade ago. The Fredericksburg extension was negotiated as part of a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/02/01/how-virginias-billion-deal-with-transurban-came-about-solved-major-i-bottleneck/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1 billion deal between the company and Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019.</span></p>

(Richard Vogelsong for the Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that wine shippers who buy wine from different wineries that then box and ship orders on to Virginia customers must get a state license for every location involved in the chain. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/0973222.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overturns an earlier ruling by Richmond Circuit Court that found California-based company VinoShipper only needed a state license for its home office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VinoShipper engages in what’s known as drop-shipping — a practice where a company doesn’t keep inventory in its own warehouse but instead contracts with third parties to fulfill orders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In VinoShipper’s case, when customers buy wine through the company’s website, it verifies they are 21 or older and that their order doesn’t violate any state laws governing how much wine can be shipped to them. (Virginia law only authorizes wine shippers to send a Virginian up to two cases of wine per month.) It then buys the selected wine from the winery, sends it a shipping label and a state-required notice that someone 21 or older must receive the delivery and directs UPS to pick up the shipment from the winery and deliver it to the customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following “inquiries from other licensees” about VinoShipper’s business model, ABC has argued that because state law requires shippers to obtain a separate license for “each separate place” where business occurs, VinoShipper must get licenses for every place that selects, boxes and transfers packages to UPS on its behalf. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VinoShipper, however, contended shipping is a “process” rather than a single act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company “insists that the only legally significant step in that process is when VinoShipper tells UPS to pick up the shipment from the winery for delivery to the customer in Virginia,” the appeals court Judge Stuart A. Raphael wrote. “And because VinoShipper directs that activity (and all other activities) from its office in Windsor, California, it says that the ‘shipping’ takes place there and there alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court rejected that argument Tuesday, ruling the company was violating state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shipping,” Raphael wrote, includes “(1) receiving the customer’s order; (2) purchasing the wine from the wineries; (3) selecting and packing the wine in boxes for shipment; (4) affixing the shipping and over-21 labels; and (5) tendering the package to UPS for delivery to the customer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That VinoShipper delegates the third, fourth, and fifth steps to the wineries does not mean that VinoShipper does not perform those essential selling and shipping functions; it just does them through entities without their own Virginia license, using those entities’ employees,” he continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Raphael noted VinoShipper “may have developed an innovative and efficient wine-shipping model that is ideal for a ‘just-in-time digital economy,’” he concluded “that model does not currently comply with Virginia law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The General Assembly has amended the ABC Act to account for technological innovations,” he said. “Whether the ABC Act should be amended again to accommodate VinoShipper’s business model is the General Assembly’s choice, not ours.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposed federal rules to bring the amount of silica to which coal and mineral miners can be exposed on the job in line with standards for other occupations are poised to provide protections for workers after years of urging by medical and black lung organizations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while those groups have hailed the change as a long-overdue step that could help curb </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/new-study-finds-central-appalachian-miners-at-highest-risk-of-dying-from-lung-diseases/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Appalachia’s sharpest rise in cases of the most severe type of black lung</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in decades, many of their members say the proposal lacks meaningful enforcement measures and relies too heavily on mining companies to conduct testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current proposal states that you are relying on mine operators to collect their own baseline samples and to conduct periodic sampling if exposures are above the action threshold,” said Dr. Drew Harris, medical director of the Black Lung Program at Stone Mountain Health Services in Lee County, during a hearing on the proposal held by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in Arlington Aug. 3. “I cannot believe that relying on the current system of depending on mine operator dust sampling and scheduled MSHA inspection is going to end the current black lung epidemic.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MSHA Deputy Assistant Secretary for Operations Pat Silvey pushed back, saying that “in appropriate cases” the federal agency takes action against mine operators violating federal rules. Furthermore, she said, “Anybody in this room knows this who represents mine operators: All our inspections are unannounced.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Harris conceded the agency has prosecuted some operators, he said reports of “dishonest or dangerous practices” from patients at his facility, Virginia’s only federally funded black lung clinic, are “rampant.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is far underappreciated how often this is happening,” he said, adding: “I appreciate that your inspections are unannounced, but it is curious to me how our patients describe to me how ventilation changes the day before the inspections happen. … Somewhere in the process, someone is aware that this is happening.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/silica/default.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silica dust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a byproduct of both coal and non-coal mining, produced when workers cut or drill through minerals like quartz. When inhaled over time, it causes severe respiratory diseases such as lung cancer, emphysema, silicosis and coal worker’s pneumoconiosis, more commonly known as black lung. Each of these, MSHA notes, is “chronic, irreversible, and potentially disabling or fatal.” </span></p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/new-study-finds-central-appalachian-miners-at-highest-risk-of-dying-from-lung-diseases/</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between roughly 1968 and the turn of the millennium, rates of the most severe and advanced form of black lung, progressive massive fibrosis, fell. But in 2014, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4214114/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">researchers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detected a sharp uptick in PMF among coal miners in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29411024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further</span></a> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/new-study-finds-central-appalachian-miners-at-highest-risk-of-dying-from-lung-diseases/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have confirmed soaring rates of black lung among Central Appalachian miners, many of whom reach advanced stages of the disease earlier than doctors recorded in prior decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coal miners in central Appalachia are disproportionately affected with as many as 1 in 5 having evidence of black lung — the highest level recorded in 25 years,” the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), an agency within the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/updates/upd-07-20-18.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted in 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The uptick is evident in mining areas, some residents say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now you’re seeing these guys in their 30s,” said Vonda Robinson, vice president of the National Black Lung Association and a resident of Nickelsville in Virginia’s Scott County whose husband was diagnosed with black lung eight years ago. “They still have small children at home.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One former Virginia miner, who suffers from black lung after 37 years in the industry and asked not to be identified, said he believes many miners have long contracted black lung earlier than reported. He said, many avoid chest X-rays and other forms of detection for fear of losing high-paying work until they are older and ready to transition out of the field. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most people wait until they quit work,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silica exposure may be higher in Central Appalachia now because many of the easily accessible big seams of coal have been mined out, requiring workers to cut far more rock to access deposits, he hypothesized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can tell after so many years you start to breathe a little heavier and are slowing down,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Differing exposure limits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, the federal government has set different standards for how much silica exposure is allowed for miners and people working in other occupations. In 2016, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, set a permissible exposure limit of 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air for workers in non-mining sectors like construction, maritime and general industry. The 50 microgram limit had previously been recommended by NIOSH.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mine Safety and Health Administration, however, stuck with its decades-old standard of 100 micrograms per cubic meter. The administration’s lack of action came despite a January 2010 letter from Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy Gregory Wagner </span><a href="https://aclc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ACLC_Silicapetition_July2021.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stating that MSHA intended to publish a proposed silica standard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for miners by April 2011.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, </span><a href="https://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/2021/05-21-001-06-001.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an audit by the U.S. Department of Labor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Office of Inspector General found MSHA’s silica exposure limit was “out of date,” its sampling “may be too infrequent” and it is unable to cite and fine operators solely on the basis of exposures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A significant body of evidence shows that lowering the silica limit would be a major factor in preventing coal workers’ deaths and illnesses caused by silica exposure,” the audit found. “Even though MSHA has known its silica limit did not align with current scientific recommended limits, it continued to maintain essentially the same limit established in the 1960s.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This June, the administration released a proposed rule that would not only lower the silica exposure limit to the 50 micrograms in place for other sectors but also set that limit separate from rules imposed for coal dust and require far more frequent three-month sampling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Mining Association doesn’t oppose the 50 microgram exposure limit, said Paul Krivokuca, the group’s vice president of health and safety, at the Arlington hearing this August. But like other industry representatives, Krivokuca said mine operators need more time than a 45-day public comment period to analyze the new rules. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The issues raised in this proposed rule are very complex,” he told MSHA officials. “The current comment period is simply insufficient to provide meaningful comment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Industry members also raised concerns about whether the testing infrastructure exists to support the administration’s more demanding sampling schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based on MSHA’s assessment of how many samples will need to be analyzed, the labs will not be able to handle the increase in sampling demand,” said attorney and mining engineer Michael Peelish. Hunter Prillaman of the National Lime Association questioned “whether there is sufficient laboratory and testing consultant availability to perform so much baseline testing shortly after the effective date of the final rule.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One particularly thorny point for several industry groups was MSHA’s decision to only allow operators to rely on respirators to meet exposure limits on a temporary rather than permanent basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“OSHA provides for the use of respirators for compliance purposes,” said Peelish. “If it’s good for OSHA, then why not for MSHA?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miners’ groups like the United Mine Workers of America have argued respirators are ill suited for long-term use in the harsh and demanding environment of mines and can seriously hamper communication in dangerous underground settings where workers must be aware of risks like roof falls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even appropriate use of personal protective equipment poses many challenges for miners, who often work in extreme conditions,” said Gary Ewart, a spokesman for the American Thoracic Society, a medical group that focuses on lung and respiratory health. Engineering controls, he said, “are the best and preferred method of controlling miner exposure to silica dust.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, of the Stone Mountain clinic, also pushed back against the idea of using respirators on a more permanent basis, saying that in his view, the equipment “should not even be a temporary solution.” Because MSHA’s rule does not define how long “temporary” use of respirators can last, he said, operators could potentially sidestep needed controls for months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sharpest criticisms of the new standards, however, have focused on their reliance on mine operators to conduct the sampling that will serve as the basis for assessments of worker safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why come out with such a good rule and not have the enforcement?” Robinson asked. Allowing companies rather than inspectors to spearhead testing, she added, “is really a slap in the face.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Arlington hearing, Matt Stewart, a certified industrial hygienist who also works for a mine operator and serves on NIOSH’s Mine Safety Health and Research Advisory Committee, said operators he knows “do not cheat.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sure there are examples of mine operators who do, so for the record, the mine operators I know, the mine I work for would find that offensive,” he said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Ewart during his comments said numerous doctors who treat miners with lung diseases besides Harris have reported stories “describing how mine operators intentionally take and report dust samples that explicitly mask actual exposure levels, including placing monitors in front of air vents, collecting dust samples on non-typical days like when dust producing machinery is not in operation and conducting dust monitoring samples for outdoor mine operations on days with heavy rain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The [American Thoracic Society] cannot independently verify these claims of dust sampling manipulation, nor do we know how widespread these practices might be,” he said, “but they do demonstrate how vulnerable the system of dust sampling and reporting is to manipulation.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new contract, which was announced Friday, will be effective through July 31, 2025. Under its terms, Chesapeake Regional will remain in the Cigna coverage network.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Chesapeake Regional Healthcare President and CEO Reese Jackson said he was “very satisfied that our efforts have resulted in mutually beneficial terms.” Cigna Healthcare Vice President of Contracting and Network Management Elizabeth Malley-Lowe said the insurer was “pleased to reach agreement with Chesapeake Regional to continue providing quality, affordable in-network care to our customers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disagreements this spring between the two organizations over the rates at which Cigna would reimburse Chesapeake Regional for services nearly led to the termination of their existing contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had that occurred, it could have meant thousands of Cigna-insured people in Hampton Roads would no longer have gotten lower in-network rates for health services provided through Chesapeake Regional. Instead, they would have had to pay higher rates or find other medical providers still in Cigna’s network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tricia Hardy, a spokeswoman for the hospital system, said the agreement had been reached without any interruptions in service for patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as the hospital system and insurer reached a deal Friday, <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/04/messy-bon-secours-anthem-dispute-threatens-to-disrupt-care-for-thousands-of-virginians-on-medicare/" target="_blank">a separate dispute between Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield and Bon Secours Mercy Health</a> has left 11,000 Virginians with Anthem-managed Medicare Advantage plans out of network for Bon Secours, which operates numerous hospitals in the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an agreement is not reached by Oct. 1, an additional 39,000 Virginians who have Medicaid coverage through an Anthem-managed plan will also fall out of Bon Secours’ network.  </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A messy contract dispute between Bon Secours Mercy Health and Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield has left 11,000 Virginians who have Medicare plans through Anthem out of network for Bon Secours, which operates numerous hospitals in the Richmond and Hampton Roads regions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the disagreement isn’t resolved by Oct. 1, an additional 39,000 Virginians who get Medicaid coverage through Anthem could also find themselves out of network, potentially facing disruption to their ability to get health care. </span><a href="https://www.limaohio.com/top-stories/2023/07/28/mercy-health-anthem-dispute-leaves-medicaid-patients-in-bind/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of low-income people with managed Medicaid plans through Anthem in Ohio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already are unable to get their care covered at Bon Secours Mercy Health facilities in that state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An entire health system going out of network doesn’t just impact the hospital,” said Sara Cariano, deputy director of the Center for Healthy Communities with the Virginia Poverty Law Center. “We want folks to be able to access care when they need it, particularly the most vulnerable.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthem has accused Bon Secours Mercy Health of using Medicare and Medicaid patients as leverage in an effort to force the insurer to increase its reimbursement rates for services provided to Anthem customers with employer-sponsored or Affordable Care Act plans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The insurance giant said the two had entered into a new three-year contract in January 2022 that included annual payment increases for Bon Secours. But it claims that in late 2022, the hospital system asked for double-digit rate increases. Following the failure of negotiations, Bon Secours then exercised a termination provision allowing it to end in-network coverage for patients with managed Medicare Advantage plans through Anthem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anthem and Bon Secours signed a mutually agreed upon provider contract with annual increases to address inflation and labor costs just 18 months ago,” Anthem’s parent company, Elevance Health, said in a statement. “That contract is what Bon Secours is now asking to renegotiate using Virginia’s vulnerable populations as leverage.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bon Secours has argued that the rates paid by Anthem under its current contract are “substantially less” than those paid by other insurers and “have not kept up with inflation or labor costs” while accusing the insurance company of “doubl[ing] down on poor payment and contract practices.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anthem has continued to demonstrate a lack of awareness regarding the real-world challenges faced by providers and our communities in the current economic environment,” said Emma Swann, a spokesperson for Bon Secours, in an email. “Our increases from Anthem today are far less than a quarter of current inflation, and Bon Secours has limited our recent increase request to fall materially below current inflation in recognition of our responsibility to be financial stewards for our community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hospital system also says the insurer owes it “more than $100 million in late and unpaid claims.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are quite simply unable to sustainably further our mission of caring when Anthem leaves us to absorb the cost of care they refuse to pay,” said Swann.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthem says the $100 million figure is “inflated.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If no resolution between the two parties can be reached by the end of September, the dispute is poised to extend to low-income Virginians who have Medicaid plans through Anthem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those members become out of network at Bon Secours, they will have to look for care from a provider that remains in network or ask the state to change their plan to one that continues to contract with Bon Secours. While state law limits Medicaid plan enrollment to the 90-day open enrollment window, it provides certain exceptions for people to switch plans midway through their coverage, including a “lack of access to network providers experienced in dealing with the member’s health care needs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Gelfand, CEO and president of the ERISA Industry Committee, a group that represents roughly 100 of the nation’s largest companies in regard to the health and retirement benefits they are required to provide under federal law, called the dispute “bizarre.” Both the disagreement’s timing in the middle of an ongoing contract and the impact on Medicare and Medicaid enrollees are unusual, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a new kind of negotiating tactic. It’s one I haven’t seen used before,” he said, warning that “if the insurance company was to cave to the demands of the hospital system, it would mean everyone on private insurance would pay more.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous hospitals in Virginia in recent years have argued insurance companies aren’t paying them sufficient reimbursement rates given increasing labor, drug and supply costs. The American Hospital Association earlier this year said </span><a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/providers/pandemic-era-medicare-pay-increases-do-not-come-close-covering-hospitals-175-expense" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hospital expenses rose 17.5% between 2019 and 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Hampton Roads, Cigna and Chesapeake Regional Medical Center have been </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/19/contract-dispute-threatens-relationship-between-cigna-and-chesapeake-hospital/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">locked in negotiations over rates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this spring and summer. Anthem also previously had rate disputes with the </span><a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/augusta-health-gathers-community-support-contract-dispute-anthem" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fishersville-based Augusta Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which led to a short-term disruption in coverage, as well as </span><a href="https://www.rappnews.com/news/health/anthem-of-virginia-could-end-insurance-relationship-with-valley-health/article_1c0745c4-04f5-11eb-ac9f-b3bee49ff898.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valley Health in the Shenandoah Valley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia approaches the 2023 elections, all 140 seats in the House of Delegates and Senate are up for grabs, with a wave of retirements ushering in a field of new candidates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of those older delegates and senators were set in their ways and had been influenced by lobbyists for the pharmaceutical companies,” said Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, who has pledged to carry legislation in the Senate to establish the board and is favored to win his </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/state-senate-7/elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strongly Republican Southside Virginia district</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this November. “Big Pharma has given a lot of donations to delegate and senator candidates over the years, and certainly that plays a part in this, unfortunately.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in 2024, he said, he expects to see “a bunch of new freethinking people” in the House and Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have great hope that the new General Assembly in 2024 is going to be constituent oriented in its thinking and not lobbyist oriented in its thinking, and therefore we’re going to get a lot of great things that maybe we wouldn’t have been able to get done before, including this prescription board,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposals for Virginia to create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board that would have the power to review and in some cases set upper price limits on widely used prescription drugs were put forward in 2022 and 2023 by Sen.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critical opposition to the proposal came from Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, which decried it as too “wide-reaching.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t think a part-time board should regulate this industry,” Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Resources James Williams </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/16/house-panel-kills-prescription-drug-affordability-board-proposal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told a House subcommittee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during a January hearing. “It’s a very sophisticated and complicated industry, and health insurers will tell you they spend a lot of time looking at the value of these medicines.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked Tuesday whether the administration continues to oppose a Prescription Drug Affordability Board, Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter said “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the governor will review the legislation if it comes to his desk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a press conference held earlier in the day, Virginia AARP said a </span><a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/topics/health/prescription-drugs/virginia-prescription-drug-survey-2023.doi.10.26419-2Fres.00710.001.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">survey of 1,000 Virginia registered voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted in June by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University found three-quarters supported the creation of an affordability board &#8220;to help reduce what people pay for drugs in Virginia&#8221; by evaluating drug costs and setting limits on how much certain payers like state agencies pay for prescriptions. Support was found among Democrats, Republicans and independents alike.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sixty percent of respondents also said they would be &#8220;more likely&#8221; to vote for a candidate &#8220;who supported legislation that would create a Prescription Drug Affordability Board (to help reduce the prices that people pay for drugs in Virginia).&#8221; Six percent said they would be &#8220;less likely&#8221; to vote for such a candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This survey should show every candidate running for the General Assembly this fall that supporting a Prescription Drug Affordability Board is a commonsense bipartisan way to win voters to their side,” said State AARP Director Jim Dau. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delaney, who is running for a reliably blue Northern Virginia seat and plans to carry legislation in the House again next session, said the board “is going to be a tremendously important issue this election year and as we go into our legislative session next year.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any proposals, however, will face steep resistance from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, which have argued a board with review and price oversight powers will have a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/03/senate-oks-drug-affordability-board-bill-opposed-by-youngkin-administration/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“chilling effect” on investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia’s drug research and development industry. They also say the proposal overlooks other parts of the medication supply chain that drive up costs, including middlemen. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Virginians widely reject measures that put government bureaucrats between them and their doctors,&#8221; said Stami Williams, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, the trade group for the pharmaceutical industry. &#8220;Instead of politically appointed boards, AARP and other Virginia legislators should be looking at solutions that will lower costs at the pharmacy counter without risking people&#8217;s access to medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams pointed to the findings of a <a href="https://phrma.org/-/media/Project/PhRMA/PhRMA-Org/PhRMA-Refresh/Report-PDFs/P-R/PhRMA_50-state-poll_National-Memo_41123_final.pdf" target="_blank">different poll</a> conducted by business intelligence company Morning Consult on behalf of PhRMA in Virginia that found 60% of respondents &#8220;oppose drug price setting policies, such as prescription drug affordability boards (PDAB), once they learn more information on the policies and are presented with tradeoffs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tradeoffs listed were the potential of boards to &#8220;limit people&#8217;s access to newer prescription medicines,&#8221; &#8220;lead to less research and development of new medicines, including for cancer and rare diseases&#8221; and &#8220;put the government and unelected bureaucrats between patients and their medicines.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, Stanley called the argument that an affordability board would dampen investment “malarkey.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is the old corporate saying that has kept governments out of trying to regulate the prescription drug business in a financial way that is good for the consumer,” he said, comparing the industry to the state’s electric utilities, which are overseen by regulators who approve the companies’ profit levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These drug companies have been getting an almost unreasonable amount of return,” said Stanley. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delaney contended an affordability board would add necessary transparency to drug pricing that will still allow companies to charge high prices for medications if they are justified by research and development needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come to the table and let us know where the money is coming from, where it’s going and how we’re reaching these astronomical prices,” she said. “If there’s justification, the board will see it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous studies, including a </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/prices-increased-faster-than-inflation-for-half-of-all-drugs-covered-by-medicare-in-2020/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaiser Family Foundation analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a </span><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/d850985c20de42de984942c2d8e24341/price-tracking-brief.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report from the U.S. Health and Human Services Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have shown that drug price increases have outstripped inflation in recent years. In Virginia, the </span><a href="https://sharepoint.wwrc.net/vdaBoards/council/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BEF4206BD-E3CB-46A6-BED5-A12137CDB082%7D&amp;file=Annual%20Report%202022.pdf&amp;action=default" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonwealth Council on Aging last September reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that while average income in Virginia rose almost 17% between 2015 and 2019, annual prescription drug costs rose by more than 26% over the same period. </span></p>
<p>Dr. Rommaan Ahmad, a sports medicine and pain management physician from Alexandria who also serves as the Virginia lead for the Committee to Protect Health Care, said rising drug prices can also limit the tools doctors have at their disposal to treat patients with constrained resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, we&#8217;re trying to get away from things like opioids. But on the other hand, that&#8217;s still the cheapest treatment,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Almost anything we try seems to be much more expensive than that, so we&#8217;re sort of stuck in this weird loop where we&#8217;re trying to limit opioids and telling our patients not to take them, or cut back anyway, but at the same time we&#8217;re not really offering great alternatives because they&#8217;re too expensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stanley said in his Southside Virginia district, too many people are forced to choose between paying for prescription medication and paying for food or rent.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a gap in Virginians that are not eligible for Medicaid but don’t have insurance that will defray or at least reduce the cost of that prescription drug in any meaningful way,” said Stanley. “A lot of times Republicans and conservatives might say, ‘Well, this is government interference in the free market system.’ I say no. Because we’re talking about … a matter of life and death.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley said he would “do whatever I can to make sure our Republican friends in both the House and the Senate get behind us.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because if we don’t do this now, when will it get done?” he asked. “And if we don’t do it now, what will be the consequences to those Virginians who we have let down? That will be on us.” </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two major Virginia community banks, the Richmond-headquartered Atlantic Union and Danville-based American National, are merging, the institutions’ leaders announced Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a press call, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">John C. Asbury, president and CEO of Atlantic Union</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, called the merger “the culmination of a long friendship between the two companies” and “a very logical expansion,” while American National President and CEO Jeff Haley described it as being “like cousins going into business together.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlantic Union, which began in Bowling Green in Caroline County in 1902, currently has 109 branches in Virginia and is the fourth-largest bank in the state, according to information provided by the institution. American National, founded in 1907, has 26 branches throughout Southside Virginia and North Carolina and is the 16th-largest bank in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Asbury and Haley described the merger, through which Atlantic Union will acquire American National, as a response to changes in customer behavior accelerated by the pandemic, including increased demand for digital banking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s been a massive digital transformation in the banking industry,” said Haley. “I believe that the model of what we do as a $3 billion community bank has changed. … The foot traffic in our branches is down considerably since COVID.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a press release based on financial data from June 30, the new company will have $23.7 billion in total assets, $19.1 billion in total deposits and $17.3 billion in gross loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asbury said the two banks’ “combined footprint” will position the business “as an even stronger competitor against the large national, super-regional and smaller community banks.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The merger will still need approval from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions. Asbury said the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The banks are currently assessing branch locations to identify overlaps. Asbury said so far only a few cases have been found where Atlantic Union and American National branches are in close proximity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where that is the case obviously it makes no sense to have two branches operating,” he said. However, he continued, “we think branch impacts will be fairly limited.” </span></p>

(Skyhobo / Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to amend a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pair of obscure aviation rules</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capping flights at Northern Virginia’s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport foundered last week in the U.S. House of Representatives, although a group backing the change says “the fight is far from over.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/24/federal-aviation-bill-passed-by-u-s-house-with-boost-for-smaller-airports/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. House rejected an amendment to a bill reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — the government agency that oversees all civil aviation in the U.S. — that would have allowed seven new round-trip flights to Reagan National every hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most of the country’s airports are free to make their own decisions about the number of flights they field, a 1969 regulation put limits on five high-traffic airports in an effort to reduce congestion. Under the so-called</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/02/why-groups-are-fighting-over-obscure-1960s-era-slot-and-perimeter-rules-at-a-virginia-airport/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> slot rule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, airlines have to obtain an authorization for every takeoff from or landing at those airports, with Reagan National’s slots currently capped at 67 per hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, a separate regulation known as the perimeter rule limits the distance of nonstop flights to and from Reagan to 1,250 miles, with some exceptions subsequently passed by Congress. That limitation, also instituted in the 1960s, was intended to encourage more long-distance travel at the then-young Dulles International Airport in Loudoun and western Fairfax County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pushes to increase the number of slots at Reagan National and relax the perimeter rule have arisen roughly every five years when Congress debates FAA reauthorization. But this cycle has seen a more unified effort to alter the status quo by a business group called the Capital Access Alliance, a coalition that includes Delta Air Lines. Over the past few months, the CAA has launched a blizzard of op-eds and other messaging to persuade Congress to get rid of what it describes as an outdated system that drives up ticket prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is still strong bipartisan support in both houses for bringing more competition and lowering prices for consumers in air travel to the nation’s capital,” the group wrote the day after the U.S. House rejected the slot amendment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the loss, CAA spokesperson Brian Walsh said the coalition still believes it has a chance at passing the amendment, a scaled-down version of an earlier proposal that would have allowed an extra 28 trips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Attention now shifts to the Senate,” said Walsh, who added that “a number of members of the Senate Commerce Committee” had indicated they would support the amendment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not among them are Virginia’s senators, Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, who along with every other member of the state’s congressional delegation oppose the proposal on the grounds that Reagan National is already overstretched and adding new slots would make service at the busy airport worse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ll continue fighting these changes — which would exacerbate delays and ruin folks’ travel plans — as we consider this legislation in the Senate soon,” Warner said in a tweet following the 205-229 vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This strong bipartisan vote of opposition should make it clear, as the Senate takes up their own FAA authorization, that proposals to weaken [Reagan’s] slot and perimeter rules do not have majority support in the Congress,” said U.S. Rep. Don Beyer, D-Alexandria, in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority, which manages both Reagan and Dulles, and local officials in Northern Virginia have also been outspoken in their opposition to the changes. Fairfax County’s Board of Supervisors </span><a href="https://www.ffxnow.com/2023/05/24/fairfax-county-board-opposes-push-for-longer-flights-at-national-airport/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sent a letter to the Senate Commerce committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this spring, arguing the addition of more flights would cause air traffic problems and increase regional flight noise. Arlington County’s board adopted </span><a href="https://www.arlingtonva.us/files/sharedassets/public/county-board/documents/misc/arlington-county-dca-resolution.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that among other concerns said the amendment would increase Reagan’s “overcrowded conditions and degrade its operating performance.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite some local upticks in animal rabies reports, Virginia health officials said cases in the commonwealth this year are in line with averages from the past decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While local health department statistics may vary and some localities may experience a series of rabies oriented events in quick succession, currently, from a statewide standpoint, we are reporting average levels of laboratory confirmed rabid animals,” said State Public Health Veterinarian Julia Murphy in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the Virginia Department of Health, roughly 3,000 animals in the state are tested for rabies annually. Over the past decade, an average of 9.5% to 13.8% of those animals tested positive for the disease every year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of the beginning of June, VDH had tested 1,472 animals for rabies this year, with 10.5% testing positive, said Murphy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Exposure reports typically increase in the warmer months since people and their pets are outside more and more likely to contact wildlife,” said Murphy. “By extension, animal testing for rabies typically increases in May, June, July and August. Sometimes that is when rabies, which is in circulation in wildlife year round, can become more ‘noticeable,’ if you will, and there is greater rabies awareness.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the statewide average remains in the normal range, some parts of the state — like the Chickahominy Health District, which covers a swathe of rural central Virginia outside Richmond — have seen localized upticks in cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between Jan. 1 and June 13 of this year, the Chickahominy district had 243 reports of bites or exposures and 10 confirmed cases of rabies. Over the same period of 2022, the district also had 243 reports of bites or exposures but only five confirmed cases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caitlin Hodge, a population health manager with the district, said the higher figure may be due to greater amounts of reporting and testing rather than a greater prevalence of the virus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“More rabies testing has been done compared to this time last year,” Hodge said in an email. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean there is more rabies in the animal population in our area.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past few years, the largest number of confirmed cases in animals have occurred in Fairfax County, followed by Loudoun.</span></p>

    </div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kirsten Kohl, a rabies specialist with the Fairfax County Health Department, said in an email that Fairfax’s count of rabies-positive animals is generally higher because the county is Virginia’s most populous, accounting for about 14% of the state population. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In 2020, VDH reported 47 rabid animals in Fairfax County and 329 rabid animals total in the state, meaning Fairfax accounted for about 14.3% of the rabid animals in the state that year — on par with our population,” she wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raccoons have accounted for the majority of Fairfax’s positive cases in recent years. Kohl said the relocation of raccoons from Florida into Virginia in the 1950s led to a sharp increase in “raccoon-variant rabies” in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Raccoons are typically very adaptable animals and adjust well to urban and suburban environments,” she said. “Additionally, rapid urbanization directly causes habitat fragmentation, causing existing large animal habitats to be broken into small, isolated patches, and forcing many animals to adapt to live among humans more and more.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That species, along with skunks and foxes, are the most common carriers of rabies in Virginia. However, Murphy cautioned that any mammal, including humans, can become infected from the disease, which is almost 100% fatal once symptoms appear. Since 2009, the state has seen</span> <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/epidemiology/epidemiology-fact-sheets/rabies/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only two human rabies cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the very most important ways you can protect yourself and your pets is by having your veterinarian vaccinate your pets for rabies and keeping their vaccinations up to date,” she wrote. “Vaccinating domestic animals, like dogs and cats, not only protects them, but creates a protective barrier between wildlife and people. So if we protect our pets, we protect ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone who has potentially been exposed to a rabid animal — including bites, scratches or contact with saliva — should </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/animal-contact-human-health/rabies-control/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">notify their doctor immediately</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just over five years ago, an email landed in my inbox. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hi Sarah,” it read. “Not sure if you’ve seen the news about us, but I’d like to talk to you about a few freelance assignments I have available for our launch, which is scheduled for later this month. I came across your portfolio and I think you would be a good fit for the stories I have in mind.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little did I know what was coming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That email, sent on July 2, 2018, was from Robert Zullo, the founding editor of The Virginia Mercury and a former reporter at the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The Mercury had </span><a href="https://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/former-times-dispatch-reporters-leading-an-online-news-startup/Content?oid=9765464" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been profiled that June</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Richmond’s long-running alternative paper Style Weekly, which at the time was still covering local news. I didn’t know anything about it besides what I had read in Style, but I liked the little I’d heard. The Mercury would use a nonprofit, online-only model, it planned to focus on state policy and it would take an explanatory tone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of those qualities resonated with me. Because my own background was in local newspapers, I knew that print was declining in the face of an ever more digital public. I was frustrated by the challenges of translating complex policy issues into rigid column inches. And, like so many reporters, I was convinced that there were fascinating, crucial stories out there that would interest readers but weren’t being covered because the companies that owned the papers wouldn’t do the two basic things necessary to cover them: hire more reporters and give them time to report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what the Mercury offered, and five years later, it’s what we still offer. We put reporters on state policy beats to allow them to build their expertise on specific subject areas, and then we give them time to do the stories that matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even today — after one year of freelancing for the Mercury, three years as its energy and environment reporter and one year as its editor-in-chief — I’m amazed at the range of stories the publication has showcased. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Needless to say, we’ve written exhaustively about the General Assembly. January and February are marked by long days and evenings in committee and press rooms, endless cups of coffee from Meriwether’s at the Capitol and that mix of grumpiness, panic and exhilaration that characterizes Virginia’s breakneck sessions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we’ve also written about </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/15/legal-challenge-slows-rural-broadband-plans-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rural broadband gaps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/18/can-patrick-county-save-its-local-hospital/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rural hospitals’ struggle for survival</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about problems with the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/03/every-year-children-are-diverted-away-from-foster-care-and-placed-with-relatives-nobody-knows-what-happens-next/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state’s system of kinship care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/29/virginia-is-spending-millions-to-boost-security-at-state-run-mental-hospitals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">yawning cracks in its behavioral health system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/16/how-redistricting-reform-is-launching-the-virginia-general-assembly-into-a-new-era/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redistricting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/08/va-redistricting-commission-implodes-as-republicans-reject-compromise-and-democrats-walk-out/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redistricting drama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/05/after-buckingham-more-virginia-registrars-find-themselves-on-chopping-block/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">axing of registrars by electoral boards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wrote about the pandemic. A lot. Like, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/category/health/covid-19/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot, a lot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — most of it written while everyone hunkered down at home and communicated via video chat and Slack. We became very familiar with everyone’s work-from-home space, pets and children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of children: The past five years have seen the birth of three Mercury babies, with a fourth on the way this August. It’s been a joy to see our staff’s families grow and, occasionally, show up at the office to remind us all why we do the work we do. </span></p>

(Robert Zullo)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another reminder that the work we are doing matters to Virginians comes from the number of reprints we see of our stories. Because we encourage republication of our articles by other news outlets — find our </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/republishing-guidelines/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republication Guidelines here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — every week we see our reporting picked up by papers and TV stations all over the commonwealth. We see this sharing of high-quality news as a key part of our mission to fill gaps in Virginia’s journalistic landscape. And over the past five years, more and more outlets have turned to our work to supplement their own fine reporting. For us, that’s a win-win situation: Our work gets more readers, their readers get more content, and the newspapers struggling so hard to stay afloat as local watchdogs don’t have to pay a dime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, though, when I reflect on the past five years, I think about the people. Our founding team — Robert Zullo, Ned Oliver, Katie O’Connor and Mechelle Hankerson — have moved on to other exciting roles, as has our former health reporter, Kate Masters, who was chosen by the Virginia Press Association as the state’s Outstanding Young Journalist in 2021. (Ned was VPA’s Outstanding Journalist in 2020.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while all five are deeply missed, we’ve also gotten to welcome other journalists, all of whom have added immense value to our team. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samantha Willis, the former editorial producer for VPM News Focal Point, joined us this January as our deputy and commentary editor, where she’s brought a fresh eye and energy to the task of expanding our commentary section while also providing the extra editorial firepower to help our staff grow. Graham Moomaw, our senior reporter, has been with us since late 2019, covering politics and a host of issues from elections to gambling. Education and transportation reporter Nathaniel Cline and energy and environment reporter Charlie Paullin both joined us in summer 2022 and quickly jumped into their beats. And reporting intern Meghan McIntyre has been learning the ropes of health and investigative coverage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all of our team are news reporters. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samantha works each week with veteran journalists Bob Lewis and Roger Chesley, whose commentaries weigh in on what&#8217;s going on around the state and what it all means, while </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ivy Main and Wyatt Gordon bring their subject-matter expertise to energy, housing and transportation columns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That brings me back to where I started: the Mercury’s goal of hiring new reporters and giving them time to report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we embark on our fifth year, it’s clear that readers are interested in the work we’re doing and that we’re here to stay.

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After an inquiry from the right-wing media outlet Daily Wire this May about two websites listed on a Virginia Department of Health webpage offering resources for LGBTQ youth, internal agency emails indicate Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration took the entire page down, leaving agency employees who oversaw it bewildered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Did someone request this?” asked Emily Yeatts, a supervisor for the Department of Health’s Division of Child and Family Health, in a May 31 email to other staff members. “This request did not come from the program.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At roughly the same time, Vanessa Walker Harris, director of the Office of Family Health Services — the office responsible for managing content on the page — also sent out an email to employees in the division, as well as communications staff and Deputy VDH Commissioner Robert Hicks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m noticing that the referenced webpage is no longer accessible and I’m having a bad case of deja vu,” wrote Walker Harris. “What am I missing? I’m very concerned that staff were directed to remove the webpage without engaging [subject matter experts] in response to a politically motivated inquiry, yet again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Mercury asked VDH on June 5 about the removal of the Resources for LGBTQ Youth page, internal emails obtained under Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act show agency Chief Operating Officer Christopher Lindsay initially drafted a response noting it was “part of an overall project to look at areas of the VDH website that can use redesign.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are using data to look at website traffic and will redesign towards public health initiatives tht are relevant to consumer demand,” Lindsay wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The response was never transmitted to the Mercury. And other emails obtained under FOIA indicate the removal was ordered by the office of Secretary of Health and Human Resources John Littel in response to an inquiry on the morning of May 31 from a Daily Wire reporter named Spencer Lindquist, who subsequently published </span><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/virginia-dept-of-health-promotes-queer-kid-stuff-chat-for-lgbtq-identifying-teens" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on two resources listed on the page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the emails indicate an audit was initiated of the Office of Family Health Services’ webpages, with searches conducted for nine terms related to LGBTQ issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to inquiries about the webpage’s removal and the audit, Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter wrote that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“in Virginia, the governor will always reaffirm a parent’s role in their child’s life. Children belong to their parents, not the state.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The webpage in question outsourced conversations where adults directly speak with children about sex to a third party,” Porter said. “The governor supports providing resources that are age appropriate however the government should not facilitate anonymous conversations between adults and children without a parent’s approval. Sexualizing children against a parent’s wishes doesn’t belong on a taxpayer supported website.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screenshots of the LGBTQ Resources for Youth webpage found through the Wayback Machine show the page included links to two national websites known as Q Chat Space and Queer Kid Stuff, as well as Virginia Pride, state LGBTQ organizations the TREVOR Project and the Virginia Antiviolence Project, which operate help lines and run suicide prevention programs, and medical and counseling services for LGBTQ and transgender youth in the Richmond area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindquist was particularly interested in the Q Chat Space and Queer Kid Stuff sites. At 9:12 that morning, he sent agency communications staff a series of inquiries about the two links. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How are resources selected by the Virginia Department of Health?” Lindquist wrote. “Queer Kid Stuff has previously promoted child transgenderism. Does the Virginia Department of Health take a stance on the medical transitioning of minors? Is the Virginia Department of Health aware that the QChat Space, which is marketed to those as young as 13 who identify as LGBT, has a special quick escape feature that allows users to swiftly exit the site?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindquist gave the agency two hours to reply. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.qchatspace.org/Learn-More" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Q Chat Space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which offers “live, chat-based discussion groups for LGBTQ+ and questioning teens ages 13 to 19 … facilitated by experienced staff and volunteers from youth programs at LGBTQ+ centers across the United States,” was developed by three groups: CenterLink, which provides support to community LGBTQ centers; PFLAG, the nation’s largest and oldest organization for LGBTQ people; and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.queerkidstuff.com/aboutus" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Queer Kid Stuff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> describes itself as “an edutainment company on a mission to spread queer joy to LGBTQ+ kids, parents, caregivers, educators, their loved ones, and allies.” Among its “core values” the group lists “centering queer identity, experience, and history … with particular emphasis on unearthing historic erasure,” “working to actively destigmatize queer topics in early childhood spaces,” promoting joy and community, “liberating all children from white supremacist systems that do not prioritize the needs of our youngest and most vulnerable,” and “actively pushing against business models that prioritize capital over humanity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to an internal email by Lindsay, both Q Chat Space and Queer Kid Stuff were added to the agency webpage in October 2019. Over the past 12 months, Lindsay noted 189 visitors to the page had clicked through to Q Chat Space, while Queer Kid Stuff had been accessed 154 times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, Lindsay said the LGBTQ Resources for Youth page had been visited over 2,500 times in the past year. In almost 2,100 of those visits, people who accessed the site immediately left it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Lindquist’s inquiry on the morning of May 31, Yeatts and Rachel Brown, VDH’s adolescent health coordinator, drafted a response to his questions, which they sent onto communications staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of VDH&#8217;s goals is to be a trusted source of public health information for all Virginians. All Virginians includes people of all ages, races, ethnicities, gender identities, sexual orientations, and ability statuses,” the draft statement read. “VDH does not have a ‘stance’ on medical transition; as a state agency, VDH provides information, and the administration takes a position on issues.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“VDH&#8217;s webpage includes information for all people, including transgender youth, and strives to include information consistent with best public health practices,” it continued. “QChat Space is not managed by VDH, but we can share that ‘quick escape’ features are typical for a variety of websites, particularly websites that could put a person at risk for violence from others. Intimate partner violence/sexual violence/domestic violence webpages often have this feature. LGBT people are at increased risk for violence.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement was never used. Instead, VDH Director of Communications Maria Reppas told staff she was “working with leadership on this one” and “given the timeline the reporter gave, we will be unable to meet it.” Lindquist’s story ultimately noted the agency had not responded to a request for comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometime that afternoon, the LGBTQ Resources for Youth page was removed, prompting the flurry of inquiries from staffers including Walker Harris and Yeatts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At nearly 5 p.m., Walker Harris emailed several agency employees to say she had “received an update that HHR directed removal of the webpage.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m hopeful that we&#8217;ll get additional guidance about allowable resources and be able to post some, if not all of the provider and state resources back to the webpage,” she continued, before referencing an “audit” of OFHS webpages for the words “LGBTQIA,” “queer,” “transgender,” “lesbian,” “gay,” “bisexual,” “questioning” and “non binary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another email, Walker Harris said she had expressed frustration to VDH’s recently appointed new commissioner, Dr. Karen Shelton, about the removal of the webpage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shelton “apologized for how it was handled; she received a directive from HHR to pull the webpage down and there wasn’t much time to communicate about it,” Walker Harris wrote. “She was receptive to my feedback and I asked if we could receive an update on allowable resources from the page to repost since the resources targeting queer adolescents were just a portion of the site. So more to come on that.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of July 6, the webpage had not been restored. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I also shared that this isn’t our first experience with webpages, links, etc disappearing,” Walker Harris continued in an apparent reference to the removal of several VDH webpages on sexual health resources for adolescents and an online presentation identifying one of VDH’s priorities as exploring and eliminating “drivers of structural and institutional racism.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those pages were removed under prior Commissioner Dr. Colin Greene, who came under fire following </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/15/racial-disparities-health-care-youngkin/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about his skepticism of established scientific research linking racism with sharp disparities in maternal mortality. Senate Democrats later <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/07/senate-democrats-boot-youngkin-health-commissioner-two-other-appointees/" target="_blank">blocked Greene’s appointment over the controversy</a>. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Under the Fourth Amendment, probable cause of contraband is the standard to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">obtain </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a warrant, not the standard to search a person without one,” wrote Judge Lisa M. Lorish in </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/0744224.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she continued, “The number of exceptions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement make this an exceedingly difficult analysis, and we sympathize with the trial judge here.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The July 5 ruling reverses a Culpeper County Circuit Court decision that the drugs found in the search could be included in the trial of Renee Parady, one of three people stopped by Culpeper Sheriff’s Deputy Dustin Tharp in the early hours of Jan. 28, 2021. Parady had asked the court to block the use of the drugs as evidence on the grounds that they had been obtained through an unconstitutional warrantless search.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parady ultimately pleaded guilty to felony possession of a controlled substance but reserved the right to appeal the court’s denial of her request to suppress the drugs as evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia argued in support of including the drugs as evidence, saying Tharp had probable cause to believe Parady was concealing narcotics, the search was done as part of an arrest and the search was justified by “exigent circumstances” — in this case, the fear that Parady would destroy the drugs if Tharp had to wait to get the warrant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Culpeper Circuit Court previously rejected the third argument, finding that because Parady was placed in the back of a police vehicle and three officers were at the scene, Tharp could have gotten a search warrant without risking the destruction of the drugs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Court of Appeals on Wednesday rejected the other two arguments. Tharp had not actually arrested Parady the night of the search, the judges noted, and she would not be arrested until nearly two months later. The court concluded her search could not be justified on that basis, quoting the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Robinson that “it is the fact of the lawful arrest which establishes the authority to search.” (While Virginia argued the officer had not arrested Parady at the scene because she said she had tested positive for COVID-19, the court of appeals pointed out Tharp arrested the driver on a separate charge, even though he said he had been quarantining in a house of sick people, including Parady.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the court ruled that the officer having probable cause to arrest Parady was not sufficient grounds to search her without a warrant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that a warrantless search fits under an exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment,” the court wrote. “While the exceptions are many, mere probable cause is not one of them.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case will now return to Culpeper Circuit Court.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Asian longhorned ticks continue to spread throughout Virginia and the United States, scientists are racing to understand how the species is expanding so fast and how they can keep a virulent parasite carried by the ticks from infecting herds of cattle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a geographic niche for these ticks, and we are reaping that,” said Dr. Kevin Lahmers, associate lab director of Virginia Tech’s Animal Laboratory Services and a professor with the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine. But, he added, “We still have a lot to learn.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asian longhorned ticks have likely been in the U.S. since 2010, but </span><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/9/19-0088_article" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven cattle deaths in Virginia’s Albemarle County in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found the species was carrying a new threat to livestock: a virulent form of the Theileria orientalis parasite, which can cause a disease known as theileriosis characterized by anemia, fever, jaundice, respiratory problems and weakness in cattle. In some cases, cows become so depleted that they spontaneously abort fetuses; in other cases, cattle die. Research has estimated this particular form of Theileria, known as the Ikeda genotype, causes mortality rates between 1% and 5%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, variation is wide, said Lahmers. “There are herds that have zero percent mortality. And we have some that have had 25%.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, when the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) began testing cattle at sales barns and livestock auctions for Theileria, Lahmers said about 1% to 2% of cows turned up positive. That percentage has grown dramatically: While he has not yet finalized his data for publication, Lahmers said he’s seen a “10- to 20-fold increase” in positive cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither he nor VDACS have firm estimates of cattle deaths linked to theileriosis, but Lahmers said that “if we count cattle deaths and abortions, we’re probably in the thousands.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It spread easily,” he said. “It doesn’t cause death in the majority — similar to COVID, it’s only a problem for a few, but the way the cattle industry works, there isn’t that much margin for profit. So if you lose 5% of your herd or 5% abort … that’s enough to take you from marginally profitable to significant financial losses.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Asian longhorned ticks are also showing up in more Virginia counties. In 2019, they had been detected in 24 counties, largely following the spine of Interstate 81 and then stretching west into the coalfields region. By this June, the number of counties had jumped to 38.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems to be the higher elevations along the I-81 corridor,” said Lahmers. “All of those counties are positive or are going to be positive soon.” </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia isn’t the only state grappling with the ticks. Between 2019 and April 2023, the number of states that had detected the species rose from 11 to 19, with the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/longhorned-tick/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identifying it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia, as well as Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not sure that the expansion in Virginia is any faster than anywhere else,” said Lahmers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists aren’t sure yet how the tick is managing to spread as quickly as it is, but they have identified several possible factors. One is the species’ willingness to feed on an array of animals, including migratory birds, which means they have less trouble finding sustenance to survive and reproduce. Another is the tick’s asexual method of reproduction, which allows it to reproduce without relying on a mate.</span></p>

        </a>
        
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever the cause, an increasing number of Asian longhorned ticks appear to be moving into Virginia’s cattle regions, and theileriosis is a growing concern. The disease has no approved treatment in the U.S., so agricultural officials are focusing on controlling tick populations. They are urging farmers to regularly inspect their herds or any new animals being added, keep cattle out of wooded areas, mow pastures, use ear tags treated with pesticides and submit tick samples to local Virginia Cooperative Extension agents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As there is no cure, treatment should focus on supportive measures including stress reduction, nutritional supplementation and above all, prevention in the form of tick control,” said Dr. Charles Broaddus, Virginia’s state veterinarian, in a VDACS release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Lahmers warned, just because a cow tests positive for theileriosis doesn’t mean that any subsequent illness it might suffer is due to theileriosis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the spread and the concerns, Lahmers said there’s no need to panic. Most cattle survive theileriosis, and researchers are actively working to better understand the disease and its connections to the Asian longhorned tick through cooperative agreements between the state and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service and Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, he said, “it was a Virginia problem.” But “with time, we have found out it wasn’t just a Virginia problem and it has continued to spread.” </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin Thursday praised the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision striking down affirmative action at higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, after the Supreme Court’s ruling, we are closer than ever before to ensuring that an individual’s future opportunities are unlocked based on the trajectory of their potential, their aspirations and the quality of their capabilities as opposed to simply on their race,” Youngkin said on Twitter shortly after the country’s highest court struck down race-conscious admissions in a case involving Harvard University and the University of North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who in 2021 became the first Black woman to hold statewide office in Virginia, also applauded the outcome, saying it will “ensure college admissions are based on a student&#8217;s merits, not the color of their skin.” Earle-Sears noted she had joined a legal brief supporting the plaintiffs who challenged affirmative action policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, who did not comment on the ruling, also signed onto </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-1199/222849/20220509155246082_OkSFA%20Merits%20Amicus%20MAIN%20May%209%202022%20E%20File.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a brief supporting the plaintiffs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats had sharply different reactions to the </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6-3 decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling that consideration of race violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, said the decision “undermines an important effort to address racial inequality caused by our nation’s history with racism,” adding, “The impact of 246 years of slavery and 100 years of Jim Crow on our communities and institutions did not go away with a magic wand.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who began his career as a lawyer fighting housing discrimination in Richmond, said the “strength of Virginia’s—and America’s—higher education system lies in its diversity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today’s sad ruling means we have even more work to do to address our nation’s ugly history of racism and root out the system inequities that unfairly burden diverse communities, like Black and Latino Americans,” Kaine said. “Not only are those system inequities plain wrong; they hurt all of us and hold our economy back.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the court ruled</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The majority opinion penned by Chief Justice John Roberts found Harvard and UNC “fail to operate their race-based admissions programs in a manner that is ‘sufficiently measurable to permit judicial [review],’” haven’t sufficiently proved a connection between those programs and goals like increasing diversity and training future leaders and haven’t identified an endpoint by which the programs would no longer be considered necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the court ruled that the universities’ programs “fail to comply with Equal Protection Clause’s twin commands that race may never be used as a ‘negative’ and that it may not operate as a stereotype,” pointing to a lower court finding that Harvard’s process resulted in fewer admissions of Asian American students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “assertion that race is never a negative factor in their admissions programs cannot withstand scrutiny,” the majority wrote. “College admissions are zero-sum, and a benefit provided to some applicants but not to others necessarily advantages the former at the expense of the latter.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that the ruling will result in “further entrenching racial inequality in education” and will end progress toward more inclusive schools begun in Brown v. Board of Education. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For 45 years, the Court extended Brown’s transformative legacy to the context of higher education, allowing colleges and universities to consider race in a limited way and for the limited purpose of promoting the important benefits of racial diversity,” she wrote. “This limited use of race has helped equalize educational opportunities for all students of every race and background and has improved racial diversity on college campuses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday’s ruling, she concluded, “cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Impact on Virginia schools</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia universities reacted cautiously Thursday to the ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin Jay, a spokesperson for William &amp; Mary, said “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the university will take time thoughtfully to review (the ruling) and understand if there are implications to William &amp; Mary’s comprehensive review process for admissions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university reported that 32% of its students “identify as people of color” and </span><a href="https://www.wm.edu/offices/compliance/discrimination_overview/affirmative_action/index.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on its website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has said it is “committed to affirmative action, equal opportunity/equity, and diversity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Virginia Commonwealth University President Michael Rao said the school “has been preparing for some time by evaluating admissions procedures and considering the impact of this ruling.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he acknowledged that “we won’t know all of those answers right away,” he said that “many of VCU’s admissions procedures are unlikely to be affected.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rao noted that a third of VCU’s incoming freshman class are first-generation students, while a third of undergraduate students are eligible for Pell grants.</span></p>
<p>George Mason University said flatly the decision will have no impact on the school, because it doesn&#8217;t consider race in its admissions process and admits more than 90% of undergraduate applicants. In August, GMU said, the school will &#8220;once again welcome the largest and most diverse student body in the history of the Commonwealth of Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This diversity of origin, identity, circumstance, and thought is what drives our quality and defines our character,&#8221; <a href="https://www.gmu.edu/news/2023-06/george-mason-university-statement-supreme-court-rulings-regarding-college-admissions" target="_blank">GMU said</a>. &#8220;When walking across one of our campuses, the rich diversity everyone sees is not artificially curated by an admissions process primarily defined by keeping students out.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Tech said its administration is reviewing the ruling but will continue to live up to its motto “Ut Prosim (That I May Serve)” and its goal of providing a “practical education to all members of the commonwealth, nation, and beyond.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To accomplish this mission, we will continue to work hard to expand access to underserved and underrepresented populations,” Virginia Tech said in a statement from its communications office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Eric Claville, a political and legal analyst and professor of politics and law at Norfolk State University, characterized the Supreme Court&#8217;s Thursday ruling as both expected and regressive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Higher education leaders have known for a long time that this challenge [to affirmative action] would come,” he said. “We need these policies to advance diversity and equity on campuses, and the law is the incentive to make and enforce those changes. Without that, we will not have the same protections for promoting diverse, inclusive, equitable student bodies in Virginia and elsewhere.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claville said the high court&#8217;s decision “will have far-reaching implications beyond limiting race-based admissions in colleges.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that here in Virginia, we will see ripple effects – perhaps in the way we hire for jobs, in the ways we support our communities, in the work across many sectors – that could basically roll back advancement opportunities for non-white people,&#8221; he said.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s budget negotiators don’t agree on whether they did or didn’t agree to a preliminary deal months ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Appropriations Chairman Barry Knight, R-Virginia Beach, and Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, emerged this week from their budget talks — which the General Assembly conducts mostly in private until a deal is reached — with two starkly different accounts of how negotiations progressed this year before falling apart on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knight has sketched out the details of a proposed compromise that makes several concessions to Democrats, such as dropping Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s plan to lower the corporate tax rate and adjusting the state’s income tax brackets, which haven’t changed since 1990, in a way that benefits lower-income filers instead of the highest earners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Knight’s telling, Senate negotiators had already agreed to those terms but wanted to delay moving forward on the deal until after last week’s primaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They said they were fine with it,” Knight said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When meetings in Richmond restarted this week, Knight said, Barker — who lost his primary last Tuesday — insisted there was no deal and would not let Knight explain his proposal to other senators working on the budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate negotiators in turn have said there was never a firm deal struck in February, and it’s Knight and the House that tanked an evolving deal by insisting any agreement had to involve longer-term tax cuts rather than accepting an offer of nearly $900 million in one-time rebates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were in the middle of negotiations and they actually walked away from the table,” said Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, characterized the breakdown in talks as stemming from “a basic disagreement about a conversation that occurred between the chairs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Barry Knight has one version of what happened in that conversation. George Barker has another,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because Virginia operates on a two-year budget cycle, the state can continue operating past the June 30 end of the current fiscal year without disruption. But the lack of the new budget bill has caused uncertainty for other public bodies that make decisions based on how much money they can expect from the state. The extended budgetary limbo also means roughly $3.6 billion in surplus funds still cannot be allocated to bipartisan priorities like teacher pay raises and more funding for the struggling mental health system.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;As Virginia budget negotiations drag on, here&#8217;s what hangs in the balance&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/30/as-virginia-budget-negotiations-drag-on-heres-what-hangs-in-the-balance/embed/#?secret=AlkSMJoaVV#?secret=toclk9N9HS" data-secret="toclk9N9HS" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax policy has been the main area of friction between Democrats and Republicans. The Democratic-controlled Senate has balked at many of Youngkin’s proposed tax cuts, characterizing them as overly generous to the wealthy and corporations and potentially hazardous to the state’s long-term fiscal health. Republicans have argued state revenues are strong enough the government can afford to give all taxpayers a break while spending significantly more in key areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impasse is a long-running one, but it broke into the public this week in dramatic fashion when Knight announced Democrats had “decided to abandon” a deal he said the parties had reached in February but put off announcing due to a stiff primary challenge Barker was facing. On Tuesday, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/06/27/youngkin-budget-tax-cuts/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Youngkin said he believed the stalemate was “a massive failing from the leadership in the Democrat party in the Senate.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans say uncertainty over who’s in charge of the Senate Democratic Caucus has contributed to the budget confusion, with both Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax and Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax, who co-chairs the chamber’s budget committee, heading into retirement. Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, just campaigned heavily on the idea that she’s next in line to run the budget committee, and the odds moved in her favor last week when she won her primary and Barker lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knight said he feels more progress could be made if other Senate Democrats could be involved, since Barker is now a “lame duck.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only thing that&#8217;s changed is Janet was not there Monday because she&#8217;s in Japan on a trip she&#8217;s had planned for a year,” Knight said. “And George lost his election.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knight suggested Howell could verify there was an initial agreement. In remarks </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/06/27/youngkin-budget-tax-cuts/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=wp_local" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported by the Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Barker indicated Howell was “a little more open” to the GOP’s offer than he was. Howell’s office did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unclear how many other Democrats are fully in the loop on what Knight was offering. Deeds said other Senate negotiators didn’t see the tax bracket proposal until Tuesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Barry Knight says he told George and Janet about it in February, but it was not communicated to us,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Barker said the Senate conferees are “operating as a team” just like their House counterparts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessarily appropriate to have him come in and try to say things that are not necessarily completely true,” Barker said in response to Knight’s attempt to present his plan to more senators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said the caucus as a whole has not been briefed on any proposed deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think tax cuts would be a hard sell to my caucus,” Surovell said. “It sounds like George has made that clear in multiple rounds. But the Republicans have continued to cater to the governor&#8217;s demand for tax cuts.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A closed-door process</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The varied accounts highlight the opaqueness of Virginia’s budget process, much of which is conducted behind closed doors by an inner circle of negotiators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They don’t brief members outside of the Appropriations Committee about this at all,” said Del. Danica Roem, D-Manassas. “We find out about stuff like this through news reports.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many lawmakers in Richmond say the complexity of budget negotiations and the requirement that the state balance its books make it necessary for smaller groups of legislators to hammer out the final details of an agreement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s logically infeasible to imagine all 140 members casting line item votes on every budget item,” said Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville, who recently lost a tight primary against Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, one of the Senate’s budget conferees. “At some point you do need a set of people to sit down and close the gap between the House and the Senate versions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s system — which Roem says was “originally designed to be done in a smoke-filled back room” — those negotiations unfold almost entirely in private. Once the chambers choose the conferees who will participate in talks, no formal public meetings are typically held until the chief negotiators announce a deal and the House and Senate vote on the completed version. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That can lead to conflicts like the one that has emerged in Richmond this week, where there’s little ability to verify what was agreed to and when. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The House proposal</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three major components of the roughly $900 million tax relief plan sketched out by Knight are another increase to the state’s standard deduction for income taxes, tax rebate checks of $100 for single filers and $200 for joint filers and changes to the state’s income tax brackets that closely mirror a recommendation from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had proposed dropping the state’s top tax bracket, which kicks in at $17,000 of taxable income, from 5.75% to 5%. Knight’s proposal wouldn’t lower the top rate but instead adjusts all the brackets to have the top rate apply to income over $30,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed bracket structure aligns with a JLARC recommendation to tweak the brackets to account for inflation since 1990. Leaving the brackets the same creates so-called “bracket creep,” where the tax burden for low- and middle-income filers grows faster than their income because more of the money they make is taxed at the highest rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knight said the numbers crunched on his plan show it “helps lower-income people a whole lot better than what we have today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was a recommendation of JLARC to do that,” Knight said. Documents outlining the proposal suggest the bracket changes were seen as a way to make the tax code “more progressive” without raising taxes on the rich.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By fiscal year 2025, the bracket adjustments would make up $655 million of the roughly $911 million impact on the budget. The standard deduction increase would cost $200 million, with smaller tax breaks for military retirement pay and business interest making up the rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knight said he’s ready to meet with any other Senate Democratic leaders to discuss the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I want a budget deal,” he said. “I am operating with them in good faith.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the Senate wants</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate negotiators have instead pushed for one-time tax relief, largely in the form of rebates, while rejecting structural tax cuts that many say could imperil Virginia’s financial stability as federal COVID-era funds are spent down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re fortunate that we do have additional revenue,” said Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta. “But the thing that I’ll continue to cite is you have to look at where that came from.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Senate negotiators say they are prioritizing one-time investments in services like education and behavioral health, pointing to shortfalls like the </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/facing-25-billion-price-tag-bid-to-help-virginia-cities-and-counties-build-schools-dies/article_0600cda0-aefc-11ed-80d3-ff1b3739042a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated $25 billion needed to modernize and construct school buildings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around Virginia and the state’s troubled mental health system, which in 2021 was forced to temporarily close admissions at five facilities. Youngkin has made the overhaul of that system a signature priority, rolling out an ambitious $230 million “Right Help, Right Now” proposal this December that has garnered bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reality from my perspective is we have starved some of our services for far too long,” said Deeds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barker’s counter-proposal was a bigger round of one-time tax rebates without structural tax cuts. Senate negotiators said they put forward two proposals this week: an initial $670 million tax relief plan that was rejected, followed by an $890 million plan that would have included a $200 rebate payment for single filers and $400 for couples as well as other tax changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It gets money in the hands of the people of Virginia at a time where we have the resources to be able to do it,” Barker said, without “locking” the state into structural cuts that could cause budgetary damage if a recession occurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal to alter the tax brackets has sparked tentative interest. Deeds said it “probably makes sense, but I think in order to make sure it’s revenue-neutral, you have to add another bracket at the top.” Hanger said while he’s in favor of changing the brackets, the policy needs to be evaluated more broadly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re going to have a progressive tax code structure, the people who can afford it need to pay more than those who can&#8217;t afford it,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Hanger and Deeds emphasized the need to resume talks, although Deeds said the situation was not unprecedented, pointing to a 2001 standoff between then-Gov. Jim Gilmore and the Senate that ultimately kept the General Assembly from amending its biennial budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s totally unacceptable to not produce a budget,” said Hanger. “That is totally inadequate to the needs of the commonwealth.” </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has netted over $1.48 billion in federal funds to expand its broadband network following a state push to update the government’s map of where in Virginia the service is available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment “brings us a giant step closer to achieving our goal of universal broadband coverage in Virginia,” said U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, in a release. “We all know that access to fast, reliable, and affordable internet is crucial to ensuring our rural communities grow and thrive.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia received the </span><a href="https://internetforall.gov/news-media/biden-harris-administration-announces-state-allocations-4245-billion-high-speed-internet" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sixth-largest award of the $42.5 billion being distributed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the federal Broadband, Equity, Accessibility and Deployment, or BEAD, grant program. The largest went to Texas, at $3.31 billion, followed by California, at $1.86 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southern neighbor North Carolina squeaked in just above the commonwealth, at $1.53 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the money will be overseen by the </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/vati" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Telecommunication Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the Department of Housing and Community Development. Grants will be targeted toward unserved locations — areas with internet speeds lower than 25 megabits per second for downloads and 3 megabits per second for uploads — and underserved locations — areas with speeds below 100 megabits per second downloads and 20 megabits per second uploads. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government’s calculations of how much each state would get through the BEAD program relied heavily on the National Broadband Map maintained by the Federal Communications Commission, which charts access to the increasingly critical service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the FCC released a new version of the map that tracked broadband availability by </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/11/the-feds-have-mapped-broadband-availability-are-they-right-about-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">address rather than by census block</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an approach that many researchers had previously criticized as overstating coverage. Virginia had already taken steps in this direction, revamping its state maps in 2021 to show the percentage of residents in each census block with internet access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the federal government for the first time solicited Americans’ feedback on the accuracy of its map through an online website. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner credited that public input Monday as a factor in Virginia securing what he described as a “whopping” award. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This funding is in no small part thanks to the Virginians that took time out of their day to report their connectivity status,” he wrote. “Because of these efforts, we were able to accurately report our coverage and access every cent to which Virginia was entitled.”</span></p>

(CNU)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kids are not all right, and they aren’t afraid to tell you that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On college campuses in Virginia and nationwide, students are increasingly reporting struggles with mental health. </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2019/03/mental-health-adults" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032722002774" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has shown rising cases of anxiety, depression and other forms of psychological distress among students aged 18 to 25 — trends that predate but were exacerbated by the isolation and disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The complexity of the mental health challenges that students are facing and when they come for the first time in the clinic are growing,” said Kevin Hughes, vice president of student affairs and dean of students at Christopher Newport University in Newport News. “It’s not just the volume, but it’s how complex the issue is that they’re dealing with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another thing the kids aren’t afraid to do? Ask for help. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of us have it together by the time we’re 25,” said Courtney Hairston, a counselor-in-residence at Christopher Newport’s Office of Counseling Services. But today, she said, “the stigma, I think, is gone.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This generation is like, ‘Hey, we need help. Help us,’” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to a decade ago, the number of students seeking mental health services on college campuses has skyrocketed. An </span><a href="https://ccmh.psu.edu/assets/docs/2022%20Annual%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Penn State University’s Center for Collegiate Mental Health found that during the 2021-22 school year, almost 191,000 students at roughly 180 higher education institutions in the U.S. sought mental health treatment at campus counseling centers. In 2011-12, by comparison, that figure was just over 97,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same trend can be seen on Virginia campuses, say numerous people working in education and health in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Radford University, roughly 45 minutes southwest of Roanoke, </span><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/education/radford-university-enrollment-decline-bret-danilowicz/article_3d425c96-ccd1-11ed-8647-9b16caa7145d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enrollment is dropping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But despite that, “we’re seeing an uptick in the percentage of students we’re seeing in the counseling center,” said Brian Lusk, the school’s director of student counseling services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The younger generation of students are coming in more in tune with their mental health needs and more willing to seek out treatment,” said Lusk. And while he said it’s encouraging to see students being proactive about their needs, “it really puts a strain on our counseling centers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of our counseling centers are staffed reasonably well, but they’re not staffed well enough to handle the kind of need we’re seeing now,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Virginia is trying to harness campuses’ soaring demand for mental health services to meet another goal: get more young professionals in the pipeline to provide them. In 2022, lawmakers added $1 million to the state’s two-year budget for a pilot program that would pay salaries and benefits for counseling and social work graduates pursuing state licensure to work at campus student health and counseling centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A May 30 </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2023/RD244/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV), as well as interviews with participating universities and other people involved in the effort, indicate that nearly a year after the General Assembly signed off on the initiative, it’s showing promising results. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Participating institutions are already seeing tangible impacts,” SCHEV wrote in the May report. Among the takeaways: Five residents employed through the program have provided over 740 hours of direct clinical services to 220 students on Virginia campuses while racking up over 1,000 hours of supervised practice needed for their licensure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Adding this professional colleague has bolstered morale and bandwidth and prevented burnout and turnover of clinicians,” wrote one supervisor in anonymous comments on the pilot included in the report. “In sum, this hire has stabilized the counseling center and our services to the university.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Christopher Newport, “they have hit the ground running,” said Bill Ritchey, executive director of counseling and health services. “My most pressing question is: How do we keep it going?” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Rising demand, looming provider shortages</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among nearly all age groups, there&#8217;s a rising demand for mental health services nationwide. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, policy discussions have mainly centered on the state’s troubled </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/14/youngkin-proposes-230-million-behavioral-health-overhaul/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">behavioral health system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the network of community services boards and state-run facilities that provide treatment to people who are in crisis or experiencing the most severe mental health challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while the overburdened public system deserves attention, said Deborah Oswalt, executive director of the Virginia Health Care Foundation (VHCF), the majority of Virginians who seek mental health treatment are in search of more “basic” services. Those include treatment for conditions such as depression, anxiety and panic disorder, as well as help dealing with difficult circumstances like a death or traumas linked to situations like abuse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s really not been much of a state focus on that end of the continuum,” said Oswalt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as demand has risen, the number of professionals available to meet that demand has fallen in Virginia, with data showing it could shrink ever further as a wave of behavioral health providers prepare to retire. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The need and demand for behavioral health services far exceeds the available capacity to meet them,” found a </span><a href="https://www.vhcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BH-Assessment-Final-1.11.2022.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 report from the Virginia Health Care Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “[Behavioral health] professionals throughout the Commonwealth are overwhelmed and Virginians are waiting months for help.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VHCF’s data paint a stark portrait. Of Virginia’s 133 localities, the organization found, 93 are considered by federal standards to have a shortage of mental health professionals. At the time the report was issued, two localities — Craig County near the West Virginia border and Surry County just west of Newport News — had no licensed behavioral health professionals of any kind. Forty-eight localities had one or fewer full-time clinical psychologists, while 11 had one or fewer full-time social workers and 16 had one or fewer licensed professional counselors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workforce was also nearing what the VHCF called a “provider cliff”: Among psychiatrists, 61% of providers were aged 55 and older, as were 36% of licensed clinical psychologists, 37% of licensed clinical social workers and 32% of licensed professional counselors. Furthermore, the majority of providers were white, </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/2020-united-states-population-more-racially-ethnically-diverse-than-2010.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even as Virginia becomes more diverse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As more people get comfortable with seeking out mental health treatment there’s not going to be enough providers,” said Lusk. “In reality, pretty much all of us could use someone to talk to at some point in our lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Life is full of challenges,” he continued. “And trying to suck it up and rub some dirt on it or whatever you want to say, those southern sayings, and push through it, it doesn’t work well for everyone.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A long road to licensure</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the aging workforce, getting new professionals into the field has been difficult because of the steep requirements many graduates face to achieve licensure in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The largest sectors of Virginia’s behavioral health professions are clinical social workers and professional counselors, who in 2021 made up almost three-quarters of the workforce, according to VHCF data. While roughly 4,000 of the 12,000 current professionals in those fields are nearing retirement age, colleges and universities in the commonwealth are only producing approximately 400 graduates per year — not enough to offset the exits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More crucially, those graduates still lack licensure. While both professional counseling and clinical social work require graduate-level degrees, licensure requires graduates to undergo thousands of hours of clinical and supervised practice. Professional counselors must undergo 3,400 hours of clinical work experience, of which 2,000 must be direct client contact and 200 must be supervised. For clinical social workers, the requirement is 3,000 hours of experience, including 1,380 clinical hours and 100 supervised hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s one of the big hurdles a lot of [licensed professional counselors] have,” said Ritchey. “I think there’s a lot of people who want to be in higher education who are LPCs that the doors need to be opened to.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supervised hours are particularly tricky for graduates, as most are forced to pay experienced practitioners an average rate of $100 per hour for the supervision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s a lot of money,” said Lusk. “If someone’s charging you $100, $150 an hour, that adds up fast.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hairston, the counselor-in-residence at Christopher Newport, said supervision posed a barrier for many of her fellow students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have some private practice members who are willing to work with you, some who are not,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s steep licensure requirements, in the absence of other mechanisms to offset the burdens, may also be weeding out candidates with graduate degrees in their field but without the resources to navigate a prolonged and expensive process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Given the low salaries available to these pre-licensees ($42,000 &#8211; $47,000/year) and the high student debt load they carry, many cannot run the financial gauntlet of paying for the required supervision hours,” the VHCF report found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has “some of the strictest and highest standards to get licensure,” said Lusk. “We have to be gatekeepers of our profession, right? But sometimes we have such high standards in Virginia, it really puts a barrier up.” </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">&#8216;Exactly what we&#8217;ve been trying to do for such a long time&#8217;</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, Virginia has become increasingly interested in putting state support toward licensure of counseling and clinical social work graduates. VHCF’s </span><a href="https://www.vhcf.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Potential-Boost-Participant-Summary-2.10.23.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boost 200 program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which aims to speed up the licensure of 200 behavioral health professionals by paying for their required supervision hours, has received funding from the General Assembly and Virginia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in 2022, conversations between the foundation and SCHEV led to a new idea: Why not marry the need for licensure with growing college campus needs for mental health services? </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_33177" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Getty_student_college-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-33177" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Getty_student_college-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Getty_student_college-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Getty_student_college-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Getty_student_college-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Getty_student_college-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Getty_student_college-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Getty_student_college-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (Getty Images / ferrantraite)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Obviously the pandemic really brought to light a lot of issues related to student mental health,” said Emily Salmon, a senior associate with the state council. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colleges and universities were immediately enthusiastic. With the General Assembly allocating $500,000 in each of the fiscal years 2023 and 2024 to the pilot, the schools scrambled to apply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is literally something I’ve been looking for for honestly almost my whole career,” said Ritchey. “This is exactly what we’ve been trying to do for such a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 10 colleges and universities that applied for funding, six were chosen. Their awards ranged from $66,810 for Longwood to $100,000 for Christopher Newport, which chose to cover resident benefits with university funds in order to add two graduates to its counseling center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The interest and submission of proposals exceeded the amount of funding that was available,” said Salmon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Oswalt, the rush of interest from schools made it clear the pilot was filling an urgent need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This isn’t a problem that somebody made up or something,” she said. “Universities can be pretty slow sometimes in the way they do things, but I think it’s telling that a good chunk of grantees really made an effort to advertise and get someone on board quickly so they could get the whole thing started.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five months in, Lusk at Radford and Ritchey and Hughes, the dean of students, at Christopher Newport said the benefits of the initiative were already clear — not just among the residents offering care, but among the students receiving it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a real critical juncture in life,” said Ritchey. “It’s the first time in life when a person is out of the parents’ home but they’re not set so much that they have the encumbrances that a lot of us adults have, so it’s a real prime time for some heavy lifting in terms of self-exploration and personal development.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My hope is that we lose the word ‘pilot,’ and then it just becomes a program,” said Hughes.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embezzlement occurred at seven stores operated by the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority over the last year, according to ABC officials, after employees exploited a vulnerability in the cash register system that was flagged by an internal audit report in September 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The liquor authority’s leadership insists that audit report went undetected by senior officials for six months and was only rediscovered in February of this year, a claim ABC Board Chairman Tim Hugo recently said he found “perplexing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s got people interested — how this thing has been floating around for six months from September to February and nobody knew,” Hugo, a former Republican delegate appointed to the ABC role by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, said at a board meeting last week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Questions about that timeline have taken on added significance due to four high-ranking ABC officials who worked in retail and logistics recently being placed on administrative leave, a move that has sparked concern among some in the agency that those employees are potentially being scapegoated for cash register vulnerabilities known to at least some ABC officials in audit and law enforcement roles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hugo seemed to draw a connection between the disciplinary actions and the internal thefts in the board’s public meeting before he and others in the room agreed further discussion of personnel matters should only occur in a closed session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the process point of view, everybody should be treated the same,” Hugo said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC spokesperson Pat Kane said the authority “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">does not comment on personnel matters in order to protect the individuals involved.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> report, which was produced by ABC’s internal audit division and dated Sept. 13, 2022, the authority became aware of the vulnerability in the system after employees at one of its liquor stores in Roanoke figured out how to steal thousands of dollars from its cash registers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC denied the Mercury access to the report, citing exemptions in the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. However, sources at ABC who spoke with the Mercury on the condition of anonymity out of concern about retaliation shared the report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report details a scheme by three employees at Store 289 to exploit the “suspend” and “item void” commands in ABC’s point-of-sale system to pocket more than $8,000 from the cash register without the losses being detected in daily store reports. Investigators said they were able to document the fraudulent activity beginning in February 2022, although they suspected it could have begun “as early as September of 2021.” The embezzlement was only detected, the report notes, when the store manager “had a ‘feeling’ about one of the 3 participants and began to investigate.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was no internal control in place that facilitated the discovery,” the audit report notes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 11, 2022, a regional manager contacted ABC’s enforcement division and other authority officials about the thefts. Kane said “his report described how the vulnerability was exploited and provided evidence of the activity.” An enforcement agent then began investigating the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 5, ABC enforcement contacted the internal audit division about the investigation, according to Kane. The audit division then “confirmed it would initiate its own investigation to examine any controls that either failed or were non-existent that allowed for the exploitation to occur.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three employees of the Roanoke store were ultimately prosecuted and, according to court documents, convicted of embezzlement in Roanoke Circuit Court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four officials placed on administrative leave are not mentioned in the report, despite the incident ostensibly being a primary reason for their leave. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the audit division completed its report Sept. 13, 2022, ABC officials have insisted they did not see the document until Feb. 14, 2023.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first we became aware of it was February of this year when the second instance of the suspend transaction we became aware of,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chief Administrative Officer David Alfano at the May 30 meeting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC Chief Retail Operations Officer Mark Dunham agreed during the meeting the report had not been issued to the appropriate people and “sat around,” but said the authority has made “extensive efforts to make sure that it doesn’t happen again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Hugo responded that he was still “perplexed that you’ve got not a single email for the five page report that sat out there and nobody saw it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kane told the Mercury ABC leadership didn’t see the report until February 2023 “due to a failure in the process to issue the report.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The former Director of Internal Audit departed the organization on September 1, 2022, prior to the date on the report,” he wrote in an email. “The action of issuing the report did not occur during the transition between the director and acting director. The individual serving in the acting director role left the organization as of January 5, 2023. … It was not until misuse of the vulnerability was reported at a different store in February 2023 that the existence of the report came to light.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kane said that “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to avoid a similar process failure in the future, issuance of reports will now be tracked in Internal Audit’s auditing software, Audit Board.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the February 2023 thefts were detected, ABC’s enforcement and internal audit divisions launched an effort to find vulnerabilities in the authority’s systems, including reviewing video from a nine-day period at 34 stores. The investigation found “a total of seven stores experienced theft through the identified system and process vulnerability over the last 12 months,” said Kane. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC said six of those stores are currently under investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last week’s ABC board meeting, other board members suggested Hugo was dredging up old business that had been settled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m trying to figure out why we&#8217;re rehashing this again at this point,” said board member Mark Rubin. “Is there something that you know that we ought to be looking at differently?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board Vice Chair Maria Everett said, in her experience, the authority acknowledges problems “and our goal is to fix them and move forward.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And I think that’s been done over and over on this issue,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hugo indicated he was unconvinced only a few people within ABC knew about the September report and said he had been hearing lots of concern about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s bubbling up,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury sent ABC a list of questions this week following up on several public records requests submitted to the authority, giving officials until Tuesday evening to respond. Less than half an hour after sending its response, ABC issued a press release saying it was taking a “proactive” and “multipronged” approach to prevent theft and other inventory losses.</span></p>

(Skyhobo / Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This spring has seen increased bickering in Northern Virginia over two little-known aviation regulations called the slot and perimeter rules, which govern operations at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington County. What exactly are they — and why are people fighting over them? Read on to figure out what you need to know. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is the perimeter rule? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The perimeter rule limits the distance of nonstop flights to and from Reagan National to 1,250 miles — roughly the distance westward to Kansas and Nebraska and as far north as Quebec and Newfoundland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially set at 650 miles in 1966 and then later increased, the perimeter was intended to help reduce congestion at Reagan National and encourage use of the much larger Dulles International Airport in Fairfax and Loudoun counties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rule allowed Congress to pass exemptions to the perimeter, which it has done three times, in 2000, 2003 and 2012. (Congress has a special interest in both Reagan National and Dulles because the federal government owns them, with operations managed by the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority, known as MWAA.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those exemptions have opened up Reagan to 40 daily flights — or 20 round trips — to and from Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin and San Juan. A </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-176.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">November 2020 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found these flights increased passenger traffic at Reagan National and “likely reduced” some of the airport’s existing capacity. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35424" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:719px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GAO_Reagan_map.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-35424" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GAO_Reagan_map.jpg" alt="" width="719" height="560" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GAO_Reagan_map.jpg 719w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/GAO_Reagan_map-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Beyond-perimeter flight exemptions at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. (U.S. Government Accountability Office)</p></figure>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What is the slot rule?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slot rule, also called the high-density rule, was created in 1969 to control congestion at five high-traffic airports, including Reagan National. It requires airlines to obtain a “slot,” or authorization, for every takeoff from and landing at the airport; Reagan is currently limited to a maximum of 67 slots per hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slots are allocated by the Federal Aviation Administration, and the GAO noted in its 2020 report that “airlines consider their slots and slot exemptions to be valuable assets.” In 2009, JetBlue co-founder Dave Barger pitched then-Gov. Tim Kaine on a proposal to let airlines “slide” more slots between different hours of the day, arguing it would give more low-cost airlines access to the airport. The Kaine administration directed Barger to discuss the idea with the MWAA.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why do some people want to change the rules?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Debates over the slot and perimeter rules aren’t new. They typically occur every five years when Congress reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration, which it’s slated to do by the end of September. But this year the issue is getting more attention after U.S. Reps. Hank Johnson of Georgia and Burgess Owens of Utah introduced </span><a href="https://hankjohnson.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressmen-johnson-owens-introduce-bipartisan-bill-modernize-dca-air" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last month to add 28 additional flights to Reagan National both within and beyond its current perimeter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Five years ago there wasn’t as much of an organized effort,” said Brian Walsh, a Fairfax resident who serves as the spokesperson for the </span><a href="https://capitalaccessalliance.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital Access Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a coalition of business organizations that most notably includes Delta Air Lines. Since then, he says, “more people are flying than ever before” and the population in Northern Virginia and around Dulles has grown. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nothing has been changed in a number of years, and so with this year’s authorization bill, we see an opportunity to modernize what many of us see as an antiquated” system, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Capital Access Alliance has mounted an aggressive campaign to get Congress to authorize the additional flights, which </span><a href="https://capitalaccessalliance.com/the-issue/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it argues</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will allow up to 1 million more passengers to fly to and from locations outside the perimeter, drive down ticket prices and create over 1,000 new jobs. An </span><a href="https://capitalaccessalliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DCA-Air-Service-Analysis.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the group concludes Reagan National is “under-utilizing its capacity compared to other major airports in the top ten U.S. metros” and prior additions of beyond-perimeter flights there have “not negatively impacted the overall passenger growth at” Dulles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dulles is fully equipped to survive on its own. There are hundreds of thousands of people who live around it today,” said Walsh. “This is about giving air travelers more choices.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Why do others want to keep the current system in place? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone agrees. A counter-organization known as the </span><a href="https://www.protectregionalairports.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coalition to Protect America’s Regional Airports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has emerged to oppose the proposal, saying adding flights from Reagan National “would create unnecessary gridlock, threaten jobs and local businesses, risk connectivity for countless communities, and increase congestion, delays, and noise.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coalition, which includes the MWAA as well as United Airlines, several Virginia chambers of commerce and 17 Virginia airports, points in its defense to a <a href="https://punchbowl.news/2023-05-25-dca-air-service-analysis-memo/" target="_blank">May 25 memo</a> from the Federal Aviation Administration that called the Capital Access Alliance report &#8220;flawed.&#8221; Instead, the FAA wrote, additional flights &#8220;would likely have a negative impact on operational performance and passenger experience,&#8221; and Reagan National &#8220;is more delay prone than most other airports.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, argued coalition director Scott York in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230531005605/en/Community-and-Industry-Leaders-Launch-Coalition-to-Protect-America%E2%80%99s-Regional-Airports#:~:text=The%20Coalition%20to%20Protect%20America's%20Regional%20Airports%20(CPARA)%20strongly%20believes,convenient%2C%20and%20sustainable%20air%20travel." target="_blank">release</a> on the group’s formation, “if the slot and perimeter rules are removed or changed, airlines will be incentivized to replace routes that promote and sustain nationwide connectivity with longer-haul, more profitable flights.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These lost connections will have a significant impact on the local communities that rely on regional airports for economic development as well as safe and convenient travel.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MWAA contends that Reagan National is already operating at full capacity and has the busiest runway in the nation, with 819 daily takeoffs and landings on average. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While [Reagan National] is very popular because of its proximity to Capitol Hill, it simply cannot accommodate all the flights that airlines want to send to Washington,” said MWAA President and CEO Jack Potter in </span><a href="https://www.mwaa.com/news/reagan-nationals-runway-busiest-america" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urging Congress to reject the increases. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What&#8217;s next? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debate could continue at least through the summer. The current FAA authorization is set to expire at the end of September, but it’s not unusual for Congress to extend the deadline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walsh said the Capital Access Alliance is currently focused on “educating” the public and members of Congress about the newest slot and perimeter proposal. It will have to win over a number of key votes, including those of Virginia’s U.S. senators, Democrats Mark Warner and Kaine. This spring, the two joined with Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen to convey their “</span><a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/4/9/49ead862-0902-49d7-9036-53c1bfb50645/40E457F1E378029BF96E5F1FDB6AADF7.2023.03.10-final-slots-and-perimeter-letter.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strong opposition to any attempts at changing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” the current slot and perimeter rules. Virginia&#8217;s six Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives <a href="https://hoyer.house.gov/media/press-releases/hoyer-joins-congressional-colleagues-opposing-increased-dca-traffic" target="_blank">are also opposing the measure</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the expansion of Metro access to Dulles, long-distance flights from the Washington region have never been more accessible or competitive,” Warner and Kaine wrote in an April statement. “The slot and perimeter rules help to balance consistent world-class aviation services at the region’s three major airports, which has in turn allowed for billions of dollars in private-sector capital investment in the metropolitan Washington area.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am satisfied with the extension and hopeful that we will reach an agreement soon,” said Chesapeake Regional Healthcare President and CEO Reese Jackson in a statement announcing the extension Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision means that Hampton Roads residents who have Cigna insurance through their employers will still be able to get in-network coverage for services from Chesapeake Regional, a public hospital in Virginia’s second-largest city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the country’s largest health insurers, Cigna controlled about 3.5% of Virginia’s health insurance market in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has been embroiled in </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/19/contract-dispute-threatens-relationship-between-cigna-and-chesapeake-hospital/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a disagreement with Chesapeake Regional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since September, when it notified the hospital it planned to terminate its contract over concern about what it described as high reimbursement rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to keep health care affordable, especially as our clients and customers are managing rising prices due to inflation,” the insurer said in a statement to the Mercury this May. “Unfortunately, the majority of services that our customers access at Chesapeake General are more expensive than other local hospitals, and each year their rate increases have outpaced other area hospitals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake Regional has said it is “simply untrue” that its services cost more across the board than those offered at other health care facilities. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Friday, the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources announced that 24,447 turkeys were killed during the 2023 spring turkey season, breaking the previous record of 20,580 turkeys set in 2015 by almost 19%.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a href="https://dwr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/media/2023-Spring-Turkey-Harvest-by-County.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agency data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about two-thirds of the turkeys were hunted east of the Blue Ridge. The counties that bagged the most were: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bedford County (691 turkeys)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southampton County (679 turkeys)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franklin County (602 turkeys)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counties that saw the biggest bumps in harvest since the 2021-22 year were: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frederick County (69% increase; 474 turkeys)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah County (65% increase; 452 turkeys)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buckingham County (63% increase; 287 turkeys)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Technically, the largest jumps were seen in a handful of cities, with Newport News experiencing a 500% increase. However, all of those municipalities’ harvest numbers were in the single digits both this year and last, making the comparison less meaningful.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After nearly becoming extinct, wild turkeys are managed in the commonwealth through the </span><a href="https://dwr.virginia.gov/wp-content/uploads/turkey-management-plan.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Wild Turkey Management Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The current 10-year plan was crafted in 2013 and is currently undergoing revision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although many states within the region are reporting declining spring turkey harvests and populations, Virginia seems to be a bright spot regionally,” noted a Friday release from DWR. “Four of the top 5 turkey harvests have occurred since 2020, indicating that populations appear to be robust.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move would mean that Chesapeake Regional, a public hospital in the state’s second-largest city, would no longer be considered in-network for people in the Hampton Roads region who have Cigna insurance through their employers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Cigna said the company is pulling out of the contract because “the majority of services that our customers access at Chesapeake General are more expensive than other local hospitals, and each year their rate increases have outpaced other area hospitals.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake General is the former name of Chesapeake Regional Medical Center, which was rebranded in 2010. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake Regional flatly denies its costs are higher than those at other hospitals, calling the assertion “simply untrue” in a recent press release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve asked them for proof of that,” said Reese Jackson, president and CEO of Chesapeake Regional Healthcare, the health system that includes the hospital. However, he said Cigna has not offered specific evidence to show the costs of the hospital’s services are higher across the board, although it has notified its members of the pending termination, citing price concerns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I took offense to them sending a letter to their members,” said Jackson. “We’re a standalone hospital. We don’t have the bargaining power of larger systems.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He contended Chesapeake Regional is “not unreasonable in our pricing structure.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have the same prices as Inova or HCA,” he said, referring to large hospital systems in Northern and central Virginia. “I can promise you that Cigna pays Inova and HCA more than us.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cigna, which controlled about 3.5% of Virginia’s health insurance market in 2021, according to </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/getattachment/bdd32943-0f9b-441c-9223-e0cd40ab6432/as.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Corporation Commission data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, did not respond to a request for information about Chesapeake Regional prices in comparison to other hospital prices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its statement, Cigna said it would “continue negotiating and hope that they will do what is best for the community we both serve to reach a fair agreement before our contract ends June 1. If Chesapeake General refuses to agree to a reasonable, affordable contract, we will help our customers find other quality, in-network providers nearby.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake Regional and Cigna have had a contract for what Reese said is over two decades. On Sept. 30, however, the insurer notified the hospital it planned to terminate that agreement. Both agreed in January to extend the term of the contract through the end of May, with negotiations occurring throughout the late winter and spring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Reese said “there’s always hope” an agreement will be reached, he said the hospital system is already budgeting for a loss of Cigna members and expects the insurer’s withdrawal to harm its financial situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disagreements over reimbursement rates in recent years have led to other insurers pulling out of contracts with Virginia hospitals. In 2018, Augusta Health left the Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield network after </span><a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/augusta-health-gathers-community-support-contract-dispute-anthem" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a contract dispute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which the Fishersville-based hospital accused the insurer of paying it lower reimbursement rates than other area hospitals. The hospital and insurer reached a </span><a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2018/06/30/anthem-back-augusta-health/747897002/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new four-year deal in June 2018</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A </span><a href="https://www.rappnews.com/news/health/anthem-of-virginia-could-end-insurance-relationship-with-valley-health/article_1c0745c4-04f5-11eb-ac9f-b3bee49ff898.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar dispute between Anthem and Valley Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Shenandoah Valley nearly led to the end of their contract in 2020, although an agreement was eventually reached. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospitals like Chesapeake Regional have argued they are facing higher expenses due to increasing labor, drug and supply costs. The </span><a href="https://www.kaufmanhall.com/sites/default/files/2023-05/KH-NHFR_2023-04.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from health care analytics and consulting firm Kaufman Hall found that while hospital profit margins are stabilizing, “increased material costs associated with drugs and supplies as a result of inflationary pressures continue to negatively hospital margins.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Margins “continue to sit at razor-thin, near-zero levels, putting hospitals in a vulnerable position should a recession or a new public health emergency materialize,” the report noted. </span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia turned down a request by Wegmans to reconsider a February decision that found neighbors had a right to challenge local approvals of the grocery giant’s plans to build a massive distribution center in Hanover County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The denial, issued May 11, was terse and offered no explanation of the reasoning of the judges, whose earlier decision in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan v. Board of Supervisors of Hanover County</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was unanimously in favor of the neighbors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are gratified that once again the Court has unanimously declared that Wegmans is wrong,” Brian Buniva, the attorney for Roderick Morgan and four other Hanover residents, said in a text message. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What practical implications the ruling will have for the Hanover project are unclear. The distribution center is nearly complete and expected to begin operations this summer, even as the Supreme Court of Virginia decision sends the case back to a lower court for further review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are no approvals from the County contingent upon resolution of this case at the Circuit Court,” said Hanover spokeswoman Kristin Smith Dunlop in an email. “As there are no court orders directing the County to withhold permits, inspections, or approvals — such as the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for this facility — the County will continue to process these requests as they would for any applicant or property owner.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans did not respond to a request for comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris French, a Hanover resident who has been involved with a separate lawsuit over the project, said Thursday’s decision “again affirmed citizens should have reasonable access to courts when challenging a zoning case.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Local governments throughout Virginia were overstepping when they sought to dismiss cases solely on legal standing when the required criteria was obviously met,” he said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wegmans distribution center in Hanover has been beset by legal challenges since the local Board of Supervisors approved it in May 2020. Expected to create 700 jobs, the project garnered tax credits and $2.35 million in state incentives under former Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, many neighbors, including the Brown Grove community founded by freedpeople after the Civil War, have staunchly opposed the development on the grounds that it will destroy wetlands and cause major traffic and noise and light pollution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Morgan case ended up at the state Supreme Court after Hanover Circuit Court found five residents whose property lay within 1,000 feet of the new facility had no standing to challenge the county’s approval of the project because they hadn’t demonstrated they would suffer “particularized harm” from it. The neighbors, who had argued the board violated multiple local ordinances and state laws in its approval, appealed that decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/02/supreme-court-of-va-rules-hanover-residents-can-sue-over-wegmans-warehouse/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled in favor of the property owners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this February and sent the case back to Hanover Circuit.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have no difficulty concluding that the allegations of particularized harm made by the homeowners are fairly traceable to the Board’s 2020 decision,” wrote Justice D. Arthur Kelsey. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/21/wegmans-business-groups-ask-virginia-supreme-court-to-overturn-hanover-ruling/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans’ petition for the court to reconsider that ruling was supported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 21 major real estate, housing, local government and business groups, who in an amicus brief had contended the court’s February ruling “will have disastrous consequences for all types of development in Virginia.”  </span></p>

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of abortion providers, including two clinics in Charlottesville and Alexandria, are suing the Food and Drug Administration in an effort to block potential new restrictions on the use of the abortion pill mifepristone in Virginia, Montana and Kansas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case, which was </span><a href="https://reproductiverights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/WWH-v-FDA-Complaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, is the latest in a string of legal challenges related to the FDA’s approval of mifepristone, which is used as part of a two-drug regimen to terminate pregnancies up to about 10 weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/19/56-of-virginia-abortions-were-performed-via-medication-in-2021/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">56% of the roughly 17,000 abortions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that occurred in the state in 2021 were the result of medication. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order to meet the needs of their patients, Plaintiffs rely on the ability to prescribe medication abortion, which is safe and effective, less expensive and less resource-intensive than procedural abortion, and preferred by many patients,” states the suit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the groups who filed the lawsuit are Whole Woman’s Health Alliance, which operates a clinic that provides abortions in Charlottesville; Whole Woman’s Health, which operates a clinic providing abortions in Alexandria; and Whole Woman’s Health of the Twin Cities, which provides telehealth services for medication abortion in Virginia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico and Illinois. Other plaintiffs provide medication abortion services in Montana, Kansas and Oklahoma. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mifepristone has become the latest flashpoint in abortion debates after the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade and declared “the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the people and their elected representatives.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This April, a federal judge in Texas revoked federal approval of mifepristone in response to a challenge by anti-abortion group Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine arguing that the FDA hadn’t adequately reviewed the drug before approving it in 2000. The </span><a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-preserves-access-abortion-pill-lawsuit-continues" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Supreme Court later paused the ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until the broader case works through the appeals process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moments after the Texas decision, a federal judge in Washington state handed down a ruling in a separate case that temporarily blocked the FDA from “altering the status quo” on mifepristone in 17 states and the District of Columbia, which had argued the agency was imposing unnecessary regulations on the drug. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent case filed by the abortion providers would bring Virginia, Montana and Kansas in line with the 17 states and Washington, D.C. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Plaintiffs — independent abortion providers with limited resources in hostile states — are caught in the middle of this maelstrom,” the groups wrote. “They provide care in states that are party to neither case and are thus in a particularly precarious and uncertain provision. Plaintiffs cannot retool their practices overnight with no notice — healthcare has no on/off switch. They and their patients require clarity around their continued provision of mifepristone.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia currently allows abortion with few restrictions in the first and second trimesters and permits it in the third if three doctors decide continuing the pregnancy would impose a severe risk to the mother. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have sought to narrow that access since the overturning of Roe. But while Democratic control of the state Senate has stymied those efforts to date, all 140 seats in the legislature will be on the ballot this fall, with control of both chambers hanging in the balance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides asking the court to grant Virginia, Montana and Kansas the same protections for mifepristone access put in place by the Washington judge for the 17 other states, the abortion providers also challenge current restrictions placed by the FDA on the drug. Those include requirements that patients sign a special form prior to being prescribed mifepristone and that providers be certified to prescribe it.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those “burdensome restrictions,” the groups argue, make mifepristone “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">seem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> uniquely dangerous” while making it “harder for clinicians to prescribe, harder for pharmacies to dispense, and harder for patients to access.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://asmfc.org/uploads/file/64529753pr10AtlSripedBassEmergencyAction.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new limit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which went into effect May 3 and will last through Oct. 28, forbids recreational fishers in the Chesapeake Bay and along the coast from taking any striped bass more than 31 inches long, in an attempt to protect a robust population of the species born in 2015. It was imposed by the Striped Bass Management Board of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, the body that oversees all fishing in state waters along the East Coast.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Based on concern for the stock and the long-term interests of its stakeholders, the Board acted decisively to protect one of the few remaining strong year classes,” said board chair Marty Gary, who also serves on the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the emergency limits, the board also voted to begin considering whether changes should be made to current catch restrictions and season closures in both the recreational and commercial fisheries in order to help rebuild the Atlantic population. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recreational fishing pressure on striped bass is increasing just as the population is struggling to recover,” said Chris Moore, a scientist with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, in a statement. “Fish that are caught and released can die, especially if released in the summer when water temperatures are high and oxygen levels are low.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ASMFC boards are allowed to take emergency actions like this week’s new restrictions when public health and fisheries conservation goals have “been placed substantially at risk by unanticipated changes in the ecosystem, the stock, or the fishery.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The striped bass board had found that if death rates remained as high as they were during 2022, the probability that the spawning population could reach the 2029 targets set by regulators fell from 97% likelihood to 15%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Atkinson, president of the Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Association, said the striped bass declines have led to a situation of “either pay me now, or pay me more later.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always prefer the now option,” he said in an email. “This fishery has been in decline for years, and it is time that they took bold action to save it.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent </span><a href="https://news.wm.edu/2022/10/27/juvenile-striped-bass-abundance-remains-steady-in-virginia-waters/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research by William &amp; Mary’s Virginia Institute of Marine Science</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 2022 was “another average year” for the hatching of striped bass in Virginia tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Court of Appeals is asking a lower court to consider whether state law setting a local residency requirement for people collecting and witnessing signatures in support of a referendum violates political speech rights under the First Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams v. Legere et al.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, concerns an attempt by Williamsburg resident Margaret Williams to put a referendum on the November 2022 ballot on the question of whether members of the joint Williamsburg-James City County School Board who represent Williamsburg should be directly elected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The division is one of just 15 in Virginia where school boards are partially or fully appointed. While the five members of the seven-member Williamsburg-James City County board who represent the county are directly elected by residents, the two members who represent the city are appointed by city council. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/22.1-57.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law allows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voters to petition a circuit court to hold a referendum on whether their local school board should be directly elected. Virginia code requires that the petition be signed by at least 10% of the locality’s registered voters 111 days before the general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last June, Williams began collecting the 999 signatures needed for such a petition in Williamsburg. By the middle of July, she had submitted 1,587 signatures to the court, and City Registrar Tina Reitzel later determined 1,246 were qualified city voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the registrar found only 64 of the signatures met statutory requirements for a referendum because the people who witnessed the remaining signatures — the people circulating the petition — were residents of either James City County or York County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reitzel’s determination was based on a different </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-684.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">provision of state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring that all signatures collected on a petition for a referendum “shall be witnessed by a person who is qualified to vote, or qualified to register to vote, in the referendum for which he is circulating the petition.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams then sued three members of the Williamsburg Electoral Board and the city registrar, arguing state law was severely limiting her First Amendment rights. The city of Williamsburg intervened, arguing that the requirement protected “the integrity of the referendum process … by requiring that those driving the change and circulating the petition are would-be voters of the referendum itself.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the joint Williamsburg-James City County Circuit Court ruled in favor of the city, Williams appealed the case to the Virginia Court of Appeals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On May 2, the higher court reversed that decision and asked the circuit court to analyze whether the residency requirement in state law “is necessary and narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.vacourts.gov/opinions/opncavwp/1225221.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opinion by Judge Kimberley Slayton White</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> noted the U.S. Supreme Court has previously found “that the distribution of referendum petitions is a protected right to speech under the First Amendment and that any limitation on political expression is subject to ‘exacting scrutiny.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Williamsburg case, “the City wishes to enforce a requirement which would cut down the number of political message carriers, thus limiting the audience Williams may reach,” wrote White. “Such a requirement substantially restricts Williams’ ability to engage in ‘core political speech. Because this restriction on political speech is a clear deprivation of a right guaranteed in the First Amendment, courts must subject it to strict scrutiny.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White also pointed to U.S. Supreme Court decisions striking down various requirements linked to the circulation of petitions, such as requirements that a person circulating a petition for a ballot initiative be a registered voter and wear an identification badge, as “impermissible restrictions on the fundamental free speech right of political expression as guaranteed by the First Amendment.” </span></p>
<p>Nicole Trifone, a spokesperson for the city of Williamsburg, said the city had no comment on the ruling.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of medication abortion has been rising in Virginia over the past seven years, with more than half of all abortions in the state induced with pills rather than performed by surgery in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data from the Virginia Department of Health, 56% of the roughly 17,000 induced terminations of pregnancy — the state’s legal term for abortion — that occurred in the state in 2021 were the result of medication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That number has been steadily rising since 2015, when over 27% of the more than 18,600 induced terminations in Virginia were through medication. Virginia women’s increasing reliance on medication to terminate pregnancies is also in line with national trends: According to data from the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/health/abortion-pills-us.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">54% of all U.S. abortions in 2020 were performed via medication</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rather than surgery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Just gradually over time we’ve seen more and more patients choosing this route,” said Dr. Shanthi Ramesh, chief medical director for the Virginia League for Planned Parenthood. “We are really seeing patients for medication abortion almost every day of the week at our sites.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But abortion in Virginia could look very different if courts uphold parts of a ruling by a federal judge in Texas to halt or limit the Food and Drug Administration’s more than two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, which is used along with misoprostol to terminate pregnancy up to 10 weeks. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_35023" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1197px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Va_medication_abortion_data.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-35023 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Va_medication_abortion_data.jpg" alt="" width="1197" height="558" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Va_medication_abortion_data.jpg 1197w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Va_medication_abortion_data-300x140.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Va_medication_abortion_data-1024x477.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Va_medication_abortion_data-768x358.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1197px) 100vw, 1197px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (Virginia Department of Health)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The April 7 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk effectively called for a halt to the sale of mifepristone across the U.S. by April 15. Both the U.S. Department of Justice and the manufacturer of a brand-name version of mifepristone, Danco Laboratories, asked the higher U.S. 5th Circuit of Appeals to put that decision on hold but were only partly successful. While the court agreed to continue allowing the sale of the drug on the grounds that the statute of limitations to challenge the original 2000 FDA approval had run out, it let stand other provisions of the Texas ruling that will significantly narrow access to the medication by </span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/04/13/texas-fda-abortion-drugs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upholding certain restrictions on its use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that were in place prior to 2016. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those restrictions, which are set to go into effect at 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, will among other changes only allow mifepristone to be used through the seventh week of pregnancy and will bar it from being prescribed via telehealth or mailed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the Department of Justice and Danco Laboratories have made an emergency request to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to uphold the FDA approval of the drug. The court is expected to act by Wednesday night. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/07/us/court-decision-keeping-mifepristone-available.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate ruling by a federal judge in Washington state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, handed down minutes after the April 7 Texas decision, temporarily blocked the FDA from “altering the status quo” with regard to mifepristone in 17 states and Washington, D.C. that had argued the agency was imposing unnecessary regulations on the drug. However, Virginia is not a party to that case, meaning it will not be affected by the ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13 states have banned most abortions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer, Virginia’s divided government has meant </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/20/republican-senator-breaks-with-gop-to-oppose-15-week-abortion-bill-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans have made little headway</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to date in rolling back the state’s expansive abortion rights. Virginia places few restrictions on abortion in the first and second trimesters and allows the procedure in the third if three doctors decide continuing the pregnancy would pose a severe risk to the mother. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, if upheld, the new limits on mifepristone are poised to be the most consequential narrowing of abortion access the state has seen since the court’s Dobbs decision overturning Roe. And because mifepristone is only authorized for use up to 10 weeks of pregnancy — or, under the restrictions allowed by the appeals court, seven weeks — its biggest impacts in Virginia will be seen among women seeking to end a pregnancy during the first trimester. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramesh said that regardless of the Supreme Court’s decision, Planned Parenthood is “committed to providing medication abortion in Virginia” and would continue to offer it under the more restrictive regulations or by </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/11/health/misoprostol-abortion.html?name=styln-abortion-pills&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;variant=undefined" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relying solely on misoprostol</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the second of the two-pill medication abortion regimen approved by the FDA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not going anywhere,” she said. “Abortion is not going anywhere, and abortion providers are, for better or for worse, very good at contorting themselves to meet the needs of patients.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The woman, Danaesha Martin, said in the suit filed Friday, April 7 in Portsmouth Circuit Court that the deputy ordered the detainees to expose themselves as a condition of obtaining sanitary products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The provision of a sanitary napkin, pad, and/or tampon by a correctional officer to a female detainee/inmate is a mere ministerial function that in no way requires the exercise of discretion,” reads Martin’s suit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a copy of an email obtained by the Mercury, Portsmouth City Jail Chief Deputy of Jail Operations Lt. Col. Dorothy Dildy-Clemons wrote deputies shortly after the alleged May 2 incident that “at no time are you to ask female inmates to pulled [sic] down their pants and undergarments to visually see if they are on their cycle.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This can become a PREA issue that can escalate into a lawsuit,” wrote Dildy-Clemons, presumably referring to the </span><a href="https://bja.ojp.gov/program/prea/overview" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal Prison Rape Elimination Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “This is to stop immediately, expeditiously!!!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dildy-Clemons noted in the same email that the jail had “plenty” of sanitary products and directed deputies to log the names of inmates receiving such products and the quantity used. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marvin Waters, an undersheriff in the Portsmouth Sheriff’s Office, said Dildy-Clemons’ email was sent in response to a rumor and not an official report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What the lieutenant colonel was doing was putting something out there about it to say, ‘Hey, this is something we do not do,’” he said. “There was never an official report of an incident that had occurred.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waters said the sheriff’s office doesn’t comment on pending litigation and plans to file a response within the next 30 days. He also said Dildy-Clemons&#8217; description of the procedure used to provide detainees with sanitary products accurately reflects the jail&#8217;s ongoing policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really wish I could speak on it more, but once all the facts in the lawsuit come out, a lot of viewpoints on the matter will definitely change,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin is accusing the sheriff and the deputy, variously called “Katherine Adams,” “Catherine Adams” and “RC Adams,” among other spellings, of sexual abuse, gross negligence and wilful and wanton misconduct, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under state code, sexual abuse is defined as “an act committed with the intent to sexually molest, arouse, or gratify any person” in four specific situations, including when “the accused forces another person to touch the complaining witness’s intimate parts or material directly covering such intimate parts.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin is seeking $1 million in compensatory damages and $350,000 in punitive damages, as well as attorney’s fees and costs. She is being represented by Mark Dix, an attorney with the Richmond-based Dix Law Firm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of the alleged events, Martin was being held at Portsmouth City Jail on charges of malicious wounding and conspiracy to maliciously wound in connection to </span><a href="http://kwayradio.com/woman-arrested-while-awaiting-sentencing-for-cousins-murder/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the shooting of a man and the striking of a woman by a vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Portsmouth. The charges were later dropped. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, she was awaiting sentencing in a separate case related to the November 2018 death of her cousin, Shavondes Martin, in Waterloo, Iowa. While she was originally charged with first-degree murder in that death, Martin agreed to plead guilty to a lesser conspiracy charge and testify against a man accused of shooting her cousin. This past October, </span><a href="https://wcfcourier.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/prison-sentence-handed-down-for-woman-who-lured-her-cousin-to-his-death/article_9ec942b4-5dd7-570a-9650-27dea0664918.html#:~:text=The%20decision%2C%20handed%20down%20Wednesday,said%20upon%20hearing%20the%20sentence." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a judge sentenced Martin to up to 10 years in prison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dix said his law firm was retained last summer to represent Martin in the Portsmouth City Jail case but the Portsmouth Sheriff’s Office did not respond to requests for documents under the state Freedom of Information Act for several months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dix filed a separate lawsuit against the sheriff in January 2023 asking Portsmouth Circuit Court to require the office to comply with the FOIA request. He said he then received a response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Court records show the FOIA case was dismissed Feb. 15. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women’s use of sanitary products in jails and prisons has sparked a string of legal cases in Virginia and other states in recent years. In 2018, the Virginia Department of Corrections </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-prison-bans-female-visitors-from-wearing-tampons/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">instituted a policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forbidding female visitors to state prisons from wearing tampons, citing concerns about the women instead smuggling in contraband. The agency later rolled the policy back, although some department officials told the General Assembly in 2019 that women wearing tampons were </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/prison-officials-say-theyre-still-blocking-women-wearing-tampons-from-full-visitation-privileges-over-contraband-concerns/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only being allowed no-contact visitation with inmates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This September, a jury in federal district court </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/20/virginia-prison-agency-discriminated-against-female-employee-in-tampon-case-jury-rules/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found VADOC had discriminated against a former employee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who was fired after a body scanner detected a tampon she was wearing, causing officials to suspect she was carrying contraband into the prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tennessee, a lawsuit between the nation’s largest private prison operator, CoreCivic, and female prison visitors ordered to remove tampons or sanitary pads to prove they were menstruating </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/7fd362260ce54d15b2642d3d9d023fbd" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was settled in a confidential agreement in 2017</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The women had said guards forced them to expose their genitals as proof. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This story is an updated and expanded version of our </span></i><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/21/general-assembly-tracker-everyone-who-says-they-arent-coming-back-next-year/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Assembly Tracker</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s never-sleepy political calendar, April 6 was a red-letter day: the last day for candidates affiliated with a party to file paperwork announcing their intention to run for office in the June primaries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary filing deadline is always a watershed moment for determining who’s likely to be on the ballot in November. But 2023 will see an unusual level of turnover in the oldest legislative body in the Western Hemisphere. Not only is every one of Virginia’s 140 General Assembly seats up for election, but redistricting has radically rejiggered the state’s political landscape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning this winter, a growing number of senators and delegates began announcing this session would be their last. Some of the announcements were expected. A handful of older, long-term representatives like Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, were effectively retiring after years in the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2023 election cycle will be the first under the new legislative maps drawn in the independent redistricting process of 2021. Because those maps gave less protection to incumbents, several lawmakers were drawn into the same district as one or more colleagues. That dynamic is partly fueling the retirement wave, as some lawmakers choose to step down rather than face a primary or compete in a dramatically different district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Altogether, 28 legislators are waving farewell to the Capitol. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Farewell House … hello Senate?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not just retirements that will leave vacancies in the General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fourteen delegates have announced their intention to run for the state Senate. Whether they will make it to the Senate isn’t clear, but what is clear is that their departure from the House will further shake up its composition. Here’s who is gambling on being able to move into the upper chamber.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Del. Tim Anderson, R-Virginia Beach</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A firebrand conservative who flipped a competitive Hampton Roads district in 2021, Anderson earlier this year said he would not seek reelection in a new district that now includes the Eastern Shore and Del. Rob Bloxom, R-Accomack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 4, Anderson announced on Facebook he will be running for the new Senate District 19, a strongly Republican-leaning district that covers parts of Virginia Beach and Chesapeake.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bagby has already left the House to fill out the term of former state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, who was sworn into Congress in early March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the eight-year delegate and chair of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus easily won the contest for McClellan’s seat, he will have to run again this November in a new Richmond-area district laid out in the new maps. </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Emily Brewer, R-Isle of Wight</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elected to the House in 2017 in a Tidewater district encompassing Isle of Wight, Prince George, Surry and parts of Suffolk, Brewer chairs the House Communications, Technology and Innovation Committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her race against former NASCAR driver and truck stop owner Hermie Sadler to represent the new Senate District 17 has already</span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/03/29/judge-orders-primary-in-brewer-sadler-contest-for-republican-state-senate-nomination-in-southside/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provoked a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over whether the choice of a nominee should occur through a state-run primary or a party-run convention.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Durant was first elected to the House in 2021, </span><a href="https://fredericksburg.com/news/local/republican-durant-takes-house-district-28-seat-from-del-joshua-cole/article_094fbde9-7c76-5276-8582-e0a8b8ed65bf.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unseating incumbent Democrat Josh Cole</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Senate District 27 seat she’s seeking now to represent parts of Stafford, Spotsylvania and Fredericksburg </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/state-senate-27/elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leans Republican</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but has a wide-open field of candidates. In a Republican primary, Durant will face Matt Strickland, the owner of a Fredericksburg restaurant that openly flouted COVID-19 restrictions and was </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/after-restaurant-raid-youngkin-says-state-should-stop-enforcing-covid-19-violations/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raided by Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority agents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Elizabeth Guzman, D-Prince William</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guzman joined the House in 2018 after</span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/news/election/guzman-defeats-8-term-incumbent-in-31st-district/article_b32f4600-c433-11e7-bcc0-27078ebfeec3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unseating long-time Republican Del. Scott Lingamfelter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a rapidly changing district covering parts of Prince William and Fauquier. In 2020-21, she sought the lieutenant governorship in a crowded primary before </span><a href="https://www.fauquier.com/news/del-elizabeth-guzman-withdraws-from-lieutenant-governors-race/article_d73c23fc-9f99-11eb-bc90-c752cf676e14.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fundraising results spurred her to withdraw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redistricting left Guzman in the same House district as Del. Luke Torian, who under Democratic control of the House chaired the chamber’s powerful Appropriations Committee. This December, </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/guzman-announces-primary-challenge-to-state-sen-mcpike/article_1b4500aa-7ad6-11ed-a147-cf2a84f87ec4.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guzman announced she would challenge Sen.

<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Chris Head, R-Roanoke</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After representing the Roanoke area in the House of Delegates for 17 years, Head is running for the new Senate District 3 this fall. Sen. Emmett Hanger’s announcement April 6 that he won’t also seek the nomination for the new district clears the path for Head in the firmly Republican area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice Chair of the House Committee on Health, Welfare, and Institutions, Head has pledged “to be a strong conservative voice for traditional Virginia values in Richmond.” </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Sally Hudson, D-Charlottesville</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An economist who teaches at the University of Virginia, Hudson was elected in 2019 to the House of Delegates, where she has staked out a position in the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party. </span></p>

Creigh Deeds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the party’s nominating contest for the Charlottesville-area seat in what’s expected to be one of the most closely watched primaries of the year. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Senate District 17 that resulted from the state-driven redistricting leans Republican. This November, Jenkins — who has no Democratic opponents — will face either Republican Del. Emily Brewer or former NASCAR driver and truck stop owner Hermie Sadler. </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Dave LaRock, R-Clarke</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A member of the House of Delegates since 2014, LaRock has staked out a position as one of the most conservative members of the House Republican caucus. He </span><a href="https://www.loudountimes.com/news/del-larock-lashes-out-at-critics-amid-growing-calls-to-resign/article_71860ed6-55b3-11eb-80e5-cf6a96e138fb.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">participated in the Jan. 6 Stop the Steal rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, although not the storming of the Capitol, and was one of three Republican members of the General Assembly to ask Vice President Mike Pence to nullify Virginia’s election results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The field of candidates LaRock will face in vying for the party nomination for the strongly Republican Senate District 1 is wide: </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/state-senate-1/elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven other candidates have thrown their hats in the ring</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. John McGuire, R-Henrico</b></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no other Democrats seeking the party nomination in Senate District 16, VanValkenburg is poised to take on Sen.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saslaw, who is 83 and will have chalked up 48 years in the General Assembly at the expiration of his term, said Feb. 23 he was closing the book on a political career that began in the House of Delegates and ended up with him </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/23/richard-saslaw-virginia-senator-retire/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling the Senate Democrats for 25 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norment told the paper he wanted to spend more time with family and go back to teaching, which he previously did at the College of William and Mary. Redistricting also left him in the same new district as Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filler-Corn made history in 2020 when she became the first woman elected speaker of the House of Delegates. After her party lost its majority in 2021 and she was deposed as the leader of her caucus, she’s leaving the House entirely after more than a decade of serving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I first joined the House of Delegates, I was one of only 19 women in the entire body and one of the only mothers of school-aged children,” Filler-Corn said in a statement announcing her decision not to run for the House in 2023. “Today, our caucus is the first majority woman caucus in Virginia’s history. As the first woman and Jewish Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, I proudly appointed more women and diverse individuals to leadership positions than in our entire Commonwealth’s history.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After redistricting, Filler-Corn ended up in the same Northern Virginia district as Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, who is now the only Democrat declared for the seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filler-Corn, long considered a possible candidate for statewide office, indicated she’s not quitting Virginia politics entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have made significant progress in Virginia and I will continue this work for our communities and our Commonwealth outside the confines of the House of Delegates,” Filler-Corn said. “As for my next chapter, there are many exciting options ahead and I look forward to sharing more in the coming weeks and months.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams, who was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2017, said </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/dels-bagby-adams-to-seek-senate-seat-if-mcclellan-goes-to-congress/article_0ffda4aa-95ec-11ed-8f39-370c7fbe530a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in February that she doesn’t plan to run for her seat again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in an April 1 newsletter said she also doesn’t plan to run for the new Senate District 14. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know this will come as a shock and perhaps an initial disappointment to many, but please know that I am still considering my next steps,” she wrote. “Despite this announcement, my intention to serve and my commitment to improving the commonwealth remains steadfast. There is still much work I would like to do in Richmond, and I look forward to my next chapter.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nurse practitioner, Adams has been especially active on health issues in the General Assembly. This February, she lost </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-virginia-state-government-richmond-37600759112a48b15292a0431ecc555a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a primary bid for the state Senate seat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vacated by U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan to Lamont Bagby, who was overwhelmingly elected to the position in a March general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redistricting would have pitted Adams against Dels. Jeff Bourne and Betsy Carr in a race to represent the 78th District in the House. Bourne said in February he wasn’t returning to the legislature.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. John Avoli, R-Staunton</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First elected in 2019, Avoli announced Feb. 25 that he won’t seek reelection in his western Virginia district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release, Avoli, a former member of the Staunton City Council, said he was “ready to retire after 49 years in public service.” He had previously indicated he would run again, but </span><a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2023/02/25/avoli-announces-he-wont-seek-reelection-to-house-of-delegates/69944513007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he told the Staunton News-Leader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he had changed his mind. The redrawn district he would have run in is safely Republican.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Sen. John Bell, D-Loudoun</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell, who joined the Senate in 2020 after several years in the House of Delegates, is not running again in his Northern Virginia district after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a news release, Bell said cancer treatment “will greatly impact my life going forward” while calling his prognosis “very positive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have a number of excellent treatment options I’m currently considering, and I’m very fortunate to have access to the world-class healthcare that is available in our area,” Bell said. “My doctors tell me that they are confident I will be able to be successfully treated and even cured. I’m thankful that my cancer has been caught so early, and I’m incredibly blessed to have a great team behind me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The district Bell would’ve run in is strongly Democratic. Shortly after Bell’s announcement, Del. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, announced he would run for the open Senate seat.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Rob Bell, R-Charlottesville</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First elected to the House in 2001, Bell announced his retirement Feb. 25, on the last day of the 2023 General Assembly. A former prosecutor, he has been one of Republicans’ leading voices on criminal justice issues, chairing the House Courts of Justice Committee and previously the Virginia State Crime Commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell was facing the prospect of competing in a significantly bluer district thanks to the new political map for the Charlottesville region.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Jeff Bourne, D-Richmond</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bourne, who was first elected to the House in 2017, said Feb. 20 he wouldn’t run again. While he </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/bourne-will-not-seek-re-election-to-house-opening-way-for-carr/article_296436dc-b146-11ed-9a14-9758d3726805.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told The Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that redistricting played “zero” role in his decision, the new maps would have pitted him against veteran Democratic Del. Betsy Carr in elections to represent the new 78th District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a Richmond mayoral election coming up in 2024, there’s been some speculation Bourne, a former Richmond School Board member and City Hall aide, might seek the capital city’s strong mayor job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m going to enjoy some time with my family,” he said when asked about his future plans. “Then figure out what, if anything, is next.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byron </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/kathy.byron.39" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told constituents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she wouldn’t seek reelection after 26 sessions on Feb. 26.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Passing legislation gives you a sense of accomplishment,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “Having that legislation succeed in improving people’s lives — sometimes in big ways, other times in small ones — provides a truly humbling gratification.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Byron currently chairs the House Commerce and Energy Committee and was the first woman to be elected chair of the House Republican Caucus. Under the new political maps, she would have faced Del. Wendell Walker, R-Lynchburg, to represent the district.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Jeff Campbell, R-Smyth</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First elected to the House of Delegates in 2013, Campbell said April 1 he will retire from representing his Southwest Virginia district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My season has now come and gone,” </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/04/01/del-jeff-campbell-retires-legislative-aide-arnold-announces-candidacy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Campbell in a release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “When I was sworn into the House in 2014, our family photo, taken in front of the Clerk’s dais, displays a young family with children in elementary school. Ten years later, those children are grown and have gone off to college. If I have any regrets from service, it is that I wasn’t there nearly enough during their formative years.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell, a lawyer, was one of three GOP members of the House who supported </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-legislature-is-one-procedural-vote-away-from-passing-legislation-abolishing-death-penalty/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">abolition of the death penalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Sen. John Cosgrove, R-Chesapeake</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying it was time to “pass the torch” to new leaders, Cosgrove announced he’s not running for the Senate again after two decades in the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have two precious granddaughters that I rarely get to see, and my wonderful wife Sue has been very patient with me serving so long in public service,” Cosgrove said in his March 20 announcement. “It is time to move on and enjoy my family and the opportunities that may lie ahead for me and my family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t immediately clear who in the GOP was lining up to try to succeed Cosgrove in the strongly Republican district. A Democrat, Myra Payne, has filed to run for the seat.</span></p>
<ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis, who has been in the House since 2014 and most recently served as chair of the House Education Committee, had been drawn into the same district as House Appropriations Chair Barry Knight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While my desire would be to continue serving the citizens of Virginia Beach in the House of Delegates and leading our education agenda, there is no doubt that the City I represent, as well as the Hampton Roads Region as a whole, has benefited greatly from having the Chairman of Appropriations as its representative,” Davis wrote. “It is for this reason that I will not be running for re-election.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was drawn into the same district as Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a farewell speech on the floor, Edmunds thanked his House colleagues for putting “humanity” above politics.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwards, who has served in the Senate since 1996, is not seeking another term after being put in a Republican-leaning district with Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I appreciate the many who have urged me to seek another term,” Edwards said in a news release. “I look forward to continuing my law practice and to spending time traveling and with my family.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwards recently served as co-chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement of his own, Suetterlein praised Edwards for his 28 years in the Senate and said the two have “a shared love of the Roanoke Valley.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First elected to the House in 2011, Fariss is currently facing several charges, including malicious wounding, after a March 2 incident in which a woman who said she had been in Fariss’ car alleges he deliberately struck her with the vehicle. Fariss has denied the allegations and was released on a $7,500 bond. </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Wendy Gooditis, D-Clarke</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gooditis, who represents a rural part of Northern Virginia, announced March 1 that she won’t seek another term after her current district was separated into three new ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After three hard-fought elections and six years in office, I feel I have served my time as Delegate,” she wrote in a press release that also called the new district where she resides “well-drawn” and “compact.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanger announced his exit from the General Assembly April 6, bringing an end to a long legislative career that began in 1983 in the House of Delegates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Widely seen as a moderate Republican who has been willing to break with his party in the Senate to side with Democrats on issues such as Medicaid expansion, Hanger found himself in the same district as veteran colleague Sen. Mark Obenshain following redistricting, triggering a drawn-out will-he-or-won’t-he debate in Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanger decided not to run against Obenshain in the new Senate District 2 this winter. Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for Senate Republicans, confirmed April 6 that Obenshain was the only Republican candidate to file for the party’s district primary before the deadline, “making him the Republican nominee in that district.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 6, Hanger also announced he wouldn’t run in the new Senate District 3, about half of which he currently represents and where he would be facing Del. Chris Head in a primary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I struggled with this decision because lots of people statewide have encouraged me to run again because of the loss of senior leadership in Richmond that is anticipated next year,” he wrote. “I went so far as to locate a house to purchase in SD3 but ultimately for personal, political and family reasons have decided not to move away from my current community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanger signaled, however, that he isn’t retiring from politics, noting he “will remain energetically involved” until the end of his term and will keep “all other options open to continue to serve.”</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howell, the influential co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, is retiring after more than three decades in the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My focus has always been on education, from preschool through graduate school and on helping our neighbors in need,” Howell said in a statement first reported by journalist Brandon Jarvis. “We have made great progress yet much more must be done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent sessions, Howell has been Senate Democrats’ lead budget negotiator, putting her in a key role to get policy concessions from Republicans as Gov. Glenn Youngkin pushes for tax cuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The redistricting process had left Howell in the same Northern Virginia district as Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Loudoun.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Kaye Kory, D-Falls Church</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 14 years in the House of Delegates, Kory announced on April 3 that she had made the “difficult decision” to retire at the end of her term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kory, who had been </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/another-northern-virginia-delegate-announces-retirement-clears-way-for-marcus-simon-in-13th/article_6c512960-d21a-11ed-90c0-6320e83f2c34.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drawn into the same legislative district as Del. Marcus Simon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Falls Church, said her husband was “facing some health challenges to which I want to devote my full attention.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am grateful to him and to my children for making our home a team environment that empowered me to pursue public office, and now I want to be there for them,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her time in the House, Kory founded the Women’s Health Care Caucus, and she was also active on animal welfare and developmental disability issues.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Sen. Lynwood Lewis, D-Accomack</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the Senate Democrats most imperiled by redistricting, Lewis announced he won’t run against Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, in a significantly redder district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis has served in the Senate since 2014, when he narrowly won a special election for the state Senate being vacated by former Gov. Ralph Northam, who at the time had just been elected lieutenant governor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement announcing his decision, Lewis noted he has represented “vastly different” parts of the state in a district that extended from Norfolk to the rural Eastern Shore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In all my years of service, I always sought common ground even in times of turmoil, and I believe the opportunity to serve such a diverse district made me a better legislator and a better person,” Lewis said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis said he’s hopeful there will be “other opportunities to serve” in his future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Democrat, Victoria Luevanos, has filed to run in the district.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 17 years in the General Assembly, McClellan departed the legislature this winter to fill the 4th Congressional District seat left vacant by the death of U.S. Rep. Donald McEachin in November. After defeating Republican pastor Leon Benjamin in a Feb. 21 election, she became the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/mcclellan-beats-benjamin-in-special-election-for-virginia-congressional-seat/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first Black woman to be elected to Congress from Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A corporate attorney who has backed progressive causes like combating climate change and protecting abortion access, McClellan also ran for governor in 2021 but came in third in the Democratic primary. The candidacy ultimately went to former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who lost the race to Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Mike Mullin, D-Newport News</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An influential voice on courts and criminal justice issues, Mullin isn’t running again after redistricting left him in a Republican-friendly district that would be tough for any Democrat to win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mullin, who was first elected to the House in 2015, said he planned to spend more time with his family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tragedy struck shortly after his announcement as Mullin announced the death of his </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/government/virginia/vp-nw-statehouse-newportnews-mullin-20230223-fqpaskq7jbhotjqtvqsksaj4ka-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3-month-old son</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, news that left some General Assembly members visibly shaken as they finished up their work for the year.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Kathleen Murphy, D-Fairfax</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First elected to the House in 2015, Murphy was drawn into a Northern Virginia district with Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Arlington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really don’t know what the words should be. I’m going to miss you,” Murphy said on the House floor as she announced her decision to leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After losing a brother to gun violence, Murphy has been one of House Democrats’ top advocates for stronger gun control laws. </span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Sen. Steve Newman, R-Bedford</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newman announced his retirement in mid-March in a </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/100000575225947/videos/1185481278770668/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Facebook video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and news release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a bittersweet time for me and my family,” Newman said in the release. “It’s bitter because I’m leaving an institution I love and the individuals in the Senate and on my staff that have worked with me to better serve Central Virginia.  But it’s a sweet time because I know I will be able to now spend more time with my family, friends, and business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newman has served in the Senate since 1996. His time included a recent stint as president pro tempore, the highest leadership position elected by the body that mostly involves presiding over the Senate when the lieutenant governor is absent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newman had been drawn into the same Lynchburg-area district as Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, who now has a clearer shot at running for the strongly Republican seat.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Ken Plum, D-Fairfax </b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plum, who with 44 years in the House of Delegates is the longest-serving member of the chamber, said Feb. 22 he was hanging up his hat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I entered politics and the House of Delegates to fulfill a lifelong dream that Virginia could do better than being a backward Southern state and could fulfill the dreams expressed by our Founding Fathers who were Virginians,” Plum wrote in </span><a href="https://patch.com/virginia/reston/honored-be-your-delegate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an announcement of his retirement on Patch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We have made significant strides, but as the current session of the General Assembly has shown we need to be vigilant and continue our efforts.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Del. Margaret Ransone, R-Westmoreland</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransone, the current chair of the House Privileges and Elections Committee, announced </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MargaretBevansRansone/posts/pfbid021wGqrp6mG36dtC9ZfZYk7RXCjSA79H8he9MUfeYSQng3XKc3Fn1Pyge7ur9MaaaDl" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">via Facebook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that she won’t seek another term representing her Northern Neck-based district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My love for community will never change,” Ransone wrote, adding that she was planning to spend more time with family after about a decade in the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransone was first elected in 2011. No other candidates had filed to run against her at the time of her announcement.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. Roxann Robinson, R-Chesterfield</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First elected to the House of Delegates to represent the Richmond-area district, Robinson has served in senior Republican positions such as chair of the House Finance Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her Feb. 24 announcement that she won’t run again was something of a surprise. Although some of her more recent election victories were tight — she defeated a challenger by less than a percentage point in both 2017 and 2019, </span><a href="https://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/articles/as-political-divisions-grow-virginia-house-candidates-push-bipartisanship/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as reported by The Chesterfield Observer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — her redrawn district had altered the landscape. Robinson had declared she intended to run last May and was poised to take on </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/updates/4241-new-candidates-5-27/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two other Republican candidates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a three-way primary. </span></p>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Sen. Jill Vogel, R-Fauquier </b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vogel announced late this January that she won’t seek another term after serving in the Senate since 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone who makes that decision and says that they are not sad is not telling the truth!!” Vogel </span><a href="https://twitter.com/JillHVogel/status/1620559216066064384?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said on Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vogel, the first woman to give birth to a child while serving as a member of the General Assembly, was the Virginia GOP’s nominee for lieutenant governor in 2017.  She lost that year to former Democratic Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, but outperformed other Republicans on the statewide ticket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent interview with </span><a href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/vogel-wont-seek-5th-term-in-state-senate/article_baaee211-aba3-5418-a9c7-29f9d18ccb51.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Winchester Star, </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vogel indicated changes to her district were a factor in her decision.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Del. William Wampler, R-Washington</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wampler, a member of a prominent Southwest Virginia political family who began serving in the House of Delegates in 2020 after a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/07/a-southwest-virginia-primary-streetfight-mirrors-republican-divisions-statewide/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vigorous primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said April 6 he doesn’t plan to run again in his strongly Republican district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While it is difficult to wrestle with the fact that our region has a declining number of representatives that will be returning to the General Assembly next term, I am confident in the leadership we have in place and in their ability to work with other leaders across the state to address our priorities,” he said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wampler had been drawn into the same district as Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other potential departures</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two primary races pitting incumbents against each other — a byproduct of redistricting — will also ensure one current senator and one current delegate won’t be a part of next year’s General Assembly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Hampton Roads region, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/2-state-senators---lucas-and-spruill---to-face-off-in-new/article_2eb23975-2d9b-5f3a-bd88-45b7ac81a0b0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Sens. Louise Lucas and Lionell Spruill are battling for the party nomination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to represent the new Senate District 18. The district, which includes parts of Chesapeake and Portsmouth, leans Democratic and has no declared Republican candidate, meaning whichever wins the primary is virtually assured election to the seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Southwest Virginia, Dels. Marie March and Wren Williams, both staunch conservatives, are fighting for control over the strongly Republican House District 47. Both candidates are also freshman legislators, and their race has drawn attention statewide because of the acrimony they have displayed toward each other, culminating in March pressing charges against Williams for </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/09/25/williams-march-virginia-shove-wytheville/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleged “shoulder slamming” at a local fundraiser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are taking our time and being very deliberate with the stock market volatility, revenues softening some and to see if the bank situation doesn’t proliferate,” Knight said in an email Wednesday, referring to possible ripple effects of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers are set to return to Richmond on April 12 to take up vetoes and legislative amendments from Gov. Glenn Youngkin. If there’s no budget to vote on by then, the next big deadline is June 30, when the state’s current budget year ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some legislators have pointed out the General Assembly technically isn’t required to pass a budget this year. Because the state is approaching the middle of its two-year budget cycle, lawmakers are modifying an existing plan, not creating an entirely new budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, there are several key priorities that won’t get funded if the two parties can’t come to an agreement over the next few months. Here are a few of them:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Tax relief</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a second year in a row, Youngkin and his Republican allies have made broad tax cuts a top priority, and Democrats have again been trying to use their negotiating power to lock in more targeted relief that would help lower-income Virginians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats have made clear Youngkin’s proposal to cut the corporate tax rate from 6% to 5% is a non-starter for them. But they’ve expressed more openness to broader forms of relief for individual taxpayers, such as raising the standard income tax deduction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Signs of strength or weakness in state revenues could be a major factor in determining how much tax relief is feasible, because Youngkin has indicated he will only pursue tax cuts the state can comfortably afford.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators have also floated the idea of doing another round of one-time tax rebates instead of making more structural tax cuts meant to be long term. As part of last year’s bipartisan budget deal, the state sent out millions of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-is-sending-out-millions-of-250-tax-rebates-heres-how-to-find-out-if-youll-get-one/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax rebate payments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worth up to $250 per person.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mental health investments </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following years of financial and staffing strain that culminated in five of Virginia’s state-run mental hospitals closing to new admissions in July 2021, Youngkin this December laid out a broad package of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/09/more-than-half-of-virginias-state-run-mental-hospitals-are-closing-to-new-admissions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$230 million in reforms to the government behavioral health system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some of the aims in the governor’s “Right Help, Right Now” proposal can be achieved by consolidating current programs, said Virginia Department of Health Chief Operating Officer Christopher Lindsay, the numerous amendments to the current budget would be a “significant contributor” to those goals, which are generally backed by both parties. Those include money for a school-based mental health pilot, the expansion of local crisis centers that provide an alternative to hospitals for people seeking help and higher Medicaid reimbursement rates for certain behavioral health providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both budgets would also increase pay for staff at the state’s community services boards, the locally based bodies that are the primary providers of behavioral health and developmental disability services in Virginia. The </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/HB1400/Introduced/FA/313/1h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls for an extra $37 million, and the </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/SB800/Introduced/FA/313/5s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an extra $50 million.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Teacher raises</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, like other states, is suffering from teacher shortages, with many policymakers pointing to low pay as one driver of the vacancies. A </span><a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/other/2019_Virginia_compared.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 report from the state’s legislative watchdog agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found Virginia ranked 33rd among the states in average salary for K-12 public teachers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/HB1400/Introduced/FA/137/5h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/SB800/Introduced/FA/137/7s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are both proposing even bigger raises for public school teachers than the existing budget provides. Under the current budget, teachers get 5% raises, while this year’s amendments would push those up to 7%. Both chambers are also recommending that $50 million in proposed teacher performance bonuses be redirected to other goals, with the House specifically putting that money toward bigger salary bumps and calling for a workgroup to set “appropriate metrics” for teacher compensation. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Help with Richmond’s massive sewer project</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both the House and the Senate are backing a request from Youngkin to put $100 million toward the city of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/02/push-to-accelerate-richmond-combined-sewer-fix-halted-in-house/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond’s ongoing struggle to fix its 19th-century combined sewer overflow system</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which routes storm runoff and sewage through the same pipes. CSO systems, which were built over a century ago in many historic East Coast cities including Richmond and Lynchburg, cause sewage overflows into waterways whenever heavy rainfall overwhelms the network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynchburg has almost completed its CSO conversion, and Alexandria’s is in full swing. But with an estimated cost of over $1.3 billion, Richmond’s project far outstrips its counterparts in both price and complexity, and the high percentage of residents living below the poverty line has limited the city’s ability to cover costs through rate increases.  </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hiring more reading and literacy specialists </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After sharp drops in reading test results during the pandemic, both chambers have proposed hiring more literacy coaches and reading specialists to help students. </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/HB1400/Introduced/FA/129/1h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/SB800/Introduced/FA/129/1s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> amendments would allocate $6.7 million to expand the state’s literacy program, which currently covers students up to grade 3, through eighth grade. Both also call for the hiring of more reading specialists, with the </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/SB800/Introduced/FA/137/2s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposing more than $27 million and the </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/HB1400/Introduced/FA/137/10h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> almost $14 million for the initiative. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Increased funding for the state’s Business Ready Sites Program</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Youngkin’s biggest spending priorities was $450 million to boost the state’s supply of economic development sites that could make the state more attractive to big employers looking for somewhere to build.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That funding became a sticking point for budget negotiators late in the regular session, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/new-virginia-budget-not-ready-for-assembly-to-adjourn-on-time/article_06f0dc7e-b3b0-11ed-8f43-9f1f625295ce.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it remains unclear how legislators will resolve their differences.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">School security grants</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both budgets call for ramped-up spending on school security. The </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/SB800/Introduced/FA/136/8s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is proposing an extra $50 million in grants for that purpose, while the House is </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/HB1400/Introduced/FA/137/12h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suggesting $12 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be diverted from the Lottery Fund for school security grants, </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/HB1400/Introduced/FA/408/4h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$8 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go toward hiring more school resource and school security officers and </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/HB1400/Introduced/FA/136/16h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go toward security renovations at two elementary schools in Newport News, including Richneck Elementary, where </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/10/richneck-elementary-school-shooting-timeline-warnings/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 6-year-old shot his teacher in January</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Statewide housing needs assessments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While their numbers differ, the House and Senate budgets both provide funding for a statewide housing needs assessment. As home prices rise faster than inflation and many areas of the state see ongoing shortages of affordable housing, the two chambers backed legislation this session to direct the Department of Housing and Community Development to conduct a comprehensive review of the state’s housing stock and needs every five years. The </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/SB800/Introduced/FA/114/2s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposes $400,000 for the effort, while the </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/amendment/2023/1/HB1400/Introduced/FA/114/2h/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proposes $500,000.</span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An inland port in Southwest Virginia</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both budgets include substantial new funding for the Virginia Port Authority to begin the process of building an inland port in Southwest Virginia’s Mount Rogers Planning District.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state currently has an inland port in the northern Shenandoah Valley, and proponents of adding a second logistics hub in Southwest Virginia say it could increase the flow of cargo and boost business development in the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House budget includes $55 million for the project. The Senate budget allocates $10 million.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Jury duty pay</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers passed a proposal this session to raise jury duty pay from $30 per day to $50 per day after initially considering compensation as high as $100 per day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin signed the bill setting the new amount at $50, but nearly $1.4 million in new funding to help the courts system cover those costs depends on the budget being approved.</span></p>

(Federal Energy Regulatory Commission construction report)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a win for Mountain Valley Pipeline, a federal court on Wednesday struck down a challenge to a 2021 decision by Virginia’s State Water Control Board and Department of Environmental Quality to grant the project a critical stream-crossing permit, concluding state officials “did not simply ‘rubber stamp’” the request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“DEQ did not simply grant MVP’s application without considering its merits,” wrote Judge Stephanie Thacker in </span><a href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/212425.P.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an opinion for the Richmond-based U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that was also backed by Chief Judge Roger Gregory and Judge James Wynn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rather, the agency held multiple public meetings where it heard directly from the public, considered nearly 8,000 public comments, addressed several recurring issues raised by the commenters, and provided a Final Fact Sheet detailing its reasons for recommending that the Board grant MVP’s application,” she continued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling was a departure from </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/03/federal-court-again-overturns-another-mountain-valley-pipeline-permit/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a string of decisions by the 4th Circuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overturning permits for the 303-mile natural gas pipeline through West Virginia and Virginia that developers have been trying to build since 2014. Four judges on the court, including Thacker, Gregory, Wynn and former judge William Traxler, have repeatedly found federal agencies conducted inadequate or flawed reviews as the basis of issuing those permits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Valley Pipeline in May 2022 </span><a href="https://www.abralliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MVP-motiion-to-4th-Circuit-for-random-panel-assignment-5-16-22.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">petitioned the court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assign different judges to its cases, arguing that in 12 petitions challenging different authorizations for the Mountain Valley and now-canceled Atlantic Coast pipelines, the judges “vacated or stayed all but two.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP’s petition was denied. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The petition the court struck down Wednesday was filed by 10 environmental groups, led by the Sierra Club, Appalachian Voices, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network and Wild Virginia after Virginia’s water board voted 3-2 in December 2021 to approve a state water protection permit for the pipeline. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Sligh, conservation director for Wild Virginia, said in a statement that the groups “respect the court’s opinion but we are disappointed that the Board’s badly flawed decision will stand.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The December 2021 permit fulfills a requirement under the federal Clean Water Act that pipelines obtain state and federal permits guaranteeing they won’t significantly degrade water quality during construction or operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ officials at the time said they expect the Mountain Valley Pipeline to temporarily impact 315 stream crossings and four acres of wetlands during construction, as well as two stream crossings and two acres of wetlands on a permanent basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mountain Valley Pipeline spokesperson Natalie Cox said in a statement that MVP was pleased with the decision, which she called “one additional step forward in completing this critical infrastructure project.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since the onset of the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) project, we have worked closely with state and federal environmental agencies to provide accurate, comprehensive information that would allow for a thorough environmental review of the project,” she wrote in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the legal victory, the project is still seeking federal approvals from the U.S. Forest Service to cross a portion of the Jefferson National Forest and from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. After numerous legal challenges and the loss of several permits, the pipeline is years behind schedule and billions over its original budget. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cox said MVP expects for the project to begin operating in late 2023.  </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Members of Virginia’s State Board of Health expressed worries Thursday about the ongoing lack of a state health commissioner after the General Assembly failed to reappoint former commissioner Dr. Colin Greene in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Several of us are very concerned about the delay in the appointment of a qualified leader,” said Board Vice Chair Wendy Klein of the Medical Society of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board member and veterinarian Jim Shuler urged the appointment of a commissioner with “a strong background as a medical physician and a strong background in public health.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title32.1/chapter1/section32.1-17/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires that the commissioner be a physician licensed to practice medicine in Virginia and certified by a recognized board overseeing a primary care specialty, as well as someone “experienced in public health duties, sanitary science and environmental health.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In written remarks sent to the board chair, Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Resources John Littel said Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration expects to complete interviews for the commissioner position by the end of the week and he is “hopeful the governor will make a decision shortly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Littel was expected to appear in person at the board’s Thursday meeting, his letter said he was unable to attend “due to a commitment to the governor.” Schedules from the governor’s office show he was slated to appear alongside Youngkin at a listening session on fentanyl held at a Bristol high school Thursday morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The health commissioner seat has been empty since Feb. 10, after </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/07/senate-democrats-boot-youngkin-health-commissioner-two-other-appointees/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats in the state Senate refused to confirm the appointment of Greene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a former Army doctor and local health district director. Greene had come under fire following a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/15/racial-disparities-health-care-youngkin/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> detailing his skepticism of the links between racism and health disparities, particularly regarding maternal health and mortality. Former state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, in a floor speech Feb. 7 said Greene’s continued leadership was “having a chilling effect” on state public health priorities identified by the Legislative Black Caucus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the absence of Greene or a replacement, Virginia Department of Health Chief Operating Officer Christopher Lindsay has been acting as the top official in the agency but is precluded from assuming the commissioner role by the state code’s requirements for the position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m there simply as the chief operating officer to continue to provide that day-to-day leadership for the agency in consultation with the secretary of health,” he told reporters Thursday. Even in the absence of a commissioner, he said, “I believe we’ve continued to thrive.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of a commissioner doesn’t prevent the State Board of Health from operating, said several members of the administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between the Virginia Department of Health, Board of Health and health and human resources secretariat, “Everything is covered,” said Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Resources Leah Mills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victoria LaCivita, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Jason Miyares, said in an email that “no board action requires approval by the commissioner.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview, Shuler, who was appointed to the board by former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, said he hopes the next state health commissioner will be “apolitical,” adding, “Health and disease, it doesn’t ask you if you’re a Democrat or a Republican.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board has “been in the dark” on the commissioner selection process, he said. And while he acknowledged the body has not previously been involved in vetting candidates for the role, he said that “anybody in their right mind in the political world should realize that input should be accepted.” </span></p>

(Ned Oliver / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><em>For updated info, see: <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/07/updated-who-might-and-who-wont-be-returning-to-the-general-assembly-next-year/" target="_blank">Updated: Who might — and who won&#8217;t — be returning to the General Assembly next year</a></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the 2023 legislative session draws to a close, a mounting number of delegates and senators are announcing this one will be their last.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-eight lawmakers have said they don&#8217;t intend to run again this fall, when every one of Virginia’s 140 General Assembly seats are up for election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the announcements were expected. A handful of older, long-term representatives like Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, are effectively retiring after years in the legislature. Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, is also saying goodbye as she <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/mcclellan-beats-benjamin-in-special-election-for-virginia-congressional-seat/" target="_blank">heads to the U.S. House of Representatives</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2023 election cycle will be the first under the new legislative maps drawn in the independent redistricting process of 2021. Because those maps gave less protection to incumbents, several lawmakers were drawn into the same district as one or more colleagues. That dynamic is partly fueling the retirement wave, as some lawmakers choose to step down rather than face a primary or compete in a dramatically different district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s who has waved farewell, and why. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saslaw, who is 83 and will have chalked up 48 years in the General Assembly at the expiration of his term, said Feb. 23 he was closing the book on a political career that began in the House of Delegates and ended up with him </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/23/richard-saslaw-virginia-senator-retire/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling the Senate Democrats for 25 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fish gotta swim. Birds gotta fly. And Saslaw’s gotta move on,” he told the chamber. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b data-stringify-type="bold">Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-Williamsburg</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Norment, who has spent three decades in the Senate and leads that chamber’s Republican caucus, told <a class="c-link" href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/norment-long-among-the-most-powerful-in-the-capitol-is-retiring/article_e887dae0-b624-11ed-b6f6-cb3a6dc236d3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/norment-long-among-the-most-powerful-in-the-capitol-is-retiring/article_e887dae0-b624-11ed-b6f6-cb3a6dc236d3.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent">The Richmond Times-Dispatch</a> that he isn’t planning on seeking reelection.</p>
<p>Norment told the paper he wanted to spend more time with family and go back to teaching, which he previously did at the College of William and Mary. Redistricting also left him in the same new district as Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Del. Eileen Filler-Corn, D-Fairfax</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filler-Corn made history in 2020 when she became the first woman elected speaker of the House of Delegates. After her party lost its majority in 2021 and she was deposed as the leader of her caucus, she’s leaving the House entirely after more than a decade of serving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I first joined the House of Delegates, I was one of only 19 women in the entire body and one of the only mothers of school-aged children,” Filler-Corn said in a statement announcing her decision not to run for the House in 2023. “Today, our caucus is the first majority woman caucus in Virginia’s history. As the first woman and Jewish Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, I proudly appointed more women and diverse individuals to leadership positions than in our entire Commonwealth’s history.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After redistricting, Filler-Corn ended up in the same Northern Virginia district as Del. Kathy Tran, D-Fairfax, who is now the only Democrat declared for the seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filler-Corn, long considered a possible candidate for statewide office, indicated she’s not quitting Virginia politics entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have made significant progress in Virginia and I will continue this work for our communities and our Commonwealth outside the confines of the House of Delegates,” Filler-Corn said. “As for my next chapter, there are many exciting options ahead and I look forward to sharing more in the coming weeks and months.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Del. Dawn Adams, D-Richmond</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams, who was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2017, said </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/dels-bagby-adams-to-seek-senate-seat-if-mcclellan-goes-to-congress/article_0ffda4aa-95ec-11ed-8f39-370c7fbe530a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in February that she doesn’t plan to run for her seat again</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in an April 1 newsletter said she also doesn’t plan to run for the new Senate District 14. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know this will come as a shock and perhaps an initial disappointment to many, but please know that I am still considering my next steps,” she wrote. “Despite this announcement, my intention to serve and my commitment to improving the commonwealth remains steadfast. There is still much work I would like to do in Richmond, and I look forward to my next chapter.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nurse practitioner, Adams has been especially active on health issues in the General Assembly. This February, she lost </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-virginia-state-government-richmond-37600759112a48b15292a0431ecc555a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a primary bid for the state Senate seat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vacated by U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan to Lamont Bagby, who was overwhelmingly elected to the position in a March general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redistricting would have pitted Adams against Dels. Jeff Bourne and Betsy Carr in a race to represent the 78th District in the House. Bourne said in February he wasn’t returning to the legislature. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b data-stringify-type="bold">Del. John Avoli, R-Staunton</b></li>
</ul>
<p>First elected in 2019, Avoli announced Feb. 25 that he won’t seek reelection in his western Virginia district.</p>
<p>In a news release, Avoli, a former member of the Staunton City Council, said he was “ready to retire after 49 years in public service.” He had previously indicated he would run again, but <a class="c-link" href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2023/02/25/avoli-announces-he-wont-seek-reelection-to-house-of-delegates/69944513007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2023/02/25/avoli-announces-he-wont-seek-reelection-to-house-of-delegates/69944513007/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">he told the Staunton News-Leader</a> he had changed his mind. The redrawn district he would have run in is safely Republican.</p>
<ul>
<li><b data-stringify-type="bold">Sen. John Bell, D-Loudoun</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Bell, who joined the Senate in 2020 after several years in the House of Delegates, is not running again in his Northern Virginia district after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.</p>
<p>In a news release, Bell said cancer treatment “will greatly impact my life going forward” while calling his prognosis “very positive.”</p>
<p>“I have a number of excellent treatment options I’m currently considering, and I’m very fortunate to have access to the world-class healthcare that is available in our area,” Bell said. “My doctors tell me that they are confident I will be able to be successfully treated and even cured. I’m thankful that my cancer has been caught so early, and I’m incredibly blessed to have a great team behind me.”</p>
<p>The district Bell would’ve run in is strongly Democratic. Shortly after Bell’s announcement, Del. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, announced he would run for the open Senate seat.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Del. Rob Bell, R-Charlottesville</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>First elected to the House in 2001, Bell announced his retirement Feb. 25, on the last day of the 2023 General Assembly. A former prosecutor, he has been one of Republicans’ leading voices on criminal justice issues, chairing the House Courts of Justice Committee and previously the Virginia State Crime Commission.</p>
<p>Bell was facing the prospect of competing in a significantly bluer district thanks to the new political map for the Charlottesville region.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Del. Jeff Bourne, D-Richmond</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bourne, who was first elected to the House in 2017, said Feb. 20 he wouldn’t run again. While he </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/bourne-will-not-seek-re-election-to-house-opening-way-for-carr/article_296436dc-b146-11ed-9a14-9758d3726805.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told The Richmond Times-Dispatch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that redistricting played “zero” role in his decision, the new maps would have pitted him against veteran Democratic Del. Betsy Carr in elections to represent the new 78th District. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a Richmond mayoral election coming up in 2024, there’s been some speculation Bourne, a former Richmond School Board member and City Hall aide, might seek the capital city’s strong mayor job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m going to enjoy some time with my family,” he said when asked about his future plans. “Then figure out what, if anything, is next.&#8221;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b data-stringify-type="bold">Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Byron <a class="c-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/kathy.byron.39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.facebook.com/kathy.byron.39" data-sk="tooltip_parent">told constituents</a> she wouldn’t seek reelection after 26 sessions on Feb. 26.</p>
<p>“Passing legislation gives you a sense of accomplishment,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “Having that legislation succeed in improving people’s lives — sometimes in big ways, other times in small ones — provides a truly humbling gratification.”</p>
<p>Byron currently chairs the House Commerce and Energy Committee and was the first woman to be elected chair of the House Republican Caucus. Under the new political maps, she would have faced Del. Wendell Walker, R-Lynchburg, to represent the district.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Del. Jeff Campbell, R-Smyth</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First elected to the House of Delegates in 2013, Campbell said April 1 he will retire from representing his Southwest Virginia district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My season has now come and gone,” </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/04/01/del-jeff-campbell-retires-legislative-aide-arnold-announces-candidacy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Campbell in a release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “When I was sworn into the House in 2014, our family photo, taken in front of the Clerk’s dais, displays a young family with children in elementary school. Ten years later, those children are grown and have gone off to college. If I have any regrets from service, it is that I wasn’t there nearly enough during their formative years.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell, a lawyer, was one of three GOP members of the House who supported </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-legislature-is-one-procedural-vote-away-from-passing-legislation-abolishing-death-penalty/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">abolition of the death penalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021. </span></p>

<li><b data-stringify-type="bold">Sen. John Cosgrove, R-Chesapeake</b></li>

<p>Saying it was time to “pass the torch” to new leaders, Cosgrove announced he’s not running for the Senate again after two decades in the General Assembly.</p>
<p>“I have two precious granddaughters that I rarely get to see, and my wonderful wife Sue has been very patient with me serving so long in public service,” Cosgrove said in his March 20 announcement. “It is time to move on and enjoy my family and the opportunities that may lie ahead for me and my family.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t immediately clear who in the GOP was lining up to try to succeed Cosgrove in the strongly Republican district. A Democrat, Myra Payne, has filed to run for the seat.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Del. Glenn Davis, R-Virginia Beach</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://twitter.com/DelGlennDavis/status/1643225961372999682" target="_blank">an April 4 announcement</a>, Davis said he wouldn’t run for reelection, describing himself as a casualty of a redistricting process that “created numerous intraparty conflicts across the commonwealth.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davis, who has been in the House since 2014 and most recently served as chair of the House Education Committee, had been drawn into the same district as House Appropriations Chair Barry Knight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While my desire would be to continue serving the citizens of Virginia Beach in the House of Delegates and leading our education agenda, there is no doubt that the City I represent, as well as the Hampton Roads Region as a whole, has benefited greatly from having the Chairman of Appropriations as its representative,” Davis wrote. “It is for this reason that I will not be running for re-election.” </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Del. James Edmunds, R-Halifax</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First elected in 2009, Edmunds, who serves as co-chair of the Virginia Legislative Sportsmen’s Caucus, said he’s not planning to seek reelection in his Southside Virginia district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was drawn into the same district as Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a farewell speech on the floor, Edmunds thanked his House colleagues for putting “humanity” above politics.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b data-stringify-type="bold">Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Edwards, who has served in the Senate since 1996, is not seeking another term after being put in a Republican-leaning district with Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke.</p>
<p>“I appreciate the many who have urged me to seek another term,” Edwards said in a news release. “I look forward to continuing my law practice and to spending time traveling and with my family.”</p>
<p>Edwards recently served as co-chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>In a statement of his own, Suetterlein praised Edwards for his 28 years in the Senate and said the two have “a shared love of the Roanoke Valley.”</p>
<ul>
<li><b data-stringify-type="bold">Del. Wendy Gooditis, D-Clarke</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Gooditis, who represents a rural part of Northern Virginia, announced March 1 that she won’t seek another term after her current district was separated into three new ones.</p>
<p>“After three hard-fought elections and six years in office, I feel I have served my time as Delegate,” she wrote in a press release that also called the new district where she resides “well-drawn” and “compact.”</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sen. Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanger announced his exit from the General Assembly April 6, bringing an end to a long legislative career that began in 1983 in the House of Delegates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Widely seen as a moderate Republican who has been willing to break with his party in the Senate to side with Democrats on issues such as Medicaid expansion, Hanger found himself in the same district as veteran colleague Sen. Mark Obenshain following redistricting, triggering a drawn-out will-he-or-won’t-he debate in Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanger decided not to run against Obenshain in the new Senate District 2 this winter. Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for Senate Republicans, confirmed April 6 that Obenshain was the only Republican candidate to file for the party&#8217;s district primary before the deadline, &#8220;making him the Republican nominee in that district.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 6, Hanger also announced he wouldn’t run in the new Senate District 3, about half of which he currently represents and where he would be facing Del. Chris Head in a primary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I struggled with this decision because lots of people statewide have encouraged me to run again because of the loss of senior leadership in Richmond that is anticipated next year,” he wrote. “I went so far as to locate a house to purchase in SD3 but ultimately for personal, political and family reasons have decided not to move away from my current community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanger signaled, however, that he isn’t retiring from politics, noting he “will remain energetically involved” until the end of his term and will keep “all other options open to continue to serve.”  </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b data-stringify-type="bold">Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Howell, the influential co-chair of the Senate Finance Committee, is retiring after more than three decades in the General Assembly.</p>
<p>“My focus has always been on education, from preschool through graduate school and on helping our neighbors in need,” Howell said in a statement first reported by journalist Brandon Jarvis. “We have made great progress yet much more must be done.”</p>
<p>In recent sessions, Howell has been Senate Democrats’ lead budget negotiator, putting her in a key role to get policy concessions from Republicans as Gov. Glenn Youngkin pushes for tax cuts.</p>
<p>The redistricting process had left Howell in the same Northern Virginia district as Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Loudoun.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Del. Kaye Kory, D-Falls Church</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 14 years in the House of Delegates, Kory announced on April 3 that she had made the “difficult decision” to retire at the end of her term. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kory, who had been </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/another-northern-virginia-delegate-announces-retirement-clears-way-for-marcus-simon-in-13th/article_6c512960-d21a-11ed-90c0-6320e83f2c34.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drawn into the same legislative district as Del. Marcus Simon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, D-Falls Church, said her husband was “facing some health challenges to which I want to devote my full attention.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am grateful to him and to my children for making our home a team environment that empowered me to pursue public office, and now I want to be there for them,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During her time in the House, Kory founded the Women’s Health Care Caucus, and she was also active on animal welfare and developmental disability issues. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sen. Lynwood Lewis, D-Accomack</b></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the Senate Democrats most imperiled by redistricting, Lewis announced he won’t run against Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach, in a significantly redder district.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis has served in the Senate since 2014, when he narrowly won a special election for the state Senate being vacated by former Gov. Ralph Northam, who at the time had just been elected lieutenant governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement announcing his decision, Lewis noted he has represented “vastly different” parts of the state in a district that extended from Norfolk to the rural Eastern Shore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In all my years of service, I always sought common ground even in times of turmoil, and I believe the opportunity to serve such a diverse district made me a better legislator and a better person,” Lewis said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis said he’s hopeful there will be “other opportunities to serve” in his future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Democrat, Victoria Luevanos, has filed to run in the district.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After 17 years in the General Assembly, McClellan departed the legislature this winter to fill the 4th Congressional District seat left vacant by the death of U.S. Rep. Donald McEachin in November. After defeating Republican pastor Leon Benjamin in a Feb. 21 election, she became the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/mcclellan-beats-benjamin-in-special-election-for-virginia-congressional-seat/" target="_blank">first Black woman to be elected to Congress from Virginia</a>.</p>
<p>A corporate attorney who has backed progressive causes like combating climate change and protecting abortion access, McClellan also ran for governor in 2021 but came in third in the Democratic primary. The candidacy ultimately went to former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who lost the race to Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Del. Mike Mullin, D-Newport News</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An influential voice on courts and criminal justice issues, Mullin isn’t running again after redistricting left him in a Republican-friendly district that would be tough for any Democrat to win.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mullin, who was first elected to the House in 2015, said he planned to spend more time with his family. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tragedy struck shortly after his announcement as Mullin announced the death of his </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/government/virginia/vp-nw-statehouse-newportnews-mullin-20230223-fqpaskq7jbhotjqtvqsksaj4ka-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3-month-old son</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, news that left some General Assembly members visibly shaken as they finished up their work for the year.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Del. Kathleen Murphy, D-Fairfax</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First elected to the House in 2015, Murphy was drawn into a Northern Virginia district with Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Arlington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really don&#8217;t know what the words should be. I’m going to miss you,” Murphy said on the House floor as she announced her decision to leave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After losing a brother to gun violence, Murphy has been one of House Democrats’ top advocates for stronger gun control laws. </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b data-stringify-type="bold">Sen. Steve Newman, R-Bedford</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Newman announced his retirement in mid-March in a <a class="c-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/100000575225947/videos/1185481278770668/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.facebook.com/100000575225947/videos/1185481278770668/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Facebook video</a> and news release.</p>
<p>“This is a bittersweet time for me and my family,” Newman said in the release. “It’s bitter because I’m leaving an institution I love and the individuals in the Senate and on my staff that have worked with me to better serve Central Virginia.  But it’s a sweet time because I know I will be able to now spend more time with my family, friends, and business.”</p>
<p>Newman has served in the Senate since 1996. His time included a recent stint as president pro tempore, the highest leadership position elected by the body that mostly involves presiding over the Senate when the lieutenant governor is absent.</p>
<p>Newman had been drawn into the same Lynchburg-area district as Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, who now has a clearer shot at running for the strongly Republican seat.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Del. Ken Plum, D-Fairfax</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plum, who with 44 years in the House of Delegates is the longest-serving member of the chamber, said Feb. 22 he was hanging up his hat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I entered politics and the House of Delegates to fulfill a lifelong dream that Virginia could do better than being a backward Southern state and could fulfill the dreams expressed by our Founding Fathers who were Virginians,” Plum wrote in </span><a href="https://patch.com/virginia/reston/honored-be-your-delegate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an announcement of his retirement on Patch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “We have made significant strides, but as the current session of the General Assembly has shown we need to be vigilant and continue our efforts.”</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Del. Margaret Ransone, R-Westmoreland</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ransone, the current chair of the House Privileges and Elections Committee, announced <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MargaretBevansRansone/posts/pfbid021wGqrp6mG36dtC9ZfZYk7RXCjSA79H8he9MUfeYSQng3XKc3Fn1Pyge7ur9MaaaDl" target="_blank">via Facebook</a></span> that she won&#8217;t seek another term representing her Northern Neck-based district.</p>
<p>&#8220;My love for community will never change,&#8221; Ransone wrote, adding that she was planning to spend more time with family after about a decade in the legislature.</p>
<p>Ransone was first elected in 2011. No other candidates had filed to run against her at the time of her announcement.</p>
<ul class="p-rich_text_list p-rich_text_list__bullet" data-stringify-type="unordered-list" data-indent="0" data-border="0">
<li data-stringify-indent="0" data-stringify-border="0"><b data-stringify-type="bold">Del. Roxann Robinson, R-Chesterfield</b></li>
</ul>
<p>First elected to the House of Delegates to represent the Richmond-area district, Robinson has served in senior Republican positions such as chair of the House Finance Committee.</p>
<p>Her Feb. 24 announcement that she won&#8217;t run again was something of a surprise. Although some of her more recent election victories were tight — she defeated a challenger by less than a percentage point in both 2017 and 2019, <a class="c-link" href="https://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/articles/as-political-divisions-grow-virginia-house-candidates-push-bipartisanship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/articles/as-political-divisions-grow-virginia-house-candidates-push-bipartisanship/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">as reported by The Chesterfield Observer</a> — her redrawn district had altered the landscape. Robinson had declared she intended to run last May and was poised to take on <a class="c-link" href="https://www.vpap.org/updates/4241-new-candidates-5-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.vpap.org/updates/4241-new-candidates-5-27/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">two other Republican candidates</a> in a three-way primary.<span class="c-message__edited_label" dir="ltr" data-sk="tooltip_parent"> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Sen. Jill Vogel, R-Fauquier</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></li>
</ul>
<p>Vogel announced late this January that she won&#8217;t seek another term after serving in the Senate since 2008.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who makes that decision and says that they are not sad is not telling the truth!!&#8221; Vogel <a href="https://twitter.com/JillHVogel/status/1620559216066064384?s=20" target="_blank">said on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Vogel, the first woman to give birth to a child while serving as a member of the General Assembly, was the Virginia GOP&#8217;s nominee for lieutenant governor in 2017.  She lost that year to former Democratic Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, but outperformed other Republicans on the statewide ticket.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.winchesterstar.com/winchester_star/vogel-wont-seek-5th-term-in-state-senate/article_baaee211-aba3-5418-a9c7-29f9d18ccb51.html" target="_blank">The Winchester Star, </a> Vogel indicated changes to her district were a factor in her decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Del. William Wampler, R-Washington</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wampler, a member of a prominent Southwest Virginia political family who began serving in the House of Delegates in 2020 after a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/06/07/a-southwest-virginia-primary-streetfight-mirrors-republican-divisions-statewide/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vigorous primary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, said April 6 he doesn’t plan to run again in his strongly Republican district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While it is difficult to wrestle with the fact that our region has a declining number of representatives that will be returning to the General Assembly next term, I am confident in the leadership we have in place and in their ability to work with other leaders across the state to address our priorities,” he said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wampler had been drawn into the same district as Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington.</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate, housing and business groups are backing a request by Wegmans for the Supreme Court of Virginia to reconsider a ruling that property owners near a massive distribution center under construction in Hanover have the right to challenge local approvals of the project in court. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If not reconsidered,” the groups wrote in an amicus brief filed with the court March 13, the decision “will have disastrous consequences for all types of development in Virginia.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-running case, Morgan v. Board of Supervisors of Hanover County, stems from the Hanover board’s 2020 decision to grant New York-based grocery chain Wegmans a special exception to build an up to 1.7 million square foot facility and approve revised conditions for the project to proceed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project garnered significant support from the state: Under former Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration, Virginia promised Wegmans $2.35 million as well as tax credits to locate the facility in Hanover. The company promised to invest $175 million in the project and said it would create 700 jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But many neighbors were outraged by the plans, and the local board’s approval of them sparked several lawsuits, including </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/12/17/hanover-naacp-asks-for-temporary-halt-to-wegmans-distribution-center-work/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one linked to environmental justice concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the siting of the facility next to the Brown Grove community founded by freedpeople after the Civil War. A second legal challenge by five adjacent landowners argued the board had violated multiple local ordinances and state laws in its May 2020 decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover Circuit Court in 2020 and 2021 found the landowners — led by Roderick Morgan, whose property lies within 1,000 feet of the Wegmans facility — had no standing to challenge the board’s vote because they couldn’t demonstrate they would suffer a “particularized harm” from the project different from what the general public might experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Supreme Court of Virginia on Feb. 2 </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/02/supreme-court-of-va-rules-hanover-residents-can-sue-over-wegmans-warehouse/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overturned that finding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and sent the case back to the local court, with Justice D. Arthur Kelsey writing the justices had “no difficulty concluding that the allegations of particularized harm made by the homeowners are fairly traceable to the Board’s 2020 decision.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans asked the court to reconsider its decision March 6, saying the ruling would “create confusion in this and future land-use litigation” by allowing any zoning amendment or special exception, “no matter how minor, to re-open decades of settled zoning decisions.” </span></p>

        </a>
        
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has argued any harms the neighbors may suffer are actually the result of a 1995 rezoning of the site and should not be linked to changes made in 2020 that greenlit the Wegmans project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-one groups are supporting Wegmans in its request, including the Better Housing Coalition, Virginia Economic Developers Association, Local Government Attorneys of Virginia, Virginia Municipal League, Virginia Association of Counties, Virginia Association of Realtors, Chesapeake Solar &amp; Storage Association and various chambers of commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This change in Virginia standing law is likely to generate years of litigation in each land-use development project, curtail development by Virginia-based companies, and cause non-Virginia companies to look elsewhere,” the groups wrote. “If not reconsidered now, the rule of Morgan will put Virginia at a competitive disadvantage compared to her neighboring States.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Buniva, attorney for the five Hanover property owners, called those arguments “extraordinary and desperate” as well as “utter nonsense” in a court filing Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he argued, Wegmans is seeking to delay review by the county court “in hope that it can complete facility construction, obtain a certificate of occupancy from the County, and commence operations prior to this case being tried on the merits.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hanover facility is expected to begin operations this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wegmans could have avoided the dilemma it caused by building on unlawfully zoned property,” Buniva wrote. “Wegmans, however, chose to proceed at its own risk while this litigation was pending. Wegmans made its bed, and now under the law, must lie in it.” </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of farms and farm acreage in Virginia remained flat in 2022 despite small overall decreases in both farms and farmland nationally, according to new data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the USDA’s </span><a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/5712m6524/bk129p580/2z10z2698/fnlo0223.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most recent Farms and Land in Farms report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the total number of farms in Virginia remained stable at 41,500 in 2022 — the same as in 2021. Farm acreage also didn’t change between 2021 and 2022, remaining at 7.7 million acres overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re holding steady,” said Tony Banks, a senior assistant director with the Virginia Farm Bureau Federation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Banks said he doesn’t believe the lack of change in 2022 reflects the reality on the ground of long-term losses in Virginia farmland. Since 2015, the Virginia Farm Bureau says Virginia farmland has dropped from 8.1 million to 7.7 million acres, with 3,200 farms lost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We certainly see farmland for sale every day riding around the state,” he said. “We face tremendous pressure from developers both for residential and commercial properties, highway construction and solar facilities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These level numbers aside, the statistical reporting may just be an anomaly for us, because we’re still losing,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Herman Ellison, the Virginia statistician for the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, said the farm and farmland estimates were based on survey data from Virginia farmers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The farmers in [Virginia] indicated no changes based on the farmers surveys,” he said in an email. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, he noted, the Virginia Farm Bureau is “in tune with the [Virginia] farmers.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks said much of the concern revolves around the loss of medium-sized farms in Virginia, or those that have roughly $500,000 to $1 million in annual revenue. Those “are disappearing more quickly than the large farms and the small farms,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia data is in line with what the USDA found for much of the Mid-Atlantic in 2022: Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania also saw no change in number of farms. West Virginia gained about 200 farms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, USDA reported the number of farms across the U.S. dropped 0.46% in 2022, from 2,012,050 to 2,002,700. Farm acreage fell 0.21%, from 8,953,000 acres to 8,934,000 acres.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if we didn’t lose any farms, any acreage, that pause or that slowdown in the rate of loss that’s being reported, that’s a welcome breather,” said Banks. “We’ll see what the numbers look like next year.” </span></p>
