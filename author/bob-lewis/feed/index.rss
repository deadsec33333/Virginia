(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, East is East, and West is West and ne’er the twain shall meet,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Till Earth and sky stand presently at God’s great Judgment Seat.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">                           —</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rudyard Kipling, “The Ballad of East and West”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When this century began a generation ago, did you imagine that you’d see a time when one political party would refer to its opposition party as “the enemies of the people?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you think you’d see someone accused of gunning down an executive on a Manhattan sidewalk by shooting him in the back celebrated as a hero on social media?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, here we are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is an interesting microcosm of a nation fast cleaving itself into hostile tribes, ideologically, culturally and — perhaps most troubling — geographically. It’s playing out before us in our politics, our policy and how we relate to one another. Or, better yet, don’t relate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither side in our widening cultural schism is willing to consider the other’s point of view. We are hardened by the echo chamber of social media and ideologically driven cable channels and podcasts to the point that losers resort to violence to keep or gain power. Those trend lines, taken to their conclusion, threaten to derail the governing structure of a freely elected republic now almost 250 years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free, democratic societies are not immune from political disagreement. Rather, they feed on it. Unlike autocracies, we quarrel openly and enact policy through debate and compromise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are democracies static. Things change; sometimes,  as is the case in Virginia,  at a glacial pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixty years ago, rural Virginia — in a time when farming, factories and coal mines still dominated the state’s economy — ruled politics. Governors and House speakers were routinely from places like the Southwest, Southside or the Valley. The state as a whole was still loyal to a Democratic Party that had championed racially segregated schools under its legally and morally bankrupt “Massive Resistance” doctrine. But Democratic control was slipping as the party morphed into today’s socially liberal party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then came the upheavals of 1968 and Richard Nixon’s “Southern Strategy” which cynically leveraged white restiveness in the former Confederate states against rights Black Americans gained with the dismantling of Jim Crow, flipping the South irretrievably from Democratic to Republican in one four-year cycle. Virginia Republicans the next year broke the stranglehold Democrats had on state government since Reconstruction by electing Linwood Holton governor. Since then, both parties have intermittently swapped power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia would vote Republican in presidential elections for 40 years until Barack Obama won the state’s 13 electoral votes in 2008. It has remained solidly Democratic in every presidential election since, including the one a few weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, we lost something. A lot, actually. And we’re poorer for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News media are diminished to the point where professional, vetted reporting is no longer how most </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/10/10/where-americans-turn-for-election-news/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters get their information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a complicated dynamic in which the financial and concomitant editorial atrophy of legacy print and broadcast journalism gets swamped by the unchecked proliferation of social media platforms, podcasts and cable stations where lies commonly go unrebutted even as verifiable fact struggles to be heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that major newspapers and the once-unchallenged networks were sacrosanct. Far from it; they were quite human. We made mistakes. (I certainly did.) We got things wrong, but the process was sufficiently transparent that errors were promptly and publicly corrected and the reporters and editors responsible were held accountable for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, conspiracy fabulists run wild, misinforming and disinforming with impunity. They blast a firehose of disinformation that would rightly be dismissed as really bad science fiction in a more rational past, yet it finds an audience among the willfully gullible. For instance, enough people believe there are machines that control the weather that</span> <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2024/12/03/florida-ileana-garcia-weather-modification-chemtrails/76728150007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation is pending in Florida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ban such a device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The past half century has seen the rise of political professionals who have made campaigns into data-driven science, turned groups of Americans against one another for political gain, knocked down</span> <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=64d6e991925efab70c3a9fc17c5590612d4d22450b9471c2429d9cfd3bf567aeJmltdHM9MTczMzg3NTIwMA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=4&amp;fclid=37df83b0-0435-6d9c-15d4-96b205326c44&amp;psq=campaign+finance+citizens+united&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJlbm5hbmNlbnRlci5vcmcvb3VyLXdvcmsvcmVzZWFyY2gtcmVwb3J0cy9jaXRpemVucy11bml0ZWQtZXhwbGFpbmVk&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative walls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intended to keep plutocrats from stealthily buying public offices and now rake in rock-star fees for practicing their dark arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no ethical bottom to today’s victory </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">über alles</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electioneering and the just-finished election makes plain. But it delivers results, so don’t expect it to go away or even lighten up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politics as it is now done fails us by exploiting and exacerbating cultural differences that a big country or commonwealth such as ours should not just tolerate but celebrate. And its practitioners are content to keep us suspicious and grudgeful of one another — the better to manipulate us every November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re losing — if we haven’t already lost — the ability to reason among ourselves because we can’t agree on established facts where such a dialogue would begin. Much of society seems untethered to standards of decency and human empathy that once made ours a civil society. </span><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/11/altoona-police-mcdonalds-threats-luigi-mangione-arrest/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been made against those involved in apprehending the</span> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-suspect-ceo-assassin-shooter-b5ff640798d799271ddd8db9f3d2a20e" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleged assassin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson at an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald’s — that shows how low we’ve sunk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the geography of the schism is easy to follow. It shows up in crimson and blue maps after every election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crescent of suburban wealth — that loops loosely from Loudoun County and the Washington, D.C., bedroom communities south along Interstate 95 through commuter country to the affluent clusters around Richmond and then southeast down the Peninsula to Hampton Roads — is largely center-left and leans toward Democrats. They’re largely college-educated, two-income households whose kids attend well-funded schools and tend to be more socially liberal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West and south of there are vast, often sparse populations in rural areas whose fortunes took a beating since the 1990s. Global trade agreements moved furniture and textile jobs offshore. Litigation against cigarette makers crippled tobacco farming and processing. Clean-air mandates, driven by climate science, undermined the coal industry that once brought decent wages to the corner of Virginia the farthest from the suburban crescent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people with their conservative beliefs feel — and not without justification — that their communities and values are being ridiculed by comfortable elites in cozy subdivisions … well, you can see how it wouldn’t take much for those hard feelings to grow and ossify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are differences that the long passage of time may or may not assuage. But the lack of communication we have here is untenable. It will eventually corrode our very ability to govern ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forget about agreeing on everything. The first step is realizing that nobody has his or her way all the time, no matter how convinced you might be that yours is the only way. We must at least </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hear</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one another again, understand what the other guys are saying and even acknowledge from time to time that they may have a point. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kipling’s paradigm about a perpetually separate east and west is not an option, certainly not in Virginia.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was an interesting revelation in a recent</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-osher-forum-nov-22-2024" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">panel discussion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the University of Richmond about the 2024 election where all of us outsiders learned – to varying levels of astonishment – that Donald Trump’s campaign had no interest in persuading undecideds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Young, captain of Trump’s campaign in Virginia and North Carolina, came right out and said it: Trump’s campaign deliberately decided not to broaden his base but, rather, to reach every single one of Trump’s voters and make sure each voted for him. It worked in North Carolina, with its 16 electoral votes, but fell short in Virginia, with 13.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would explain Trump’s actions throughout the campaign which left self-appointed observers like me scratching their heads when he made bizarre and unfounded claims such as Haitian immigrants eating pets in Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many at the time — including me — believed he had strategically blundered by doubling down on such clownish tropes that would energize his frothing loyalists but alienate persuadable independents. He was ceding the vital middle ground to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris who already had an army of soccer moms angry over the reproductive rights issue and the support of minorities indignant at Trump’s ceaseless villainizing of immigrants lacking permanent legal status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leaves him with only his base, and that wouldn’t be nearly enough to win the 270 electoral votes required to become president. Right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrong, at least on a national scale. Trump’s All-About-That-Base approach (apologies to</span><a href="https://youtu.be/7PCkvCPvDXk?si=l_2HPg2q2cP-29PF" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Meghan Trainor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) prevailed beyond what the aggregated conventional preelection polls and the national media that harped on them breathlessly would have us believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump significantly improved his Virginia showing over the 10-percentage point beatdown he took four years ago at the hands of President Joe Biden but came up about five percentage points short against </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/harris-triumphs-over-trump-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia – perhaps more synced to official Washington than any other state – has spurned Trump and his proxies every time they appeared on a statewide ballot </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">during his candidacy in 2016 and his presidency through 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This time, his base turned out but couldn’t match even an</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/change-in-votes/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">unenthused</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democratic coalition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He won 31 states and a combined 312 electoral votes – 42 more than he needed – en route to a popular vote majority that had eluded him in his two previous elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, he overwhelmingly gained vote share in localities and states he had lost to Biden, most notably seven swing states and the so-called “blue wall” of Midwestern states that were vital to Democrats’ hopes of staying in power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that happened in Virginia, too, but not to the extent necessary to flip the commonwealth red for the first time in a presidential race since 2004.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-preservation may explain some of that. Northern Virginia’s population base has a lot to say about which candidates win statewide elections, and those voters include federal government employees or employees of federal contractors or businesses reliant on trade with federal employees or contractors. When Washington catches a cold, everything north of the Rappahannock sneezes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has made no secret of his desire to slash the federal workforce. He tried it during his previous White House tenancy but was a novice at dealing with wily agency leaders and the institutional inertia of bureaucracies. This time, he’s returning to office surrounded by a platoon of proven, dutiful minions and has put Elon Musk,  arguably the planet’s wealthiest plutocrat,</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-will-lead-department-government-efficiency-2024-11-13/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in charge of the demolition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If he succeeds, it could devastate not just the economy of the Washington suburbs and exurbs but state government revenue by stalling its economic engine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Trump gained vote share in all but nine of Virginia’s 133 localities, including some Democratic-aligned D.C. suburbs like Fairfax County, the state’s largest, where he enjoyed a nearly nine percentage point rightward shift, according to the</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/2024-partisan-shift-by-locality/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Public Access Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broken down demographically, Trump made gains among Black men, Hispanic/Latino voters, voters younger than 30 and white voters in key states, according to</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/22/nx-s1-5199119/2024-election-exit-polls-demographics-black-latino-voters" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">analyses of election poll data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by NPR. Unlike ever-changing issues such as the economy, inflation, immigration and the job-approval ratings of those in power, these are trends with staying power that should send shivers up the spines of Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not to say that Virginia will become Trump country if only, for no other reason, because he’s about to serve out the second and final term that presidents are allowed under the 22nd Amendment. It’s because this state is fully capable of putting other Republicans in charge of things, notwithstanding national media pundits who consider Virginia reliably Democratic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin is living proof of that. In 2021, Virginia voters assumed Trump was forever exiled to his luxury oceanfront compound in Palm Beach, Florida, and perhaps a prison cell, and pent-up frustration over the COVID-19 pandemic and wall-to-wall Democratic rule in Virginia manifested itself in a statewide GOP sweep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, a wealthy former hedge fund executive running his first bid for electoral office, defeated a favored Democratic former governor, Terry McAuliffe. On his coattails, fellow Republican Winsome Earle-Sears became the first woman of color to win statewide election with her victory as lieutenant governor and Jason Miyares’ triumph as attorney general made him the first Hispanic American to be elected to a statewide office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh off this wrenching, worse-than-ugly presidential campaign, we’re about to kick off another gubernatorial campaign in earnest, one that seems destined to at last give Virginia its </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/25/spanberger-and-earle-sears-tied-in-first-2025-gubernatorial-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first woman governor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Earle-Sears and outgoing Democratic U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger have both announced their candidacies and are prohibitive favorites to win their respective nominations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Trump back in the White House and vowing to slash the federal workforce, it will be much harder for Earle-Sears to avoid his stain than it was for Youngkin. Democrats won’t have to labor under a deeply unpopular president, and Youngkin has maintained a</span><a href="https://washingtonpost.com/documents/7767776f-8100-4a81-a636-d323e9736f94.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_4" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">respectable job-approval rating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger and the Democrats, however, know – or by now </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know – the kind of turnout a motivated GOP can produce in the countryside and eat into the margins in the urban and suburban redoubts. They’ve got to find a way to reconnect with their base on the left while reassuring working people facing a frightening world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That opportunity is about to present itself. Whether the Democrats or Republicans make the best use of it in an election that will serve as the first barometer of the second Trump White House is the question immediately before us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a dozen months from now, we’ll know the answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s two-thirds majority of Republican-appointed justices (three by former President and current GOP nominee Donald Trump) granted a stay that Virginia’s Republican-led executive branch </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/28/virginia-asks-supreme-court-to-block-order-to-reinstate-1600-people-stripped-from-voter-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sought</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, after federal district and appellate courts temporarily </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/judge-orders-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-to-be-reinstated-gov-youngkin-to-seek-appeal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voided</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s order 90 days before the election to purge Virginia voter rolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means that the 1,600 people who failed to check the correct box on a Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles form and, in many cases, mistakenly identified themselves as noncitizens were excised from rolls of registered voters. Now, they bear the burden, if they’re lucky enough to find out about it in time, of re-registering at this late hour and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">casting provisional ballots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> subject to challenge after the polls close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has sought to position himself as a hero standing resolutely against hordes of swarthy outsiders corruptly seeking to influence American elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, Youngkin is legally and morally right in asserting noncitizens have no business voting in U.S. elections. Yet he’s never shown proof that it happens.</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Washington Post, no noncitizen has tried to vote in Virginia since he became governor. What’s more, only three people were prosecuted since January 2022 for illegal voting of any kind in Virginia, the Post reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former top state election officials say that maintaining clean, up-to-date voter rolls is work that goes on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> year-round as required under a 2006 state law — except in the three months before elections.</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically bars states from systematically purging its rolls during a “Quiet Period” 90 days ahead of a federal election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of which imparts an unmistakable partisan odor — rooted in Trump-inspired election denialism and nationwide Republican</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/election-officials-who-back-trumps-big-lie-stir-concern-swing-states-2024-10-08/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“election integrity” initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to Youngkin’s Aug. 7 order to take extraordinary, expedited steps to find and excise noncitizens during that exact 90-day pre-election period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order is much more likely to disenfranchise actual citizens for paperwork snafus than to snare a foreigner hell-bent on voting. But then, this was always about political posturing, irrespective of bad operational outcomes or adverse consequences for legitimate citizen voters like lifelong Republican Christine Rabassa of Henrico County or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rina Shaw of Chesterfield</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">County</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both U.S.-born citizens and longtime registered voters.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Clean voter rolls are essential, but Youngkin’s late, politically driven ‘purge’ deserves challenge&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/18/clean-voter-rolls-are-essential-but-youngkins-late-politically-driven-purge-deserves-challenge/embed/#?secret=I7U1rPtffM#?secret=3adjMsPkWi" data-secret="3adjMsPkWi" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rabassa said in</span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l2NI-kh1V4H3No56j1X-BhMC99LUW1aU/view" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a sworn affidavit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of litigation filed in U.S. District Court against Youngkin’s Executive Order 35 that she discovered her registration was “canceled” after she showed up for early in-person voting. She said a Henrico election supervisor “took her into a separate room” and told her she was removed for failing to check a box indicating her citizenship when she renewed her driver’s license in August and that she would have to re-register. She was turned away from the polls that day without being offered a provisional ballot and required to return another day to vote, the affidavit states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaw also had no idea that a DMV clerical error compromised her right to vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I actually wasn’t notified by Virginia. I was notified by NPR,” the unemployed computer programmer told the Mercury on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Had the public broadcaster not sought an interview with her for</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/29/nx-s1-5169204/virginia-noncitizen-voter-purge" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">its Oct. 30 story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Youngkin’s order, Shaw said, she would have found out as Rabassa had — by being turned away at the polls. She said she called the Chesterfield registrar’s office and was told her removal was “a mistake,” though there was no explanation for it. She said she was assured that she was being reinstated and found when she</span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/Lookup/status" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">checked her registration status online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wednesday that she had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this columnist, however, Shaw learned to her dismay that the Supreme Court’s Republican majority prevailed  </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/DocketFiles/html/Public/24A407.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6-3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in granting Virginia’s request for a stay, halting enforcement of lower court orders to reinstate voters in situations like hers and Rabassa’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s ridiculous,” she said, adding, “… and it was the same six votes that struck down Roe v. Wade, wasn’t it?” That decision in June 2022 ended 49 years of federal protection for abortion rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, Rina. It was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, five days and a wakeup until the nation decides whether Trump or Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris will lead the free world for the next four years, Youngkin and Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares are joining other Republican-led states in imposing restrictions that make voting harder, especially for those with the fewest resources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/briefs/alabama-secretary-of-states-office-posts-news-release-required-by-court-order/" target="_blank">Alabama’s</a> Republican secretary of state attempted a voter-removal program similar to Youngkin’s that was also struck down by a federal judge. It was unclear Wednesday whether the Supreme Court will rule similarly in Alabama’s case as it did in Virginia’s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2020 and 2024 battleground state of Georgia, a state judge struck down a rule approved Sept. 20 by the pro-Trump conservative majority of that state’s electoral board that would have required the hand count of millions of paper ballots. It’s a state Trump narrowly lost in 2020 despite his desperate, corrupt attempt to sandbag Georgia’s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, “</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trump-urges-georgia-secretary-of-state-to-find-votes/2021/01/03/aba64f5f-8c3c-490f-af34-618ccea732d7_video.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to find 11,780 votes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” the margin by which he trailed Democrat Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a bromide in politics about what motivates the two parties to vote, and there’s a lot of truth to it: “Democrats have to fall in love; Republicans just fall in line.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin recognizes that opposing Trump is lethal in today’s Trump-owned GOP where apostates are targeted for primaries and defeated. Just ask outgoing Rep. Bob Good or former Rep. Denver Riggleman, both Virginia Republicans who fell out of favor with Trump during their time in office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Youngkin was hailed nationally as the GOP’s post-Trump path forward when he won the governorship on his first bid for elective office with a genial, pragmatic, avuncular style that played well in Virginia and ended a 12-year GOP drought in statewide elections. Now, mindful of his party’s current landscape and his own lofty national ambitions, he has Super Glued his lips to Trump’s ample derriere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He fell in line.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters outside the Capitol near the end of the 2024 General Assembly session. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By now, you probably know who will get your vote for mayor, for your congressional seat, for the U.S. Senate and for president. But do you know whether you’re still an eligible voter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will you arrive at your neighborhood precinct on Nov. 5 and discover that you have been excised from the registered voter rolls weeks before election day without notice and with limited recourse?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting used to be one of the easiest and most essential privileges we exercise as Americans. As it should be. But nothing in electoral politics is as simple or easy as it used to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Americans once could take for granted now requires more vigilance and self-education by the voter and more work than ever by election officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voter ID laws in the commonwealth have swung like a pendulum over the last decade,” said Nikki Sheridan, who was a top official overseeing Virginia elections under Republican former Gov. Bob McDonnell. “Responsible administrations spent significant amounts of time and money for outreach and education about voter identification legislative changes, and citizens are saturated — with messages that swing as wildly and frequently as the law changed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fall, in the stretch run of the bitterly contested election, there’s a new wrinkle: Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 11th-hour order to have elections officials scour Virginia’s voter rolls hunting for noncitizens, an action that the U.S. Department of Justice filed a</span> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1373371/dl" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Oct. 14 to halt.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Voter purge lawsuits add to disenfranchisement allegations against Youngkin administration&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/embed/#?secret=v0ro4b4Ojr#?secret=xzMfQrPY14" data-secret="xzMfQrPY14" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The National Voter Registration Act forbids removing voters within 90 days of federal elections, a time known as the “</span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-virginia-violating-federal-laws-prohibition-systematic-efforts" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quiet Period</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Youngkin issued</span> <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 35</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commencing the process on Aug. 7, exactly 90 days before the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It marked the second time in a week the</span> <a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state was sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in federal court over Youngkin’s action. The League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights allege in</span> <a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">their Oct. 7 complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the way Virginia purges its rolls violates the federal law’s protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order, in large part, restates ongoing and uncontroversial best practices and statutory requirements for safeguarding the security of ballots and those casting them. That includes the universal use of paper ballots to provide a lasting record of a voter’s intent, a strict chain of custody of early ballots and ensuring that computerized counting machines are not linked to the internet to avoid the possibility of remote hacking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the order directs extraordinary efforts to bar noncitizens from voting, a step an ambitious Republican politico like Youngkin would take as a matter of course to stoke a favored paranoia among his party’s base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor has boasted of removing 6,303 people from Virginia’s voter rolls since he took office. On its face, that’s a good thing. Cleansing the voter rolls of noncitizens is required by a 2006 state law signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat. Evidently, the law works.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, no noncitizen has attempted to vote in Virginia since Youngkin became governor. The Post also reports that only three people have been prosecuted in the commonwealth for illegal voting of any kind from January of 2022 through July of this year. That’s hardly massive election fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enforcing laws that reserve voting in U.S. elections exclusively to U.S. citizens has been a year-round pursuit, according to Chris Piper, who was Virginia’s commissioner of elections from 2018 to 2022 and is now executive director of the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit and nonpartisan data source about state politics and government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was among the states whose election legislation required Justice Department preclearance under the</span> <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting Rights Act of 1965</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until 2013 when it was ended by a</span> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases/shelby-county-v-holder" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Supreme Court decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Congress passed the law during the Civil Rights Era to prevent state and local governments, mostly in the South, from erecting barriers to Black Americans’ right to vote. Piper said the Justice Department approved Virginia’s 2006 statute with the unwritten understanding that it would not apply during the Quiet Period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order echoes the persistent drumbeat of former President and Republican nominee Donald Trump’s pre-emptive and baseless election fraud assertions. They’re rooted in his</span> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/big-lie-trump-stolen-election-inside-creation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Lie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and subsequent legal challenges based on it that got bounced out of courthouse after courthouse —</span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/08/joe-biden/joe-biden-right-more-60-trumps-election-lawsuits-l/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">63 in all</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — following his re-election defeat four years ago. But it remains a battle cry among Trump’s deluded disciples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most vexing consequence of Youngkin’s order, which its critics call a “purge,” is that it’s much more likely to harm legitimate voters, regardless of party, through paperwork errors and bureaucratic snafus than it is to block illicit interlopers from voting. All it takes is for a bona fide citizen to fail to check the right box on a Department of Motor Vehicles form to trigger their removal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once that error is in the system, as Markus Schmidt and Charlotte Renee Woods of The</span> <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/?emci=5a2745fb-738a-ef11-8474-6045bda8aae9&amp;emdi=a352fb9f-e48a-ef11-8473-0022483029fa&amp;ceid=338091"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is no obligation by either the State Department of Elections or local elections officers to vet and validate the information before a voter’s registration is terminated. Often, a voter isn’t aware of it until she or he tries to cast a ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By then, the remedy is to re-register (which, thankfully, is possible up to Election Day) and cast a</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/in-person-voting/#provisional-ballot" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">provisional ballot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is subject to scrutiny and perhaps a challenge after the polls close, said Piper and Sheridan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond that, Sheridan noted, is the increasingly rancorous process of counting (and sometimes </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">re</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">counting) the results. What used to be a dispassionate mathematical exercise  has become snarled in partisan gamesmanship and bizarre conspiracy fantasies, a product of Trump’s toxic and unrelenting election denialism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Prince William County, for instance, a prosecution led by Virginia’s GOP-led attorney general’s office against the county registrar over alleged 2020 election improprieties disintegrated once it reached local courts and was dismissed. Yesterday, the former registrar, a professional election administrator named Michele White,</span> <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued Attorney General Jason Miyares</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others in his office in U.S. District Court alleging malicious prosecution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A major shift apparent to me is a lack of civility, often accompanied by an operating assumption that our election officials lack integrity or credibility,” said Sheridan, now a fulltime mom to 5-year-old twins and a volunteer for civic causes in Fluvanna County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Numerous recent recounts affirm that election results in Virginia are accurate and rarely change the outcome of an election. Infrequent mistakes are human, and allowances must be made. A new registrar, or a seasoned registrar adjusting to a legislative change, is neither a conspiracy participant nor the devil,” Sheridan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To illustrate her point, she contrasted two recounts in which she was involved, both in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. One, in 2008, affirmed Democrat Tom Perriello’s thin general election victory over Republican incumbent Virgil Goode. The other was this June’s vicious GOP primary battle in which Trump-supported challenger John McGuire ousted House Freedom Caucus leader Bob Good by 366 votes out of 62,802 cast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an observer in the 2008 recount, Sheridan eventually struck up a friendship with a Democrat who was part of Perriello’s team, she said. In this summer’s recount, she was the target of withering vituperation from fellow Republicans that included a cyberbullying effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is unfortunate, but I observed the process primarily to defend it mightily against those who may deny the outcome because they do not like it,” she said. “That is not how electoral democracy works.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, Virginia elections are clean, fair and secure. </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/view-your-info/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your registration status</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before you head to your polling place.

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In elections, the most important thing is who shows up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What makes things interesting in a democratically elected republic is that “who shows up” can vary wildly from election to election based on recent events plus economic and societal conditions and which party and candidates get the blame (or credit) for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s about to play out in another presidential race in Virginia, a state that in many ways is a political and demographic microcosm of the nation as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s rural areas vote overwhelmingly Republican and its major cities and suburbs, mostly in the eastern third of the state, usually back Democrats and have the population numbers to determine an election’s outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leaves us to ponder events and circumstances influencing voters in Virginia’s vastly different regions and cultures. Let’s start with recent events, which couldn’t be more bizarre.</span></p>
<p><b>In June, </b>a<span style="font-weight: 400;"> frail-looking, seemingly confused octogenarian President Joe Biden performed so poorly in a  debate with Donald Trump, the former president he defeated 3 ½ years earlier, that Americans were shocked and Democrats were panicked.</span></p>
<p><b>On July 13</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a would-be assassin’s bullet grazed Trump’s ear during a campaign rally in rural Pennsylvania. Days later, a defiant Trump basked in rapturous ovations when he appeared at the Republican National Convention with a bandaged right ear.</span></p>
<p><b>By the end of July</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with Democrats in abject despair and Biden’s poll numbers sinking, the president acquiesced to growing calls to quit the race and threw his support behind his vice president, Kamala Harris.</span></p>
<p><b>In August, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats were instantly buoyed by the switch and the Democratic National Convention imbued them with fresh optimism. Online donations soared and poll numbers rebounded as her candidacy energized previously apathetic Democratic constituencies, particularly women, minority and young voters.</span></p>
<p><b>The Sept. 10 </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">second presidential campaign debate did not go well for Trump. Harris toyed with the former president’s vanity and deftly baited him into dismaying diatribes about crowd sizes at his rallies and false </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/springfield-ohio-pet-eating-claims-haitian-migrants-04598d48" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, devouring family pets. Minutes afterward, global pop megastar Taylor Swift endorsed Harris.</span></p>
<p><b>The next day, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Springfield’s Republican</span><a href="https://www.springfieldnewssun.com/news/springfield-leaders-reject-recent-wild-haitian-rumors-focus-on-few-key-problems/B7523FC6BVGYRNQDX7LXK3NVKM/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mayor,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the city’s police chief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Ohio’s Republican Governor, Mike DeWine, felt compelled to publicly and forcefully reject the pet-eating claims and call upon Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, to renounce them. DeWine</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-vance-haitian-immigrants-springfield-ohio-threats-d74b7ff56f9a45d9389d8ebee4af1652" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered Ohio State Police</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Springfield to help with unrest and threats that have arisen from the unsubstantiated rumors.</span></p>
<p><b>A little over week ago</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a second</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/09/18/ryan-routh-trump-suspect/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">assassination attempt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against Trump was foiled after Secret Service agents spotted a rifle barrel protruding from undergrowth surrounding the Trump-owned Florida course where he was playing golf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the stuff of a Franz Kafka fever dream — strange news bulletins that stand out even in these strange times — but it all happened, leaving us to ponder what unimaginable twists await in the 42 days and a wake-up until the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those events exist atop longer-term issues, and the issue most on voters’ minds is the economy and inflation, according to poll after poll. They show that Trump holds a significant advantage on that issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris, however, has found traction by moving the visceral issue of abortion rights to the forefront in ways Biden never could. No poll ranks it as high as the economy, but it’s an exceptionally persuasive issue among women, particularly moderates in urban and suburban areas where Democrats win when turnouts are strong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K91JQDiVF7qVkjPUP3EPOt1a1cxlEDzo4euc2_0iiac/edit?gid=1733607470#gid=1733607470" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">statewide poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Washington Post and the</span><a href="https://schar.gmu.edu/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Schar School of Policy and Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at George Mason University showed Harris leading Trump among likely Virginia voters by 8 percentage points, a margin outside the survey’s margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Among women, Harris’s lead grows to 19 points.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DkYpg3JMQ0"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/new-polling-finds-harris-ahead-of-trump-by-a-comfortable-margin-in-virginia/">New polling finds Harris ahead of Trump by a comfortable margin in Virginia</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;New polling finds Harris ahead of Trump by a comfortable margin in Virginia&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/new-polling-finds-harris-ahead-of-trump-by-a-comfortable-margin-in-virginia/embed/#?secret=X4fpgmMSiF#?secret=DkYpg3JMQ0" data-secret="DkYpg3JMQ0" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Harris’ chief advantage in Virginia is Trump himself. Every time he appeared on the ballot and throughout his presidency, he was poisonous to GOP candidates in Virginia, said Mark Rozell, a political science professor and dean of the Schar School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia voters rejected him soundly twice, and when he was in the White House they rejected Republican candidates all over the commonwealth. Only when Trump was out of the White House and looked to be politically finished in 2021 did it become acceptable for many swing voters in Virginia to vote Republican again,” Rozell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump lost Virginia’s 13 electoral college votes by 5 percentage points to Hillary Clinton in 2016, when home-state U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine was her running mate, and by 10 points four years later to Biden and Harris. In between those elections, Democrat Ralph Northam routed Republican Ed Gillespie in the 2017 governor’s race and Democrats won majorities in the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates plus seven of its 11 U.S. House seats while retaining both U.S. Senate seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things changed once Trump seemed banished to Mar-a-Lago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Department of Election data from the</span><a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/144567/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 presidential race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span><a href="https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/elections/view/147466/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 gubernatorial race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows how dramatically the partisan polarity of Virginia shifted in the year after Trump left Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2020 election, Biden took 54% of the Virginia vote to Trump’s 44%. Few imagined that in 2021, behind a former investment fund executive with zero experience in elective politics, Republicans would boost their share of the vote by 6.6% while the Democrats’ share fell by 5.5% — a remarkable net partisan migration of just over 12 points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin accurately read and leveraged voter frustration with Democrats who then held all the levers of power in Virginia and the White House as the nation struggled to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. He also avoided being </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trumped</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The GOP nominating process in 2021 rejected a Trump extremist,” Rozell said, referring to former state Sen. Amanda Chase, “and Youngkin ran a middle-right campaign that kept a smart strategic distance from the former president.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, the data comparison of 2021 to the previous year is telling. Republicans won 99 of the commonwealth’s 133 localities in Youngkin’s 2021 victory, including a dozen where Democrats won in 2020. In the 34 the GOP didn’t win, Youngkin narrowed Democrats’ margins enough that a powerful rural turnout by conservatives was decisive. In 93 localities, the GOP share of the 2021 vote improved by 5% or more year over year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Rozell notes, that was then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The GOP triumphs in 2021 do not portend a competitive race in Virginia this year. The problem for the GOP in Virginia is Trump,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which brings us back to recent events and how Virginians perceive them. Traveling with alt-right conspiracy theorist</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/who-is-laura-loomer.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Laura Loomer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his campaign entourage and comments about</span><a href="https://youtu.be/V5CR7HkByC4?feature=shared" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">pet-eating immigrants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/SYRd0s6xBDY?feature=shared" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">childless cat ladies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” from those who seek control of the nation’s nuclear arsenal may rouse Trump’s base, but they dissuade unaligned moderates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump&#8217;s disastrous debate performance and close associations with far-right extremists such as Loomer just remind swing voters in Virginia why they rejected him every time in the past,” Rozell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, as William Faulkner wrote, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right on schedule, the first lady of the commonwealth, Roxane Gatling Gilmore, got out of a black Cadillac driven by the Virginia State Police unit charged with protecting Gov. Jim Gilmore and his family. Under one arm were what appeared to be books — tools of her trade as a professor of classics that she insisted on continuing after Jim’s election in 1997.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_39546" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:307px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/08/appreciation-roxane-gatling-gilmore/faminaug/" rel="attachment wp-att-39546"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-39546" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/faminaug.jpg" alt="" width="307" height="192" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/faminaug.jpg 307w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/faminaug-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Former Virginia Gov.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was watching because a Democratic operative had pitched a rumor to me a few days earlier that Roxane had decamped the governor’s residence. The tip smelled of barnyard droppings from the start and I wanted to state with firsthand certainty that it was exactly what its odor indicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just to be sure, I had also queried a few sources on the inside and was told repeatedly and unequivocally that Mrs. Gilmore was very much living at the mansion and that, by all appearances, she and the governor were happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to run this insinuation to ground because I knew another side to them from moments outside their official role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What moments,” you ask?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High school football and our sons: the Gilmores’ and mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That busy year, the governor was in the inner circle of Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush’s presidential campaign against Vice President Al Gore. That fall was also the greatest football season that Mills E. Godwin High School in Henrico County has ever had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s eldest son, Jay, was a senior on the Eagles’ 2000 team. My son, Rob, was a junior. It was a team better stocked on determination and coaching than next-level talent, but week after week, this team vanquished larger, faster football powers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had run into the governor and the first lady at a Saturday morning practice early in the preseason that coach Ron Axselle had organized especially for players’ parents in hopes they would get to know one another. Coach Ax added post-practice watermelon as an inducement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt awkward at first because the Gilmores were the state’s most powerful couple and I was a reporter tasked with keeping tabs on them. But this was outside official lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we made a deal: this would be about our kids. I’d be “just Bob,” a proud Godwin dad and fan, and they’d be “just Jim and Roxane,” proud Godwin parents and fans. With that out of the way, we were able to relax and relish those fleeting Friday nights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I figured I’d see them at maybe four or five games, thinking that they would be otherwise occupied with weighty matters of state or politics, especially for road games. I figured wrong. They attended every game right up to the nail-biter finale against Jim’s alma mater, J.R. Tucker High School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They arrived late: he had been campaigning for Bush that day and got there before halftime. Early the next morning, he would be back at it and stay that way through the final weekend of the campaign and the election on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when our sons and their teammates salvaged a last-minute victory over Tucker, the Gilmores joined in the euphoria because it marked the first time in Godwin’s history that it had ended a regular season unbeaten.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is constant tension between journalists and those they cover about how close or distant such relationships should be. It’s not like a football field: no white hash marks and boundary lines. We can argue whether by giving the first family its space, I was too lenient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim will tell you it never stopped me from reporting unflattering news about him if I had the facts to back it up. Those interactions outside our traditional roles never dulled my curiosity or skepticism — same as it would be with successive governors with whom I shared off-record moments. Such moments, I would argue, allow journalists to understand their subjects as real, three-dimensional people and are a guardrail against cynicism, a destructive default tendency to believe the worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moments like those during their time in office and since allowed me to admire Roxane Gilmore as a first lady of great intellect, character and wit. I came to appreciate her as a mom who made time for her sons, Jay and Ashton, despite impossible demands her schedule sometimes imposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I realized she loved her husband, was his staunchest supporter and his wisest advisor.</span></p>

They had two options: worse and worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Joe Biden’s Sunday concession to the ravages of advanced age (already the oldest sitting president in U.S. history, he would turn 82 just 15 days after the election) doesn’t assure the Democrats’ victory on Nov. 5. It does, however, lift the “worst” option, at least for the immediate term, and offers Virginia Democrats a glimmer of hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden labored under alarmingly poor job approval numbers before his abysmal performance in a June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, which raised profound questions about Biden’s mental fitness and sent his campaign into an unrecoverable death spiral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Biden’s polling plunged, Democrats in</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-call-biden-step-aside-tracking-updates-reactions-rcna160699" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/us/politics/biden-george-clooney-hollywood.html?smid=url-share" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollywood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wrung their hands and differed publicly over whether he should abandon the race. Making things worse, Trump seemed not only invincible but inevitable after a rifle bullet grazed his right ear during a July 13 Pennsylvania campaign rally. Days later, wearing gauze over his wound, Trump was hailed as a mythic hero at the Republican National Convention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In public polling, the separation grew wider between an ascendant Republican campaign and a Democratic one seemingly disintegrating by the day with donors threatening to close their checkbooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the seeming red wave grew into a tsunami, not only would Democrats likely lose Virginia in a presidential race for the first time in 20 years, it could threaten them in competitive contests for open U.S. House seats their party now holds,</span><a href="https://richmond.com/opinion/column/trump-assassination-attempt-virginia-republicans-wins-democrats/article_5a927c3c-42bd-11ef-a875-57a86e762128.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote Mark J. Rozell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, dean of the George Mason University Schar School of Policy and Government.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://research.wilder.vcu.edu/commonwealth-polls/poll-archives/trump-leads-biden-by-3-points-in-virginia.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll of 809 Virginia adults</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by Virginia Commonwealth University’s Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs from June 24 through July 3 found that 39% favored Trump and 36% supported Biden. The results are within the poll’s margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.8 percentage points, in a survey whose outcome is further clouded because the debate occurred on day four of the 10-day survey. Even so, it’s an outcome that didn’t comfort Democrats in a state Biden won by 10 percentage points over Trump just four years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A landslide Biden defeat that includes Virginia could even imperil the re-election of Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., against a prohibitive and little-known GOP underdog, Hung Cao, Rozell predicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe Sunday changed that trajectory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A more recent</span><a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2024/president/va/virginia_trump_vs_harris_vs_kennedy_vs_west_vs_stein-8518.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times/Siena College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 661 likely Virginia voters conducted July 9-12 found Vice President Kamala Harris (whom Biden endorsed to succeed him as the putative nominee) was the choice of 43% compared with 39% for Trump. That slight advantage is within the poll’s ±4.4 percentage point margin of sampling error. The survey was completed before the July 13 attempt on Trump’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As long as the narrative focused on Democratic disarray, Biden’s age and doubts about his ability continued, Trump and the Republicans looked unbeatable. Now the narrative changes as the Democrats have a chance to unite and put the focus back on Trump,” Rozell said in an interview Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden’s retreat is “a critical reset opportunity” for Democrats, not a guarantee for success, he noted. That’s a vital distinction, given the Democrats’ demonstrated penchant for squandering opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s see what the Democrats make of it. There is always the chance for a different kind of disarray,” Rozell said. “Imagine if there is a strongly contested convention with multiple ballots, for example, and Harris gets nudged out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An intramural power play that leapfrogs Harris would rip apart vital elements of the Democratic coalition — women and Black voters — and inflict long-lasting damage on the party as Trump never could. Harris, of Jamaican and South Asian descent and the daughter of immigrant parents, is the first woman ever elected on a national ticket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long ago, in vitro fertilization — the medical process by which human sperm and ovum are united in clinical conditions outside a woman’s body and later implanted, giving the otherwise childless a chance at having a child — would have met scant resistance in the chambers of political power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to 2024 and the looming American dystopia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, Virginia’s Democratic U.S. senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, were copatrons (along with most of the Senate’s Democratic conference) of a bill sponsored by Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Patty Murray that would establish legal protections for IVF.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill was in response to an</span><a href="https://publicportal-api.alappeals.gov/courts/68f021c4-6a44-4735-9a76-5360b2e8af13/cms/case/343d203a-b13d-463a-8176-c46e3ae4f695/docketentrydocuments/e3d95592-3cbe-4384-afa6-063d4595aa1d" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">extraordinary ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in February by Alabama’s Supreme Court that outlawed IVF. It held that embryos frozen in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of 320 degrees below zero Fahrenheit are legally no different from a newborn in its mother’s arms or a kindergartner on a school bus. Since there are more embryos on ice than a woman could reasonably carry to term, the choice becomes whether to leave them frozen permanently or, eventually, to destroy them. To IVF foes, that’s homicide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling instantly suspended IVF procedures across Alabama and produced panic and heartbreak among aspiring parents for whom it was their best, or last, shot at having offspring and had spent many thousands of dollars out of pocket toward that end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to our sister publication, The</span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/02/19/alabama-supreme-court-ruling-could-end-ivf-treatments-in-state/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama Reflector</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Justice Jay Mitchell tied his majority opinion to a state law enacted seven years after the Civil War authorizing lawsuits over the wrongful deaths of children and a</span><a href="https://www.al.com/news/2018/11/alabama-passes-anti-abortion-amendment.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 Alabama constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that requires the state to “ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitchell wrote that neither specified an exception for frozen embryos. That goes without saying for the statute, passed 106 years before the first birth from an extracorporeal conception, when electricity was in its infancy and refrigeration was decades in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greater illumination into motivations behind the decision, however, derive from a concurring opinion by Alabama’s chief justice, Tom Parker, that reads more like a sermon than a legal treatise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…[E]ven before birth, all human beings bear the image of God, and their lives cannot be destroyed without effacing his glory,” Parker wrote. “We believe that each human being, from the moment of conception, is made in the image of God, created by Him to reflect His likeness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state constitutional amendment, which conveys personhood at a somewhat uncertain instant of conception, was approved by Alabama’s conservative, largely evangelical and fundamentalist religious electorate six years ago to deter abortion. When the court applied it to IVF, however, the volume and intensity of the resulting outrage sent the Republican-ruled legislature scurrying back to Montgomery to promptly enact legislation that put IVF clinics back in operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a place for proselytizing — by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faiths — and it should be afforded all the robust protections of our First Amendment. But the First Amendment also prohibits the government from establishing a religion, a safeguard against an American theocracy enacted by founders who bore the Church of England’s yoke before winning independence from Britain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When religion — in this case, segments of Christianity — muscles its doctrines into public policy to be imposed upon those who don’t share them, the resulting conflict is uncivil and ubiquitous. It produces the sort of uncompromising, paralyzed politics that grips our nation’s tribalized culture today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polling consistently shows majorities of Americans support abortion rights in some form. A</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/25/what-the-data-says-about-abortion-in-the-us/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Pew Research Center says 62% of Americans surveyed believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A</span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/506759/broader-support-abortion-rights-continues-post-dobbs.aspx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallup survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that 69% said abortions should generally be legal in the first trimester. Support for abortions declines the longer a fetus progresses toward birth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As this near-existential election year moves toward its decisive conclusion on Nov. 5, one of the few issues that augurs in favor of Democrats is that of women&#8217;s reproductive freedom. Until recently, that was abortion, particularly after the U.S. Supreme Court’s</span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision struck down 49 years of federal protections for abortion access and made abortion a state-by-state issue. Virginia is the lone southern state that has not banned or severely curbed abortion access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It galvanized abortion rights voters, especially women, and staunched what was expected to be a crimson wave midterm congressional election for Republicans in 2022. Rather than win back a Senate majority as predicted, Democrats narrowly retained power after a late November runoff election in Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which brings us back to June’s effort in the Senate to codify IVF protections. It failed on a near party-line vote with 47 Republicans in opposition. Forty-four Democrats, two Republicans and two independents voted for it, but that’s shy of the 60 votes needed to advance bills in the Senate. But even in its demise, it served a purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no small amount of partisan theater in votes like these, particularly in high-stakes election years. The goal is to force one party to take damaging, adversarial votes that the other party can use to rally sympathetic voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the normal course of events in Congress in election years,” said Stephen Farnsworth, professor of political science and director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at</span><a href="https://cas.umw.edu/polisci/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mary Washington University</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Fredericksburg. “Legislating may be the driving factor in year one, but demonizing your opponent is the prominent factor in year two of the election cycle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both parties do this. The Republicans, when they were in the majority, forced the Democrats to take tough votes on immigration and, when Obamacare was unpopular, Republicans pushed for Obamacare votes,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine stands to be a direct beneficiary of the IVF bill’s death. He’s on this fall’s ballot seeking his third Senate term and hitting his Republican challenger, retired Navy officer Hung Cao, relentlessly on the reproductive rights issue. Cao</span><a href="https://www.fauquier.com/news/wexton-cao-clash-on-abortion-va-policies-for-transgender-students-in-first-debate/article_c835174e-4379-11ed-a0a6-bf53776c5ea8.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a U.S. House seat two years ago that life “begins at conception” and he felt compelled to protect it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Democrats can reap a residual benefit by using the outcome in a broader message about a GOP threat to women’s rights, particularly in two of the nation’s most fiercely contested U.S. House races. Incumbent Democratic Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton — both forceful advocates for reproductive rights — are leaving seats they won in 2018 in Virginia’s 7th and 10th congressional districts, respectively. Spanberger is a 2025 candidate for governor and Wexton is departing for health reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The painful reality about politics these days is that we’re talking about trench warfare,” Farnsworth said. “An unpopular vote here, an unpopular vote there may weaken a party in a swing district.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s seat is a prime example, he said. “In that Washington-area district, the greater the focus is on the Dobbs decision and IVF, the better for a Democratic candidate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women are a potent voting bloc. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pissed off</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> women are a force of nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a year when Kaine and down-ballot Democrats swim upstream against unfavorable issues such as the economy, immigration and an octogenarian president whose recent debate debacle leaves overwhelming majorities —</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-debate-should-biden-be-running-mental-abilities/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">72%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — believing he’s too old to perform, a force of nature is a comforting thing to have.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s political class loves to beat its chest over its “part-time legislature,” doing the people’s bidding in the dead of winter each year and then sending its citizen lawmakers back to their homes long before the first daffodils bloom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet here we are in the shank of June, one special session in the books and likely facing yet another legislative cattle call back to the Capitol in Richmond, this time to repair a snafu from a bungled budget amendment that restricts the eligibility for veterans’ dependents using college benefits they’ve been promised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t about mistakes. People make them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, this is about a policymaking system rooted in Virginia’s distant, bucolic past when tobacco farming, textile milling and coal mining were the pillars of an economy in the commonwealth that was puny compared to today’s. It’s about a system that invites error and inefficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve said it before and I’ll say it ‘‘’til the cows come home,” if I may borrow an aphorism almost as antiquated as those notions about the virtues of an abbreviated, amateur, pastoral General Assembly: Virginia, with the nation’s 12th largest population and its 13th largest gross domestic product, is a busy, fast-paced, technologically advanced state inextricably hardwired into the neighboring seat of national government. Its problems and the policy solutions they demand are commensurately intricate. Yet we adhere to a legislative schedule befitting the agrarian Virginia of the 19th century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten states have full time legislatures, </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/about-state-legislatures/full-and-part-time-legislatures" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the National Conference of State Legislatures. Virginia’s legislature is among 26 that the NCSL classifies as “hybrid,” somewhere between those that essentially remain at work year-round and those with limited meeting schedules ranging from a few weeks to every other year. We pay our senators $18,000 and our delegates $17,640 per year plus $210 per diem, ranking Virginia in the bottom third nationally for legislative compensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a very macho conceit that 140 people and their support staffs can, in just a couple of months, remedy the many pressing, evolving issues that require thorough research and analysis and thoughtful deliberation, instead of shoot-from-the-hip responses that seem easy but sometimes flop spectacularly when pressed into practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, any fair assessment has to conclude that the final work product is better than one might expect from such a system. In the 20 or so years I spent reporting on and analyzing the General Assembly from within, I was impressed at how well overworked committee staffs performed under the numbing stress of impossible deadlines, especially those who handled the budget.</span></p>

	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More times than I can count, I was among a handful of journalists who stayed into the wee hours with the House and Senate money committee staffs as they guided a handful of bleary-eyed lawmakers in brokering a compromise on a new state budget. After a handshake sealed the deal, those wizards of money, math, policy and technology toiled through the dark to well after sunrise to put everything into final form, printing and collating 140 fat binders known as “half sheets” and putting them neatly on the desk of each legislator on the House and Senate floors. It’s one of the most amazing feats I have ever seen a team achieve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The present dilemma arises from the whirlwind pace of time-stressed legislating paired with bipartisan misjudgment on the sensitive question of higher education benefits for families of those killed, injured, missing in action or held captive during military service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/03/youngkin-calls-for-repeal-of-new-limits-on-college-tuition-program-for-military-families/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that costs of the Virginia Military Survivors &amp; Dependents Education Program have, if plotted on a grid, spiked abruptly upward like a hockey stick over the past half-dozen years because of growing enrollment. The number of participants more than quadrupled — from 1,400 in 2019 to 6,400 last year — and commensurately bloated the state’s cost to nearly $65 million in the 2022-23 academic year, up 444% from the 2018-19 school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers voiced alarm at the rapid cost increases. A stand-alone bill that would have moderated VMSDEP was introduced in this year’s regular General Assembly session but was converted into a study resolution. After they blew past the deadline for enacting the state budget by the scheduled regular session adjournment date this year for the seventh year in a row, they went into a special session to reach a compromise on the commonwealth’s two-year, $188 billion financial blueprint through June of 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A closed-door conclave of senators and delegates slipped an amendment into their final version of the budget that imposes new VMSDEP eligibility rules. They limit benefits to undergraduate study and exclude graduate study such as medical or law school. They further restrict them to Virginia residents and compel participants to file an application for federal programs that assist with higher education costs based on income to mitigate VMSDEP expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The compromise had the imprimatur of House and Senate budget negotiators — led by Democrats but including Republicans — and Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. What it didn’t have was any heads-up </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and certainly no input </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">from</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) affected stakeholders — spouses and dependents of disabled or killed armed forces members. When the details became public days before the May 13 special floor sessions to enact the overdue budget, all hell broke loose, as it should have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The optics are dismaying. Here is the government of Virginia, home to the largest number of active-duty military per capita of any state, sneaking in cuts to a program that aids the loved ones of those who paid a profound price — including the supreme price — for defending their country. True, the costs are climbing, but these ham-handed reductions to VMSDEP in the context of a $188 billion biennial budget fail the sniff test.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did they really believe it would go unnoticed or, at worst, encounter only grudging acquiescence?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/07/farewell-and-adieu-possible-pitfalls-and-historical-context-of-pending-legislative-retirements/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lack of foresight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the loss of more than three centuries of collective legislative experience and hard-earned wisdom after a tsunami of 2023 retirements (14 delegates, six senators, including half a dozen with 20 or more years’ tenure) partly to blame?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s tough to fathom even a freshman legislator not recognizing a threat to VMSDEP as a hornet’s nest, and now that they’ve treated it like a piñata, stung policymakers want the limits rescinded. Legislative leaders agreed  Thursday to return to the Capitol on the 28 — two days before the new state fiscal year starts and the 2025-26 biennial budget takes effect — to do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, Democratic legislative leaders voiced misgivings about rushing back to Richmond to amend the newly passed budget, noting that current VMSDEP participants and new enrollees would not be affected by the change and thus remedial action could be deferred until January and the 2025 regular session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the special session that convened May 13 to belatedly pass the budget was recessed rather than adjourned, there is no need to convene a second special session — something the General Assembly has required three times since 2018 to finish its business. There have been only eight years this century that Virginia’s General Assembly has not had at least one special session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s time to drop the threadbare conceit that Virginia isn’t already being forced to make and revise policy throughout the year. Why not do it at a more deliberate, thoughtful pace instead of in fits and starts occasioned by a calendar for a time that predates indoor plumbing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve known Tim for three decades. Early on, he was a member of the Virginia Capitol Correspondents Association by virtue of his job as Richmond correspondent for Charlottesville’s NBC affiliate, WVIR-TV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he hopped the fence into Republican Party politics, serving a variety of roles with candidates and GOP organizations in Virginia and beyond. We came into each other’s orbits most closely when he was the chief spokesman for George Allen’s successful 2000 U.S. Senate campaign. We would intersect frequently in his spokesman roles with Jerry Kilgore’s attorney general office and Kilgore’s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim’s sharp mind made him one of the best at what he did when he was on his game. And by “on his game,” I mean sober. Because much of the time, he wasn’t, a fact as plain as it was tragic. He went through more high-profile political jobs in a few years than most people can hold in a lifetime and many ended badly, victims of his rapacious alcoholism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t help but like Tim. He is engaging and witty. We share an affinity for the niche film “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” and would frequently greet each other with lines from it. We bonded over a mutual love of sports, a family legacy for him. His grandfather,</span><a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/danny-murtaugh-could-talk-and-manage-like-few-others" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Danny Murtaugh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, managed the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1960s and ’70s when they won two World Series championships, and it’s a stain on the Baseball Hall of Fame that he’s still not in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, covering Virginia government for The Associated Press, I had to keep my political leanings locked in a vault and out of my copy. There were times when I agreed with Tim and others when I did not. Differences aside, I respected him and what he </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be professionally if only he could put the bottle aside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were times from 2000 to 2012 when I saw Tim alarmingly drunk. Turns out, I didn’t know the half of it. This month, he raised the curtain on his grim, long-running addiction and the resolute struggle that ultimately brought him to lasting sobriety in an</span><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Swing-Hard-in-Case-You-Hit-It/Tim-Murtaugh/9798888453247" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">unsparing autobiography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> titled “Swing Hard In Case You Hit It.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His book starkly recounts his two arrests for driving under the influence, many more for public intoxication, and days spent incarcerated because of it. He writes unflinchingly of his five stints in rehab and how, after each, he quickly put a drink in his hand. One cringes as he chronicles one firing after another and the disqualifying behavior that led to each. It’s a litany of opportunities gained and subsequently squandered. Reading those accounts is like watching a train hurtling toward a washed-out bridge over a deep gorge — awful to behold, helpless to stop, impossible to look away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book — indeed, much of the credit for the redemption of Tim Murtaugh — he attributes to his patient, loving and steadfast wife, Dena, who somehow stood beside him at his worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would be dead or in jail if it weren’t for Dena,” he said in a Zoom interview this week from the home the couple share with their two young sons near Leesburg. “That’s obvious to me, knowing the state that I was in at the time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not always something she did gladly. The destruction his drinking wrought was hard to endure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why she decided I could be saved — or was worth saving — I don’t know,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book, he said, could never have been written while he was still in alcohol’s daily grip, even to the point of having to start each day swilling Jägermeister and continue drinking through the day just to function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His moment of clarity came in May 2015 when he awoke in the Fairfax County Jail after being arrested for public intoxication from a blackout-level bender at a bar along U.S. 1 near Alexandria. The offense was a misdemeanor, but it would have violated terms of his probation from his second DUI conviction and subjected him to 80 days behind bars, something he recognized as fatal to both his career and his marriage. His attorney convinced a prosecutor that this time, Murtaugh would change for good, and the public drunkenness charge was dropped with the stern warning never to appear in court again for an alcohol-related offense or face the full wrath of the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next month marks nine years since Tim last tasted alcohol. Since then, he has held communications posts for the U.S. secretary of agriculture and as the chief spokesman for Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign, appearing frequently on national telecasts defending his boss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through it all, even when alcohol held the upper hand, Murtaugh said he was drawn to books other alcoholics had written about their battles with addiction — the success stories as well as the tragedies. Once he got sober and stayed that way, he said, the idea of writing his own memoir appealed to him as a way to help others with their journey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought that if I ever wrote a book, then I would write one of those because those books helped me a lot,” he said. “If somebody is having a hard time and they pick up my book for 10 minutes, if, in that time that they’re holding my book, they don’t pick up a drink, then it was worth writing, even if that only happens one time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dena, whom he first met when she was on the U.S. House staff of then-Rep. Thelma Drake, R-Va. whose reelection campaign he was advising, also made the wise argument that a thorough confession could inoculate him from having his past used against him in the Machiavellian world of partisan politics. The decision to proceed, he said, was surprisingly easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For years, I did regard it as deep, dark secrets that I would protect at any cost. I was deathly afraid of anybody finding out about the true depths of the trouble that I’d been in. But over time, I’d talk about it in (Alcoholics Anonymous) meetings … in rehab, at home where my wife knows all about it. It became less of a scarlet letter and more just part of my background and part of who I was,” he said. “Now, it helps a lot that I wasn’t doing those things anymore and that I could accurately talk about them as though they were things of the past because they were.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Trump grudgingly left the White House in January 2021, Murtaugh said he sought to leverage his high-visibility post serving a former president into work outside politics but found his association with Trump made him too much of a liability for major corporations. So he stuck with the field he knows and formed his own company, Line Drive Public Affairs, that advises political clients on a contract basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tim is a man more at ease now: his eyes clear, his future instead of a drink in his hands. He knows that resisting alcohol’s whispered seductions will be a day-to-day fight for the rest of his life. He appreciates what he’s gained and knows how easily he could lose it.</span></p>

(Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Posts began popping up in my social media feeds a couple of weeks ago from friends in my demographic: white, male and old enough to know better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They linked back to stories in the</span><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/education/2903154/taxpayers-dei-university-of-virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Examiner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or the</span><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/mar/5/uva-spends-20-million-year-on-dei-staff-opentheboo/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about a report by the nonprofit group OpenTheBooks.com, asserting that the University of Virginia spends about $20 million a year on diversity, equity and inclusion staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty million dollars is no small pile of cash. But let’s view it in perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If spotlighting non-essential, non-academic spending is the point, compare it to what UVA spends on its big-time sports programs.</span><a href="https://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/finances" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Data gathered by USA Today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that UVA spent about $150 million on intercollegiate athletics last year. About</span><a href="https://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/finances/234076" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$46 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of it went to pay coaches and another $22 million went to scholarships for Wahoo student-athletes. That ranks Virginia 17th nationally in athletics spending and 14th in gross revenue among college sports programs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also contrast it to the value of the land and centuries-old structures and underlying infrastructure that are the centerpiece of the campus designed and founded by Virginia’s second governor, the nation’s third president and the author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson. Good luck finding a definitive dollar-amount valuation for the Lawn, the Rotunda and the Academical Village built from 1819 to 1825, the year the university opened. University spokesman Brian Coy said he had never seen one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who built much of that priceless repository of history, architecture and higher learning? Enslaved people. Lots of them — including some owned by Jefferson — doing backbreaking, uncompensated, dawn-to-dusk labor for years on end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no mention of the human bondage that was essential to UVA’s origins in</span><a href="https://www.openthebooks.com/substack-university-of-virginia-spends-20-million-on-235-dei-employees-with-some-making-587340-per-year/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> done by OpenTheBooks. It extols Jefferson and “Jeffersonian principles” without noting that this founding father owned slaves and</span><a href="https://www.monticello.org/thomas-jefferson/jefferson-slavery/thomas-jefferson-and-sally-hemings-a-brief-account/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fathered six children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with one of them, Sally Hemings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, some personal disclosure is due. My ancestors in the 18th and early 19th centuries were also slaveholders who lived and owned farms over that time in Gloucester, Goochland and Albemarle counties — the latter along the Rivanna River abutting Jefferson’s estate. The dark and tormented history is detailed in “Jefferson’s Nephews: A Frontier Tragedy” (1976) by Boynton Merrill Jr. The passage of more than 150 years until my birth makes that inescapable fact of my heritage no less shameful to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether UVA spent $20 million on DEI salaries or just under $6 million, as the university contends, is not something I can independently ascertain. What is clear, as OpenTheBooks asserts, is that UVA has a robust DEI program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coy said that the university’s accounting found that OpenTheBooks had inflated the cost by more than three times its actual amount partly by counting each of the 235 employees it identified as full time DEI staff when, in most cases, it was only a portion of their duties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Coy said in an email, Martin Davidson — listed by OpenTheBooks as UVA’s highest-paid DEI official at $587,340 in 2023 — spends most of his time as a tenured full professor in the Darden School of Business and executive director of the Contemplative Sciences Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dr. Tracy Downs is a board-certified urologist who has a urological surgical practice and teaches in the School of Medicine as well as engaging in community and diversity work for the Health System,” Coy wrote of another faculty member identified in the report. (Spoiler alert: surgeons make good money.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coy further noted that OpenTheBooks erred by extrapolating the hourly wages paid to part-time employees into full time annual salary estimates significantly greater than their actual pay. Also, he wrote, more than 100 positions identified as faculty are actually student workers, “the majority of whom serve as tutors primarily in K-12 educational settings as part of a broadly available educational opportunity program.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenTheBooks did not seek an explanation of its findings from UVA or offer it a chance for balancing comment before the piece was published, Coy said. I contacted OpenTheBooks last week offering it a chance to comment for this column but received no reply by week’s end. The D.C. newspapers’ accounts of the study, to their credit, independently sought and included comment from the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The OpenTheBooks’ piece makes no pretense of balance. Its objective is plain from the start: setting the stage for doing at UVA what Florida and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis recently did at the University of Florida, where all its</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/04/1235725631/university-florida-cuts-dei-office" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DEI programs were dismantled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reform or abolition [of DEI at UVA] must await this summer’s anticipated changes in the school’s Board of Visitors,” says the fourth paragraph, noting Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s summer appointments to UVA’s governing body, putting a majority of his designees in control. Youngkin’s belief that his boards of visitors appointees have</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/06/thought-policing-va-s-schools-youngkin-consolidates-his-grip-on-educations-ruling-boards/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a duty to do his will</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plus his antipathy toward DEI programs — especially </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/22/youngkin-considers-budget-proposal-to-redirect-diversity-office-funds/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the ‘E’ part</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> —</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/youngkin-names-a-new-diversity-officer-for-the-state-orders-a-new-focus-for-the/article_fdbb1fdd-e6c9-581e-a7ad-b82e456843e8.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></a><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/03/05/whats-word-youngkin-takes-aim-equity/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">well</span></a><a href="https://youtu.be/gAiSKGp7GMs" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">chronicled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At least until then,” OpenTheBooks continued, “the highly compensated, generally non-teaching DEI staffers are safely embedded throughout the entire university — while costing students and taxpayers a fortune.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Define “fortune.” To me, $20 million certainly qualifies, but</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2021/11/03/virginias-new-governor-glenn-youngkin-is-one-of-the-nations-richest-politicians/?sh=33fdcf2870fd" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">our governor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might consider it penury. But, even assuming it is the correct figure, that represents 0.37% — less than four tenths of a percent — of UVA’s</span><a href="https://uvafinance.virginia.edu/budget-management/budgeting" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$5.4 billion budget</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the current fiscal year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or should we define it in more prosaic terms as the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fortune enjoyed by the white scions of Virginia’s and America’s gentry until the middle of the 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century, a time when UVA was their exclusive preserve? The flip side is the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">mis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fortune of the enslaved who labored to build and open the university but, along with generations of their descendants, were denied enrollment and the privileges that a degree from the elite public institution conveys.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there problems, inefficiencies or even abuses with DEI programs? I’ve never seen an initiative administered by the bureaucracies of government and/or academia that didn’t have at least some. Those things are reparable. Ill intent isn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If DEI programs help correct historic wrongs — particularly at institutions in the South born in part through slave labor — and facilitate a fairer, more inclusive future, then it’s a worthy expense and too long overdue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s just one old white guy’s view.</span></p>
<p><i>Editor&#8217;s note: This commentary has been corrected to reflect that while $20 million is less than four one-thousandths of the university&#8217;s overall budget, in percentage terms it is less than four tenths of a percent.</i></p>

(Bob Lewis/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia needs to keep the Breyana Stewarts who are graduating from our colleges and universities from taking their brains, their energy and their winning personalities to other states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In May, Stewart will become the first in her family’s line of descent to earn a degree when she graduates from Virginia Commonwealth University. At age 23, she’s smart, optimistic, instantly likable, and looking for a job where she can soon put her new bachelor’s degree in communications to good use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is a candidate for a permanent, fulltime, post-commencement job within Virginia. But she plans to search elsewhere, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just applied for my first communications job,” she said over a latte in a Shockoe Bottom coffee shop this week. “I think it’s a shot in the dark because I haven’t graduated yet, but I want to get the ball rolling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too many newly minted graduates from Virginia’s institutions of higher learning are finding their futures outside the commonwealth, and it’s creating a demographic brain drain that could have economic consequences. That bothers Kirk Cox.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the name sounds familiar, it’s because he was the 55th speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates from 2018 to 2020. A Republican and a career educator who represented Colonial Heights for 32 years in the House, Cox now heads the Virginia Business Higher Education Council, a nonprofit, nonpartisan coalition of leaders from the state’s business community and higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview earlier this month, Cox was blunt about challenges Virginia faces from other states that are magnets for early-career professionals and recent college grads. And he’s advancing a solution that makes sense: paid internships that build bridges to connect Virginia college students — particularly diverse students and those of limited economic backgrounds — with relevant experience in their fields of study, which can lead to jobs here after college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’ll tend to stay if they get a really good internship. If they don’t, they’re looking for other places to go,” Cox said. “The statistics show — and I think the kids will tell you —[that] if they get a meaningful internship, it’s much more likely that they get offered a job, [and] they’re much more likely to stay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “stay” part has become a problem in the past decade. During the latter 20th century though the first decade of this one, educated, upwardly mobile, young professionals flocked to Virginia for jobs in such numbers that it created uncontrolled suburban sprawl, especially in Northern Virginia. That trend is now in reverse as more of today’s smart, youthful and affluent cohort are leaving for opportunities in other states than are moving here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to track arrivals from other states </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">vis-à-vis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> departures is Internal Revenue Service year-to-year personal income tax returns. The</span><a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irs.gov%2Fpub%2Firs-soi%2F2021va.xlsx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">IRS aggregates data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the number of returns filed each year from within all 50 states and the District of Columbia and the number of individuals represented in them. Recent year-over-year comparisons do not inspire confidence for Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirty years ago, almost 15,000 more people moved into Virginia than left, according to the</span><a href="https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-migration-data" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">IRS data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for tax years 1994-95.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returns from tax years 2020-21, however, show that almost 9,300 more left Virginia than moved in. There were 243,217 departures compared to 233,924 come-heres. Twenty-seven states took more people from Virginia than migrated here from those states. Florida alone took in 10,584 more people from Virginians than came to Virginia from Florida, roughly the equivalent of Essex County.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamilton Lombard, the chief demographer for the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, said the trend has hit Northern Virginia the hardest. Hampton Roads has also lost more than it gained, he said, but not as sharply. Smaller, less urbanized areas of Virginia, by contrast, have enjoyed net gains, especially since the pandemic popularized widespread use of working virtually from home,</span><a href="https://www.coopercenter.org/research/amid-slow-population-growth-virginias-demographic-landscape-being-transformed" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooper Center research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another worrisome omen for colleges and businesses in need of their graduates is that enrollment still struggles with pandemic disruptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Student Clearinghouse Research Center data from last September shows that</span><a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/stay-informed/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">undergrad enrollment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ticked marginally upward for the first time since the start of the pandemic, but freshman enrollment dipped by 3.6%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That may be because teens see some recent college grads moving back home with their parents, working gigs as rideshare drivers, pizza deliverers and wait staff to repay college loans and seek work in their degree field. Short-term undergraduate certificate programs spiked by nearly 10% compared with a 3.6% jump in associate degrees and just under 1% for bachelor’s degrees, according to the NSCRC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of paid internships has done the nearly impossible: united Democratic and Republican policymakers. It’s no mean feat to get Senate President Pro Tem Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and her frequent nemesis, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, literally reading from the same script as they did in</span><a href="https://youtu.be/5HlKyJRH1iM?feature=shared" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">this recent promotional video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the behest of the VBHEC and its development campaign, Growth4Va, the program is poised to receive either $24 million (under the Senate version of the budget) or $29 million (in the House version) from the state through June of 2026. Some of that will help small businesses pay for interns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Some disclosure is in order here. This initiative is advised by McGuireWoods Consulting, a public policy advisory services firm where I was a senior advisor for more than five years. I did not perform work for the VBHEC.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s put aside the retail politics as well as the commercial and macroeconomic considerations. Paid internships for all Virginia students stands on its own egalitarian merit because of the way it can improve the lives of kids like Breyana Stewart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She knew she wanted to work in communications since her elementary school days in Hampton Roads, when she was an anchor of the school’s closed-circuit morning newscast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My mom always advocated for me to go to college,” Stewart said. “She was always saying how important it is to get a degree. I knew that when I started college that I would have to support myself … so I’ve always worked since I’ve gone to college.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now in her final semester, she works two jobs — one as a receptionist at a clinic and another as a promotions assistant at</span><a href="https://urban1.com/radio-one/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s Richmond stations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the big differentiator for her career path is the three months she spent last summer as an intern at the Hodges Partnership, a marketing, PR and media relations shop in Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being able to have an internship that paid me for my time was definitely necessary,” she said. Because of that, she was able to cover her rent in Richmond during that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Might she wind up where she interned? Who knows. Stewart said she loved her time at Hodges and stayed in touch with the friends and colleagues she made there. Regardless, just listing experience with such an esteemed company on her résumé gives her an edge wherever her search leads her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s time for Virginia to make paid internships accessible to any kid willing to learn and put in the work the way she did and — with a little luck — keep more of our most promising prospects home.</span></p>

The state of Ohio is one of the few states that still uses the electric chair, and it gives death row inmates a choice between death by the electric chair or by lethal injection. John W. Byrd, who will be executed on September 12, 2001, has stated that he will choose the electric chair.

It is, after all, about the most profound and irreversible thing a government can do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet this year, not three years after Virginia banned capital punishment, freshman Del. Tim Griffin, R-Bedford, submitted a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+fuh+HB394+700608" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reinstate it. Mercifully, it was doomed from the outset in the Democratic-ruled House of Delegates. With all due allowances for naïveté, political posturing or whatever Griffin’s motivation, the death penalty isn’t a light switch you flip on and off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took Virginia more than 400 years to end capital punishment. When the General Assembly finally did it in 2021, there was even miniscule Republican buy-in on</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+SV0269HB2263+HB2263" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">final</span></a><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+vot+HC1505+HB2263" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">votes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that made Virginia the only former Confederate state to dismantle death row in favor of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the most heinous offenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ours is among 23 states that have abolished the death penalty. Six others have halted executions by governors’ orders. Only five states executed people last year, and death sentences were imposed in just seven states,</span><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/dpic-reports/dpic-year-end-reports/the-death-penalty-in-2023-year-end-report" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things were once quite different. Until this century, Virginia was an enthusiastic death penalty backer and practitioner. Since Jamestown, Virginia has executed an estimated</span><a href="https://www.vadp.org/dp-info/virginias-execution-history/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">1,300</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Supreme Court halted capital punishment in the latter third of the 20th century after it found its disparate implementation unconstitutionally “cruel and unusual.” After the court reinstated it in 1976, Virginia executed 113 inmates, according to the DPIC. That ranks third behind Texas (586) and Oklahoma (123) — body counts that will soon grow.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Why did Kiki Webb have to die?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/07/why-did-kiki-webb-have-to-die/embed/#?secret=IzU7qqxNv3#?secret=JnBcjmBl69" data-secret="JnBcjmBl69" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just the suggestion that a candidate </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">might not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support killing people to prove that killing people is wrong was politically disqualifying. It was a common Republican tactic to force Democratic candidates in statewide general elections to pledge support for the death penalty, putting them at odds with many in their own base to remain viable with the broader electorate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this century, Republicans failed to notice that Virginia’s appetite for state-sanctioned killings was waning and had been for some time. Part of that is because of demographic changes, especially in the moderate, educated, affluent and fast-growing suburbs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another factor was a by-product of a hugely successful Republican initiative that George Allen brought to the governor’s office from his 1993 election landslide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the General Assembly overwhelmingly enacted Allen’s abolition of parole in 1994, it meant that an inmate sentenced to life in prison would actually spend the rest of his life </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in prison</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For jurors, that assurance eased the moral crisis they felt when deciding whether to prescribe death for a person sitting steps away from them. Assured that the convict could never walk free again, jurors increasingly eschewed death sentences and the haunting knowledge that they played a role in taking someone’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers tell the story. After the court-ordered hiatus, it took a few years for new death penalty convictions to exhaust their federal and state appeals. Executions resumed in Virginia in 1982. For the rest of that decade, eight people perished in the state’s death chamber. During the 1990s, however, the decade parole was abolished, the total soared to 58. From 2000 through 2009, the total was cut in half, to just 28. And from 2010 through 2017, the year William Morva became the last convict executed in Virginia, it dropped to eight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ’90s were also the most robust decade for executions nationally, peaking with 98 in 1999,</span><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/facts-and-research/dpic-reports/dpic-year-end-reports/the-death-penalty-in-2023-year-end-report#public-opinion" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the DPIC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Death penalty politics reached a significant political flashpoint in Virginia’s 2005 gubernatorial race between Democrat Tim Kaine, the lieutenant governor at the time and now a U.S. senator, and Republican Jerry Kilgore, who had been the state’s attorney general. In a</span><a href="https://youtu.be/o9x60sCHs5Q" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilgore campaign ad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the grieving father of a murder victim claimed that Kaine, a lawyer who had defended a death penalty client and a Roman Catholic with a faith-based objection to the death penalty, would have spared Adolf Hitler from execution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ad was widely panned as a gratuitous, tone-deaf overreach, and it boomeranged on Kilgore’s campaign as it was already imploding. Kaine quickly aired</span><a href="https://youtu.be/Ec5o6qOoKdY?si=1Uck1qTSw0Wabz5S" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a rebuttal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which he spoke directly into the camera and said that he would “carry out death sentences imposed by Virginia juries because that’s the law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And he did — 11 times from the day he took office in January 2006 through the end of his term four years later. The last to be executed under Kaine’s watch was</span><a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=0f55834a5ebf2957JmltdHM9MTcwNjY1OTIwMCZpZ3VpZD0wYTcxMmYwZi03NzdjLTY5YzItMzYxOS0zYzhjNzZjYjY4MDgmaW5zaWQ9NTU1NQ&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=0a712f0f-777c-69c2-3619-3c8c76cb6808&amp;psq=death+penalty+from+the+d.c.+snipers+2002&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGlzdG9yeS5jb20vdGhpcy1kYXktaW4taGlzdG9yeS93YXNoaW5ndG9uLWQtYy1zbmlwZXItam9obi1tdWhhbW1hZC1jb252aWN0ZWQjOn46dGV4dD1Kb2huJTIwTXVoYW1tYWQlMjB3YXMlMjBzZW50ZW5jZWQlMjB0byUyMGRlYXRoJTIwb24lMjBNYXJjaCxsaWZlJTIwaW4lMjBwcmlzb24lMjB3aXRob3V0JTIwdGhlJTIwcG9zc2liaWxpdHklMjBvZiUyMHBhcm9sZS4&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">John Allan Muhammad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, convicted as one of the two snipers who terrorized Virginia, the District of Columbia and Maryland in 2002, shooting 10 people dead and injuring three.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital punishment is an emotional issue that almost evenly divides the nation. A</span><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/poll-for-the-first-time-more-americans-believe-the-death-penalty-is-applied-unfairly-in-the-united-states" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Gallup poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that 50% of those surveyed said they felt the death penalty is unfairly applied compared to 47% who felt it was fairly applied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the obvious: Very few people of means go to death row. It’s a different story if you’re Black or poor. Of the</span><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/states-landing" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">113 executed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia inmates, 52 of them — 46% — were Black, a ratio more than double the state’s Black population of 20%. For defendants who can’t afford skilled, experienced death-penalty litigators, the odds are even worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is our criminal justice system so infallible that it should green-light actions as irrevocable as taking another person’s life? Hardly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the DPIC, 196 people sentenced to death nationally since 1973 have been exonerated, including Virginia’s</span><a href="https://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3721" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Earl Washington</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Jr., who was poor </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Black. Washington, with an IQ of 69, spent 16 years incarcerated — nine on death row, once within days of being executed — because of false and misleading forensic evidence, woeful trial counsel and his own coerced confession. Gov. Doug Wilder commuted his sentence to life imprisonment in 1993. Gov. Jim Gilmore pardoned Washington in 2000 after DNA testing, not available at the time of his trial in 1984, exonerated him from the murder and rape for which he was convicted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Griffin’s misbegotten bid to restore capital punishment foundered just before an Alabama execution underscored misgivings Americans increasingly harbor about terminal punishment more suited to despotic regimes.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zaAj9R78Do"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/01/04/virginia-abolished-biased-inefficient-botched-executions-more-states-should-follow-suit/">Virginia abolished biased, inefficient, botched executions; more states should follow suit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia abolished biased, inefficient, botched executions; more states should follow suit&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/01/04/virginia-abolished-biased-inefficient-botched-executions-more-states-should-follow-suit/embed/#?secret=MajVGmPSn3#?secret=zaAj9R78Do" data-secret="zaAj9R78Do" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many states unable to procure the drugs necessary to execute people by lethal injection, Alabama tested a novel way to kill: subjecting the condemned – strapped to a gurney – to pure nitrogen, depriving him of oxygen. Alabama’s attorney general called it “a textbook execution,” promised further hypoxia executions in Alabama and offered to tutor other states in its use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Associated Press writer Kim Chandler, a witness to the execution, described something much more unnerving. For about two minutes, according to</span><a href="https://d.docs.live.net/2812febced1923cf/Documents/Custom%20Office%20Templates/shake%20and%20writhe%20violently,%20in%20thrashing%20spasms%20and%20seizure-like%20movements,%20at%20about%207:58%20p.m.%20The%20force%20of%20his%20movements%20caused%20the%20gurney%20to%20visibly%20move%20at%20least%20once." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">AP’s first-person account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, condemned murderer Kenneth Eugene Smith shook and writhed violently, “in thrashing spasms and seizure-like movements,” the force of which “caused the gurney to visibly move at least once.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no way to inflict death on a confined, terrified human being that doesn’t horrify an ordinary person. That’s because no matter the method — an intravenous drip of lethal drugs, electrical voltage, a noose, a firing squad or nitrogen gas — the end result is a fresh corpse. Each is just as final, its victims just as eternally dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If those methods knot your stomach, then maybe our conversations should be about whether governments should execute people, not how.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all the documents school officials might claim that the public had no right to see, RPS’s leaders picked one that explained how school and district personnel at varied levels made disastrous judgments and failed to share potentially lifesaving information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated crowd of more than 3,000 people, awash in the joyful afterglow of seeing loved ones get their diplomas, was departing the theater when gunfire shattered the balmy, early evening tranquility. Shawn Jackson, 18, and Renzo Jackson, 36, lay fatally shot outside the theater. Screaming and terrified, people stampeded into adjacent Monroe Park and  Virginia Commonwealth University’s campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mass shooting topped newscasts nationally. Even in Richmond, a city where gun violence is so commonplace that it leads local news broadcasts almost nightly, it shocked the conscience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During calendar years 2022 and 2023, a total of 27 mass shootings in Virginia left 43 people dead and 101 injured, according to the nonprofit, independent</span><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun Violence Archive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The GVA defines a mass shooting as an incident in which at least four victims are either killed or injured by gunfire, excluding the shooter. Thirteen suspects have been arrested in those attacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond and Norfolk tied for the most mass shootings in Virginia during those two years at five incidents apiece. In Norfolk, eight people died in mass shootings and 17 were injured, while six died and 20 were injured in Richmond.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guns take a particularly dreadful toll on teens who reflexively use them to settle scores, as allegedly happened at the HHS graduation. In 2023, individual shootings ended the lives of 34 Virginians between the ages of 12 and 17, according to</span><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">GVA data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Again, the commonwealth’s capital was tied for the most alongside Norfolk and Newport News with four individual teen gun deaths each last year. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reporters at WTVR-TV (CBS6) and the Richmond Times-Dispatch, joined by government transparency advocate Joshua Stanfield, filed requests for the report under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, they were denied. The stated reason was attorney-client privilege, which shields discussions between lawyers and their clients on specific legal matters. After RPS’s refusal was challenged Jan. 12 in Richmond Circuit Court, Judge Reilly Marchant swatted the school district’s specious argument aside in his</span><a href="https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/89/c8/02d0fe2c4142b421b67057c05e90/letter-opinion-and-order-cl23-5464-cl23-5374.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jan. 16 order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the 32-page document — with a few sentences he felt contained potentially privileged information redacted — be released by the next day.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZARcylwIBj"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/16/judge-orders-release-of-richmond-graduation-shooting-report-with-limited-redactions/">Judge orders release of Richmond graduation shooting report with limited redactions</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporter Tyler Layne of WTVR said he repeatedly tried to convince a clerk for the school board that the board should reconsider its decision to deny his FOIA request. That went nowhere, so he sued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason we took the school board to court is because we believe the public deserves to know. That’s behind everything I do,” he said in an interview Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When</span><a href="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/8d/98d53356-b567-11ee-aa50-1bc3b68a7b04/65a81ea086fcd.pdf.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was released, it was immediately clear why the district tried to bury it. The slain student had some very dangerous enemies at school who were unambiguous about their malignant intentions toward him. It was so serious that Shawn Jackson was designated as a homebound student, a step taken to distance him from those who wanted him dead. In page after page, the report shows in dismaying detail how Jackson’s mother’s clear, numerous and even desperate warnings to school staff and administrators failed to initiate protective actions by the district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the more alarming portions of the report is an email chronology that begins in June 2022 with the slain student’s mother, Tameeka Smith, telling an HHS counselor, the school principal at the time and RPS Superintendent Jason Kamras that her family’s home had been “shot up” by her son’s enemies from Huguenot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last January, she emailed the counselor asking if her son could be isolated when he took a test at HHS, reminding school officials that her son was homebound because of “ongoing mental health issues as well as the threat of neighborhood violence stemming from his association with another student that was involved in a crime.” Two days later, when she learned to her horror that her son wasn’t isolated, she emailed the counselor again, writing: “He was in the class with people who literally tried to kill him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That should have set off loud alarm sirens. Some school personnel knew of the danger Shawn Jackson faced from his  adversaries, the report said. Yet somehow — in breach of the district’s own written threat assessment protocols — the homebound student was allowed to participate in the commencement ceremony without the required authorization of the principal at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these damning details would have remained unknown to the public, but for local journalists’ uncommon and brave decision to force the issue to court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Megan Rhyne, the executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, said that governmental entities, emboldened by the continuing financial enfeeblement of news organizations, are more willing to thumb their noses at FOIA requests, even when there is an obvious duty to inform the public. Even in cases as egregious as the RPS matter, journalists have to weigh the requisite investment of money and time necessary to take the matter to court.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Virginia, like RPS, is citing attorney-client privilege to withhold a report into the point-blank shooting deaths of three of the school’s football players aboard a bus returning from a Washington, D.C., field trip in November 2022. That was also national front-page news that shocked the world of intercollegiate sports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As the newspaper industry started shrinking — not just Virginia but all over — the number of cases being brought by media outlets to enforce public records and public meetings laws has shrunk drastically with it,” Rhyne said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she said she has seen an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the number of individual journalists and ordinary people who consider public information to be indeed public, who are suing in General District courts to access information to which state law says they’re entitled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Layne, who has been actively on the beat reporting on-camera at CBS6 for barely two years, is like a terrier when he sinks his teeth into a public accountability story. He knows how to use FOIA laws and is unafraid to escalate a matter to court if he feels the government is wrongly denying access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, when the City of Richmond denied his FOIA request for documents about a tree known to be decayed and dangerous that later fell on a city worker in a city park and killed him, he sued in Richmond General District Court. The city released the information a day before the case was to be tried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Layne may have fewer fellow journalists guarding the ramparts with him these days, but he’s not alone in asserting rights available to every citizen to pry the lid of secrecy off government information and expose the rot public officials try to conceal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s as it should be. Freedom of information isn’t just for journalism. It’s for you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin and billionaire Ted Leonsis earlier this month</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/12/13/virginia-announces-plan-to-bring-two-pro-sports-teams-to-alexandria/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announced a nonbinding handshake deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to move two sibling franchises — the National Hockey League’s Washington Capitals and the National Basketball Association’s Washington Wizards — from downtown D.C. to Alexandria.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a deal reportedly valued at $2.2 billion, Virginia and local governments would contribute about $1.35 billion in bonded debt if the project, envisioned for completion in 2028, comes to fruition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leonsis is managing partner of Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment, the teams’ ownership group, which would put up $403 million to kick-start construction of a sports-entertainment complex replete with a concert venue, hotels, apartments, offices and parking on 12 acres in Potomac Yards in northern Alexandria near the Potomac River and Reagan National Airport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/12/15/capitals-wizards-potomac-yard-arena-finances-virginia-dc/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dec. 15 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Washington Post, it would constitute the largest public subsidy ever for an arena project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, in an interview with the Post, spun it as a “pretty darn unique” arrangement. The Post quoted him as saying that two bonds, issued by a legislatively created sports and entertainment authority, would be defrayed mostly by revenue to be collected within the footprint of the project. It would be, he said, “the quintessential public-private partnership” that uses revenues that otherwise would not exist to support the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the Caps and Wizards move, it would leave baseball’s Washington Nationals as the lone major sports franchise that plays its games in the district. Washington’s woebegone pro football franchise, presently known as the Commanders, has tried for years to ditch the cavernous, exurban and impersonal confines of 26-year-old FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, for a nicer, perhaps more welcoming venue. The team’s efforts have included</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/21/why-sen-chap-petersen-is-right-va-shouldnt-build-dan-snyder-a-stadium/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">several failed flirtations with Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The stadium is about 35 miles from the football team’s training facility and headquarters in Loudoun County, Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I enjoy sports as much as the next dude. I can — and do, just ask my wife! — squander long hours on autumn Saturdays watching fast, hulking college kids collide with devastating force, all in furtherance of the amateur scholar-athlete ideal. (Full disclosure: I benefited from it myself many years ago on a football scholarship at Ole Miss.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet I have never been comfortable with the notion of obligating public money to build lavish sports/entertainment playpens for billionaire owners of privately held teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fans are passionate about their teams, but it’s strictly business to the plutocratic owners who aren’t the least bit bashful about threatening to move a team across the country (or across the Potomac River) unless the incumbent city coughs up hundreds of millions of dollars in tax-backed money for better arenas and other goodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capital One Center opened 26 years ago, which puts it among pro basketball’s older venues. It’s positively youthful, however, compared with the legendary likes of Madison Square Garden, home to the New York Knicks, now 55 years old. Last week, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser offered half a billion dollars in improvements to Capital One Center as the city’s </span><a href="https://dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-dc-council-introduce-legislation-support-downtown-revitalization-investment" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“best and final offer”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the teams to stay put.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assuming the Virginia deal goes through, who’s to say that two or three decades down the line, the commonwealth and Alexandria might not find themselves in the same straits Bowser and D.C. are in now, when the teams deliver a familiar ultimatum: “pay up or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">adios</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

		<p style="font-size:13px"><b>– Author and former chief of staff to Govs. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine</b></p>
	</div>
	</div>

	</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Leighty had been a linchpin in more state transactions than even he can enumerate during decades of state government service in widely varying, high-level roles before he became chief of staff to Govs. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine during the first decade of the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century. Much of it is chronicled in his memoir, “</span><a href="https://www.thevirginiashop.org/product/capitol-secrets-leadership-wisdom-from-a-lifetime-of-public-service/1898" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitol Secrets: Leadership Wisdom from a Lifetime of Public Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” published earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He&#8217;s skeptical of the Youngkin-Leonsis deal for practical and political reasons. For instance, who is liable for overruns in the event that the project’s costs exceed their funded expectations – or if the project fails?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There isn’t a strong secondary market for ice rinks and indoor basketball venues,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens if the teams decamp before the bonds are paid off? That happened in St. Louis in 2015 when the NFL’s Rams left that city’s domed stadium and returned to Los Angeles, the city they had departed for St. Louis 21 years earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project faces politically driven scrutiny in an uncertain sojourn through the General Assembly, which would have to create the special sports and entertainment taxing authority the plan envisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But perhaps more perilous, Leighty notes, are the local politics of Alexandria, where the project would be subject to local zoning battles unless it is built entirely by a state government entity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s zeal to get in front of the Caps/Wizards deal landed his administration squarely in the midst of a regional budget dispute, Leighty noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He’s not the first governor to get too far over his skis in advancing a Northern Virginia arena project. Gov. Douglas Wilder, in 1992,</span><a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/gov-wilder-redskins-owner-disclose-plans-to-build-football-stadium-in-a-virginia-city" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announced a deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a new Washington Redskins stadium — in Potomac Yards, no less! — before it wound up in Landover.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I spent enough time trying to navigate building state facilities in NoVa [Northern Virginia] to know that you can’t succeed unless it was their idea,” Leighty added. “Just how long do rookie governors get to make rookie mistakes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pro sports teams are not huge economic drivers. A</span><a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2017-05-01/the-economics-of-subsidizing-sports-stadiums/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed that economists overwhelmingly disapproved of public subsidies for sports venues as a way to foster growth within communities. One economist in the study, Michael Leeds, wrote that if all of Chicago’s vaunted pro franchises — baseball’s Cubs and White Sox, hockey’s Blackhawks, the Bulls in basketball and football’s Bears — disappeared, the dent to Chicago’s economy would be a fraction of one percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big league sports are an emotional investment. They’re undeniably a rallying point — even an essential part of the identity — of a city or region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who would know </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">anything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about, much less visit, Green Bay, Wisconsin, in the winter if not for the Packers? And who can forget the night baseball resumed in Yankee Stadium after the incalculable trauma New York suffered on 9/11? There were goosebumps, lumps in throats and teary eyes from sea to shining sea as President George W. Bush — bulked up with concealed bulletproofing — delivered the ceremonial first pitch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, a scholarship Rice University </span><a href="https://world-wire.com/glenn-youngkin-basketball/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">basketball player</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, understands the pull of sports. He knows that Virginia has been on the outside looking in except for about a half-dozen seasons in the 1970s when the Virginia Squires of the short-lived American Basketball Association rotated home games in Norfolk, Richmond and Roanoke before folding in 1976. His intention is well placed and sincere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not that Virginia can’t have nice things. It’s a question of who pays for them and who owns what after it’s all done.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s understandable that a former hedge fund executive who had never held elective office just a few years ago might enter office demanding that his word shall be dictum over all he surveys, especially those whom he appoints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw it just hours after Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 2022 inauguration when he signed executive directives, some of them seeking to dictate things governors can’t actually dictate. Freshman governors have steep learning curves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That seems especially true when it comes to education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin made it a resonant issue of his victorious 2021 election campaign. No sooner had his inaugural parade ended than he issued an executive order commanding an end to pandemic-era requirements that school kids wear masks in classes. A few weeks later, a</span><a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=4bea02e76c0cd764JmltdHM9MTcwMTczNDQwMCZpZ3VpZD0wYTcxMmYwZi03NzdjLTY5YzItMzYxOS0zYzhjNzZjYjY4MDgmaW5zaWQ9NTE5OA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=0a712f0f-777c-69c2-3619-3c8c76cb6808&amp;psq=youngkin+masking+executive+order+court&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2FzaGluZ3RvbnBvc3QuY29tL2VkdWNhdGlvbi8yMDIyLzAyLzA0L2FybGluZ3Rvbi1qdWRnZS1pc3N1ZXMtdGVtcG9yYXJ5LXJlc3RyYWluaW5nLW9yZGVyLWJhcnJpbmctZW5mb3JjZW1lbnQteW91bmdraW5zLW1hc2stb3B0aW9uYWwtcG9saWN5Lw&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">judge ruled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that those decisions belong to individual local school boards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In no time, his appointees had</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/15/after-nominee-standoff-youngkin-is-poised-to-appoint-a-majority-on-the-virginia-board-of-education/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">gained control</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Virginia Board of Education and began to push new </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/07/18/virginia-transgender-student-model-policies-youngkin/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">model policy guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that peeled away new protections for transgender students. When a handful of districts balked,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/08/29/virginia-schools-transgender-policies-youngkin/?itid=sr_21" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin pushed back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and his fellow Republican, Attorney General Jason Miyares, swiftly issued a</span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/files/Opinions/2023/23-042-Youngkin-issued.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">supportive opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating the districts must adopt policies “consistent with” the state’s guidance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor seeks curriculum reforms that proscribe the teaching of “</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/education-richmond-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-virginia-8ad5da65b9cb05265f2b8081c41827cd#:~:text=Youngkin%E2%80%99s%20Executive%20Order%201%20defines%20critical%20race%20theory,limited%20approach%20than%20actions%20other%20states%20have%20adopted." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inherently divisive concepts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” His appointees,</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2022/11/18/youngkin-history-virginia-standards" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">aided by</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conservative think tanks, embarked on a widely panned</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/11/16/virginia-school-history-standards-youngkin/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzAxNTc5NjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzAyOTYxOTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3MDE1Nzk2MDAsImp0aSI6IjE3ZTcwOWZiLWNlMWQtNGE3Yy1hODM5LWRkNGQ5MmIyNzM2NyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjAyMi8xMS8xNi92aXJnaW5pYS1zY2hvb2wtaGlzdG9yeS1zdGFuZGFyZHMteW91bmdraW4vIn0.pIMOzAJ7zugwf-LyF0pL7P2thrWmXycIgwDE57bN8XQ" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">writethrough of history standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that downplayed discomfiting things about slavery and trespasses too numerous to inventory against indigenous people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it seems the governor is not content just to throw his weight around in K-12 education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an eye toward what many Republicans point to as liberal indoctrination on state-supported college campuses and boards of visitors not doing enough to counter it, Youngkin asked Miyares for another opinion. The question: whether, under state law, those boards have a primary duty “to serve the university or college only, or the Commonwealth [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">] more broadly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ one-sentence response in his</span><a href="http://www.oag.state.va.us/files/opinions/2023/23-052-youngkin-issued.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Oct. 2 opinion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is unequivocal: the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is evident that a board of visitors simply serves as the vehicle by which the General Assembly has chosen to exercise the Commonwealth’s control over its colleges and universities,” the opinion states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And by “the Commonwealth,” the governor means himself — he to whom the appointment is owed. He said as much in a speech to public college and university board members at an orientation session last month. The following is from a</span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XBaFLSjKlQIB-KmEYuLHgzBf4w_4T9V-/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">transcript</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Youngkin’s comments that the publication</span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/government/state-policy/2023/11/30/virginia-ags-opinion-higher-ed-raises-questions" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Higher Ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request:</span></p>

    <div class="indent2Container">
        <span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This myth that board members are cheerleaders for the university and cheerleaders for the President and take things as written and smiles and approves them. That is not the way it works. You have a responsibility to the Commonwealth of Virginia. And the structure is really straightforward, that … </span><b>I as governor appoints </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">[</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">]</span><b> you to play that role as a responsible extension of the executive branch</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And in that role, yes, you have, you have (a) huge responsibility to the institution. But first and foremost, to the Commonwealth.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">” <em>(Emphasis added)</em></span>    </div>

	
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am unqualified to debate the legal reasoning of our learned attorney general. I will leave that to lawyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a layman’s point of view, common sense implies that boards of visitors members hold a duty to the commonwealth, its laws and Constitution. The colleges and universities are state government creations, and not to consider the state’s needs at some appropriate level would be untenable and irresponsible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But does that duty extend to acting as a governor’s agent to impose a partisan agenda ahead of a university’s needs, its best interests and its culture and identity? Does it include intimidating, punishing or driving out college administrators or faculty who run afoul of the partisan orthodoxy of the day?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s clearly less tolerance on campuses for speech that many people strongly disfavor, and trying to disinvite speakers has become</span><a href="https://www.thefire.org/student-censorship-and-academic-growth-paradox-higher-education" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a thing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, says the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. Democratic-leaning students, FIRE found in its survey, were 19 percentage points more likely than Republican students to concur that there are times when speakers should be canceled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last spring, an online petition drive unsuccessfully demanded that the president of Virginia’s largest public university, George Mason University,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/03/gmus-president-is-right-to-reject-students-call-to-cancel-youngkins-commencement-speech/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">rescind Youngkin’s invitation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to speak at its commencement. The previous spring, an effort to block former Vice President Mike Pence from speaking at the University of Virginia was led by none other than its student newspaper, the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/18/when-a-student-newspaper-calls-for-banning-campus-speech-basic-freedoms-are-threatened/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cavalier Daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the</span><a href="https://www.progress-index.com/story/news/local/2023/12/03/free-speech-and-diversity-of-thought-task-force-on-campuses-requested-youngkin-charlottesville-uva/71771541007/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Progress-Index of Petersburg recently reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Youngkin last week hosted an invitation-only “Higher Education Summit on Free Speech and Intellectual Diversity” of public and private higher education leaders across the state on the UVA grounds. In a stunning paradox, participants later declined to talk with the press, the paper noted, saying they had been prohibited from doing so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Colleges, more than any place in society, should be hothouses for independent inquiry, intellectual ferment and unfettered expression; places to both be heard and to listen; for young men and women to freely chart their own paths in the world. Like the teens and twentysomethings who populate them, campuses tend to be complicated, often raucous and fast-changing. Some lean left or right more than others. Dispatching board members to campus on behalf of the governor as enforcers or indoctrinating emissaries is a fool’s errand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such an initiative also has structural failure points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is unique among Republican-dominated southern states in that it is loath to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/13/a-divided-government-is-virginias-natural-condition-has-been-for-50-years/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entrust total power to either party for too long</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as last month’s election attests. Not since the 1980s have voters given the Executive Mansion to one party for more than two terms (Democrats Chuck Robb in 1981, Gerald Baliles in 1985 and Doug Wilder in 1989). The last time one party controlled the executive and legislative branches of Virginia government, it was the Democrats for just two years, 2020-21, after which Youngkin was elected governor and the GOP won back its House majority. Two years later, Democrats took it back by a razor thin margin.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OHMzmYjQm1"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/13/a-divided-government-is-virginias-natural-condition-has-been-for-50-years/">A divided government is Virginia’s natural condition. Has been for 50 years.</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;A divided government is Virginia’s natural condition. Has been for 50 years.&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/13/a-divided-government-is-virginias-natural-condition-has-been-for-50-years/embed/#?secret=4CPY5AhaYD#?secret=OHMzmYjQm1" data-secret="OHMzmYjQm1" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next month, Youngkin’s executive branch becomes an island in a blue sea of elective institutions Democrats control, so his reach will be limited in the final biennium of the single, non-successive four-year term Virginia uniquely allows its governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means that even if his party retains the governor’s office and flips the House again in 2025, a different governor with different priorities and political patrons to satisfy will be appointing new visitors, and the Senate will still be Democratic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should a Democrat succeed Youngkin, the whiplash effect will be dramatic in the likely event that the new governor is as aggressive about dominating the college boards as Youngkin is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideologically-driven disruptions make continuity of planning for long-term goals at any given school — all with differing needs, opportunities, histories and challenges — difficult if not impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state’s demand for greater say in public colleges incongruously comes as modest increases in state support for higher education pale alongside stratospheric leaps in tuition and mandatory fees that students and their families pay, often assuming decades of debt in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a</span><a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED610242.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">November 2020 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, those costs increased at public institutions by an average of 120% since 1993. Over that same span, inflation-adjusted state support per full-time equivalent student at a public college or university increased just 28%, or about a percentage point a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question isn’t one of a board member’s fealty to the state or even a governor. That’s plainly inherent at some basic level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question is whether governors, present and future, exercise restraint or enlist their college board appointees as shock troops on yet another front in America’s culture clash.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a day that popular culture is quick to ascribe to early settlers who landed in Massachusetts sometime in the autumn or early winter of 1621. We see it in perennial promotions for the Black Friday shopping orgy manifest in cliché, cartoonish representations of pilgrim hats, square-toed shoes with big buckles and gobblers that resemble Virginia Tech’s sports mascot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians respond with patient bemusement, knowing that a service of thanksgiving to God was observed by British settlers two years earlier, in December 1619, along the James River in what was then known as Berkeley Hundred. The occasion was the successful completion of a harrowing trans-Atlantic passage to Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the</span><a href="https://virginiahistory.org/learn/first-thanksgiving" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Museum of History and Culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a ship named the Margaret, helmed by Capt. John Woodlief, had sailed from Bristol, England, with a crew of 37 men. They were so delighted to land in Virginia after three distressing months at sea that they conducted the first known organized expression of gratitude for the blessings of divine providence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a happy story!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were other crossings. Most have enjoyed far less acclaim and ritualistic celebration over the centuries in the United States. Let’s focus on one that found Virginia’s shores the same year as the Berkeley Hundred celebration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It landed in late August of 1619 in what is now Hampton, on the present day site of Fort Monroe. At the time, it went by the name Point Comfort. And the story of that voyage is the stuff of Hollywood adventure films.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ship, a Dutch-flagged vessel named the White Lion owned by an</span><a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-14553" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">English nobleman</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, carried</span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2674531" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">about 20 Africans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who had been kidnapped by Portuguese slave traders in Angola on Africa’s west coast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a</span><a href="https://time.com/5653369/august-1619-jamestown-history/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Time magazine summary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the White Lion and a sister privateer, the Treasurer, had commandeered the captives in an act of high seas piracy from the San Juan Batista, a Portuguese slave ship carrying an estimated 350 Angolans bound for the Spanish colony of Vera Cruz. Running low on food and supplies, the White Lion reached Point Comfort first and bartered its enslaved cargo for “victuals” from George Yeardley, the governor of the 12-year-old colony that had gotten a foothold at Jamestown, and Abraham Piercey, the colony’s head of trade. The Treasurer followed two days later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The landing at Point Comfort was significant as the first sale of human beings as slaves in what is now America. For nearly 250 more years, the slave trade was an evil that flourished in the United States. It made many whites wealthy and led the nation to disunion that culminated in what remains its bloodiest war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 1619 landing, however, was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first time enslaved Africans had been brought to America against their will as forced laborers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/misguided-focus-1619-beginning-slavery-us-damages-our-understanding-american-history-180964873/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Smithsonian Magazine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Africans were part of a Spanish expedition that landed in present-day South Carolina to establish a colony in 1526, an odyssey that was abandoned after the Africans rebelled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conditions for African captives — ripped away from their homes and families in several sub-Saharan nations in Africa, shackled and packed like firewood within the filthy, cramped, airless wooden ship’s hulls for months at sea — still horrify and haunt us. Their lives of backbreaking compulsory servitude in the New World, supporting the agrarian economies of antebellum southern states, were equally brutal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Union victory in the Civil War brought legal emancipation to enslaved Black people, but not an end to systemic victimization. Advances such as access to the ballot, desegregation of public facilities and the right to marry people of their choice, would take another full century, gains that would be slow and paid for with blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The contributions and innovations of those enslaved people and their progeny — from building much of this nation’s infrastructure to music and the arts, to cuisine, to science and an indispensable role in creating the world’s most productive font of food and fiber — struggle for mere acknowledgement, much less an expression of thanks and suitable compensation. And the past two years, it’s gotten even harder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve even gone so far as to proscribe unhappy facts like these from history and social sciences curricula in our public schools. The 1619 Point Comfort landing and the history of all the pain and conflict that has flowed from it risks being labeled an “inherently divisive concept” that might discomfit white pupils. Virginia’s governor, Glenn Youngkin, was so intent on reining in such history that</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to banish it from the commonwealth’s classrooms was literally his first official action as governor, done the afternoon he was inaugurated and announced with fanfare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, this isn’t a classroom. And last time I checked, the First Amendment still hadn’t been repealed, so I can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and will</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> note these culturally discomfiting truths.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most illuminating conversation I’ve had on the topic was with the grandson of enslaved people who made history of his own by becoming the nation’s first elected Black governor, L. Douglas Wilder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem we have is that American history has never been taught to Americans,”</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/06/05/removing-monuments-can-open-the-dialogue-but-coping-with-our-painful-history-is-necessary-for-reconciliation/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilder told me in June 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the start of a summer of protests that followed the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis cop. “I am not talking about adding a Black history course. I am talking about telling the damn truth in all our history about what has happened for the 400 years Black people have been here!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without that shared understanding of historical truth, Wilder said, Black America and white America will remain estranged. We get no closer when we designate a day in November to celebrate one historical event 404 years ago and try to hide or diminish another one just as old.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever notice that neither party tends to stay in power very long in Virginia? It’s become our natural condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cable TV politicos tend to get all breathless from time to time and dye Virginia cardinal red or cobalt blue, depending on which way the pendulum swings from one election cycle to the next. The truth is we’re a deep purple Goldilocks state — preferring our politics not too left, not too right — and have been for more than 50 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one of several distinctions that sets Virginia apart from its sister states in the South.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the latter 19th century through the 1960s, one-party rule was the order of the day. Virginia was a thoroughly Democratic state — wall-to-wall, from every courthouse and city hall to Capitol Square. Being Democratic then was the polar opposite of being Democratic today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a Democratic Party with roots in the antebellum South. It had defended slavery and pushed the nation toward the Civil War. In the 100 years after Appomattox, Dixie Democrats resisted Reconstruction and embraced Jim Crow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early 1920s in Virginia, it took form as the political machine founded by and named for Gov. Harry Flood Byrd. The racist excesses of that time stagger the conscience. Poll taxes. Voter literacy tests. Dr. Walter Plecker’s discredited</span><a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/plecker-walter-ashby-1861-1947/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">eugenics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that informed Hitler’s genocide against Europe’s Jews and his futile quest for a “master race” of Aryan </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">übermenschen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And there was </span><a href="https://virginiahistory.org/learn/civil-rights-movement-virginia/massive-resistance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massive Resistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia’s orchestrated defiance to the Supreme Court’s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision that outlawed racially segregated public education in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Kennedy presidency, the Democratic Party began its leftward arc and its hold on Virginia (and the South) began to slip. The cynical Republican “</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/a-grand-bargain-that-secured-the-south-for-the-gop/2019/08/16/64166948-976a-11e9-830a-21b9b36b64ad_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southern strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” first attempted by Barry Goldwater’s 1964 presidential campaign and perfected four years later by Richard Nixon, shifted the South, including Virginia, from a Democratic stronghold to reliably Republican in 1968. The commonwealth voted Republican in 10 consecutive presidential elections, ending with Barack Obama’s 2008 victory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1969, Linwood Holton, a social progressive who at last broke the back of segregation in Virginia, became its first elected Republican governor. Since then, partisan control of the governor’s office has changed hands half a dozen times, but neither party has held it for more than three consecutive terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly gradually transitioned from Democratic dominance through the 1980s to an even split and power sharing during the mid- to late ’90s before the GOP achieved hegemony in 1999, adding majorities in both legislative chambers to complement Gov. Jim Gilmore’s governorship. It was an enormous milestone for legislative Republicans, who once could have caucused in a broom closet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took the Democrats 20 years to climb back to total control of the legislative and executive branches of state government in the 2019 election – and just two years to lose it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During that Democratic biennium, numerous liberal reforms became law. Virginia became the only Southern state to</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0345" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">abolish the death penalty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Limited recreational use of</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/what-virginias-marijuana-legalization-bill-actually-says/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">marijuana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> became legal. The Republican voter</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/16/from-early-voting-to-photo-id-repeal-va-democrats-have-overhauled-election-rules-to-to-make-voting-easier/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">photo ID law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was scrapped, and no-excuse early and absentee voting were enacted. New restrictions were passed on gun ownership, including an end to bartering or selling firearms at</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB2&amp;201+sum+HB2" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">gun shows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without purchaser background checks and a “</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP0888" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">red flag law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” that bans gun possession by those ruled a risk to themselves or others by a court.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the 2021 election, a Virginia electorate – shaken by the COVID-19 pandemic, tiring of new President Joe Biden and sensing that Democrats in Richmond had gone too far too fast – handed the House majority back to the GOP and elected Republicans to the top three statewide offices, including Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of this year, Youngkin made a determined effort to win full legislative control and open the spillway for a flood of conservative priorities the hungry Republican base had wanted for more than 10 years. That included tightening the window for having abortions from 26 weeks of pregnancy to 15 with exceptions for victims of rape and incest and to protect the mother’s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, too far too fast. Again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the hazard of one-party control now, as moderates in both parties exit – either through retirement or primary losses to challengers farther from the political center – and legislators forsake compromise to push more ideologically-driven agendas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday’s election was a thunderous rebuke to Republicans nationally after a conservative Supreme Court in June 2022 struck down the Roe v. Wade decision that had kept abortions legal since 1973. The court effectively pushed abortion policy back to the nation’s 50 statehouses, and this week’s results left no doubt about voters’ enmity toward the ruling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ohioans overwhelmingly approved a referendum guaranteeing abortion rights in state law. In Kentucky, a Democratic governor who had pushed back against the state’s strict abortion laws was easily reelected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of its divided government, Virginia is the only Southern state that hasn’t imposed stringent limits on abortions, some of them amounting to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">de facto</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bans. Youngkin and his party saw the opportunity to follow suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had masterfully disarmed moderate to Democratic-leaning suburbanites in winning the governor’s race two years earlier. He leveraged pandemic disruptions to public education and marginalized roles of parents in their children’s schools as resonant kitchen table issues in a campaign that showed Republicans how to overcome former President Donald Trump’s toxic legacy and blaze a new path to victory in a state Democrats had owned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believed he had struck gold again with his 15-week abortion proposal, something he saw as a compromise that could counter Democrats’ attacks on the visceral reproductive rights argument. Even more, he hoped, the strategy could allow Republican legislative candidates to turn the tables and position Democrats as extremists for supporting longer intervals for legal abortions. Youngkin’s PAC, Spirit of Virginia, crushed gubernatorial fundraising records and poured more than</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/374333-spirit-of-virginia/?start_year=2022&amp;end_year=2023&amp;recip_type=all" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$15 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behind GOP candidates by October’s end, including a late $1.4 million ad blitz touting his abortion plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to bet big to win big. Or lose big. And Youngkin lost. Big.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the precincts reported and the numbers were crunched, not only did the Senate remain in Democratic hands, Republicans had also lost control of the House — after just two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for at least the next few years, a diminished Youngkin will </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pro</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pose and the Democratic legislature will </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">dis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pose. Each will frustrate and obstruct the other. The adversarial process will assure a Goldilocks outcome, preventing passage of anything too left or too right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, as Virginians made clear on Tuesday, we’re OK with that.</span></p>

Here, we never take a year off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This evening, before the polls open, take a stroll if you can through your neighborhood. Maybe even drive around your community — roll the window down, weather permitting. Look around. Listen. Feel. Breathe in the cool fall air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Election eve long ago became perhaps my most special night on each year’s calendar. It was because of the resolute, almost reverential calm that pervaded the darkened streets and neighborhoods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the overwhelming balance of my adult life, elections were my business. I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lived </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">them as a newsman and political correspondent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the weekends preceding each election, I had studied published polls and campaign finance data and traveled extensively across Virginia. I had made countless phone calls to local party leaders, candidates, campaign professionals, registrars and “real people” I had met in my reporting. Rarely did any election night result surprise me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reporters and editors spent Mondays before elections polishing the background and contextual material at the bottom of stories that would be transmitted the next day to publications and broadcasters across Virginia and beyond. That material would remain unchanged but the tops of the stories were revised many times Tuesday night into Wednesday’s wee hours with fresh tallies and trends until, eventually, The Associated Press declared a winner and announced it with a bulletin, the next-highest priority level for wire-service reports behind a flash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such was the caffeine- and adrenaline-fueled work within the pressure cooker that was election night in AP’s state control bureaus as vote totals flooded in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the night before, when I would invariably leave work late, I’d often take the long way home, sometimes varying my route through different parts of town. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The streets were conspicuously empty and quiet except maybe for falling leaves rustling in the breeze. Bars and eateries, where autumn Monday nights normally meant lively pro football crowds, seemed sparse and subdued. Some households had displayed their support for certain candidates with yard signs that, by then, had largely exhausted any expectation of influencing the undecided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all the biting rhetoric and the acidic ads, after all the claims and counterclaims and liberties taken with the truth, after all the debates and breathless campaign reporting, after all the final rallies had ended, now the voters would have their say – the only say that matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The anticipation felt palpable: the people’s pent-up will was about to be made manifest in the seminal triumph of representative democracy. It seemed an almost sacred moment, and it always inspired me. It probably will tonight, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This evening, let yourself </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in our collective wisdom; that we as voters get it right more often than not. Even if the candidate (or candidates) of your choice fall short, trust that it’s better than unaccountable and unelected power imposing its will upon us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trust that your votes are being fairly and faithfully collected and counted by honorable people just like you who are doing their best, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">because</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another edifying aspect of my years of daily political reporting was Election Day visits to urban, rural and suburban polling places where I met citizens who gave earnestly of their time and worked long, tiring hours at local precincts to ensure that their neighbors’ votes mattered. The same goes for dutiful, skilled career election professionals, regardless of the party in power, who kept the processes clean and transparent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government of, by and for the people took root here 247 years ago. Over that time, suffrage was justly expanded to populations once disenfranchised — women and the descendants of enslaved people chief among them. There is still work yet to do. However, there is no guarantee that our constitutional democracy will make it to 250 years, as malignant forces hell-bent on authoritarian rule seek power by any means, up to and including</span> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56004916" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seditious violence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One generation cannot bequeath the blessings of freedom to the next. It must be earned and defended anew through informed vigilance, intentional electoral participation and the courage to stand against those who prosper from dividing Americans and turning one against the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So tonight, take it all in. Savor the quiet resolve of Americans — Virginians, your neighbors — about to choose their government in our fragile annual exercise of the peaceful delegation of power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomorrow, cast your vote and then watch the machinery of democracy and the rule of law run their righteous course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember and cherish it. We risk its loss sooner than we dare imagine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it selfish for Democrats on Capitol Square to want her to leave Capitol Hill and proclaim her candidacy for governor in 2025?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means giving up her seat representing a district she first won in 2018, back when its critical mass was the centrist western suburbs of Richmond and a number of nearby rural localities stretching almost to Horse Country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Spanberger unseated Republican Rep. Dave Brat five years ago, it was a significant moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans had owned the 7th District for generations, until the blue wave election that was largely a referendum on Donald Trump’s toxic presidency. When she took her seat in the House in January 2019, she was the first Democrat to fill it since Rep. John O. Marsh retired almost 50 years earlier — when Three Dog Night was packing concert venues, $4,000 could buy a brand new Chevy Impala (fully loaded), and four Kent State University students protesting the Vietnam War were shot dead by Ohio National Guard troops a few months earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six Republicans held the seat over that time, including one-termer George Allen, who stepped aside rather than battle incumbent French Slaughter after a Democratic Legislature in 1991 redistricted them both into the 7th. Allen got the last laugh, using the forced hiatus to harness a restive and growing conservatism and win a stunning come-from-behind election as governor two years later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody’s squeezing Spanberger out of her seat. Since beating Brat, she has fought off two fiercely contested Republican reelection challenges. Her record as a Democrat unafraid to</span><a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Nancy-Pelosi-Abigail-Spanberger-call-defund-police-15707741.php" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">buck her own party’s noisy left flank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and even</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/09/30/spanberger-blasts-pelosi-calling-for-new-leadership/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">its leadership</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives her the middle-of-the-road bona fides necessary to win in her redrawn district that takes in exurban/suburban Prince William County and Republican-voting localities farther from the Occoquan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats who focus on Capitol Hill are keenly aware of the risk involved in losing the incumbency and Spanberger’s well-known profile in what’s shaping up as an almost existential partisan battle for control of Congress next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of the 435 seats matters in the coming quest for a House majority. That became clear to the world after a clique of fringe House Republicans</span><a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2023/10/04/what-does-speaker-house-do-who-elects-how-representatives-vote/71055033007/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">staged the ouster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of their own speaker for brokering an 11th-hour stopgap funding bill that averted a federal government shutdown. As Congress lay speakerless and paralyzed for more than three weeks, war erupted between Israel and Hamas that threatens to consume the Middle East, and the nation watched helplessly as it drew nearer another federal shutdown if Congress doesn’t act by Nov. 17, when the 45-day stopgap funding expires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are already tasked with finding a candidate who can hold the seat of Rep. Jennifer Wexton, who is retiring from her 10th District seat in Northern Virginia and part of the Shenandoah Valley over health concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eileen Filler-Corn, the first woman and the first Jew to be speaker of the House of Delegates, had entertained a run for governor, but downsized her ambitions and</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-10-18/filler-corn-wexton-virginia-governor-congress" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announced her candidacy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Wexton’s seat on Oct. 18. Her move struck a sour chord with leaders of the Loudoun County Democratic Committee who criticized the timing of her announcement, made shortly after the Israeli-Hamas war began. According to the</span><a href="https://www.loudountimes.com/news/filler-corn-faces-pushback-from-loudoun-dems-after-announcing-congressional-campaign/article_4ca3da00-6f8f-11ee-8f2a-abdf201889bf.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Loudoun Times-Mirror</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the committee called her announcement “premature” and accused her of citing her Jewish heritage to use </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the horrible events of the past two weeks for her personal political gain.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see why both parties want their first teamers in the game next fall, particularly in swing districts like the 7th. But you can also see why the skillset that made Spanberger the Democrat who won the swing congressional district where others had failed for decades also makes her a strong contender to lead her party’s ticket in 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One potential primary rival she might face for the 2025 Democratic nomination is Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney. He had been in former Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s cabinet before he dived into the leachate pond of Richmond municipal politics in 2016. A nomination battle between them would present an interesting early contest to determine which candidate could appeal to the party’s progressive base without alienating centrists who dominate the suburbs and are indispensable to the party in fall elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should Spanberger be the nominee, she would not be Virginia’s first female Democratic standard bearer. That was Mary Sue Terry, a former state attorney general, whom Allen defeated with 58% of the vote in 1993 despite Terry’s large early advantages in polling and fundraising.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Spanberger could be part of Virginia’s first all-woman gubernatorial general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Winsome Earle-Sears, with only a short stint in the House of Delegates from Norfolk as her lone exposure to state politics, has had a meteoric rise in the Republican Party. Little more than the answer to a state politics trivia question three years ago, she won the GOP nomination and then election as lieutenant governor on the 2021 Republican ticket led by political neophyte Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most formidable potential nomination challenger to Earle-Sears’s would likely be  Attorney General Jason Miyares, the son of a Cuban refugee. A GOP primary between Earle-Sears, who is Black, and Miyares would be the most diverse in state history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Spanberger, none of the aforementioned political heavyweights has made any public announcement of their 2025 intentions, and who can blame them? We’re on the eve of arguably Virginia’s most fiercely contested, consequential and certainly the most expensive state legislative election ever, with total GOP control of Virginia government at stake. If they flip a few Democratic seats in the state Senate and hold a thin House majority, the Republicans would consolidate full control of state government for the first time since 2013. That’s why bigfooting next week’s contests would be exceedingly poor form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year from now, however, we will know what became of Spanberger’s and Wexton’s seats in Congress. And with that, the candidates and Virginia voters will have a much clearer vision of what the future holds, on Capitol Hill </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Capitol Square.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Answer: five. One to put in a new bulb, but only after a protracted, emotional debate with the other four about the painful necessity of parting with the old one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep, change comes mighty slow here in the Old Dominion. We cling to anachronisms like cat hair to polyester pants. That includes hoary rites and prerogatives rooted in the British monarchy our forebears won a war against to form our democratic republic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of them is the imperative of putting the full duty of felons’ rights restoration on one chief executive, the governor (who enjoys the monarchical salutation “His Excellency” at official ceremonies and stuffy, high-flown social occasions).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pardons, reprieves, clemency and rights restoration are specifically delegated to the governor by the Virginia Constitution. Governors have folks around them to help decide who gets the slate wiped clean and who doesn’t, but it’s not a duty to be outsourced. When it comes right down to it, His Excellency alone decides which individuals with felony records regain the right to vote, hold elective office, serve as notaries or are selected for juries after they successfully reenter society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put aside for the moment ideological and/or ethical qualms over the prospect of the state’s most powerful political figure holding sole, unfettered discretion over which one-time offenders get to vote and which do not.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LNXYjBiJjY"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/21/restoration-of-rights-should-be-automatic/">Restoration of rights should be automatic</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Restoration of rights should be automatic&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/21/restoration-of-rights-should-be-automatic/embed/#?secret=MAXetaKpXu#?secret=LNXYjBiJjY" data-secret="LNXYjBiJjY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know of smelly, end-of-term clemency sprees by presidents and governors that paid off past favors. None was bigger (or smellier) than President Gerald Ford’s preemptive pardon of his recently resigned predecessor, Richard Nixon, for egregious criminal abuses exposed by the Watergate scandal. That pardon, more than any other, made possible the one-term presidency of Jimmy Carter, who riled many Americans at the time with his blanket pardon of those who dodged the military draft during the Vietnam War.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider it instead from a purely practical standpoint: how does one guy equitably judge the merits of tens of thousands of released felons’ applications in a timely way? Sure, he’s got staff support from the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s office and input from the Department of Corrections. But is it the best use of time for a governor and a cabinet-level office to be vetting restoration-of-rights requests from folks who hot-wired and stole a car 20 years ago at age 18, or who went to prison after being caught in someone’s house near a stash of crack and a stolen gun?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more than a decade, governors of both parties prided themselves on setting up processes to expeditiously reward those who’ve paid their due and renounced their rough and rowdy past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, in the final year of his four-year term, was the first to effectively make restoration automatic for nonviolent felons who had done their time and completed parole and probation requirements. Citing a belief in forgiveness and second chances born of his Catholic faith, McDonnell returned more than 10,000 former offenders to full citizenship before he clocked out in January 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His two Democratic successors put the process on steroids. By the time Terry McAuliffe and Ralph Northam — the 72nd and 73rd governors, respectively — left office, more than 300,000 former felons had their right to vote reinstated, eliminating the backlog who had sought restoration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McAuliffe, during his term, issued a series of executive orders intended to restore the franchise to felons who completed all their post-conviction obligations </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">en masse</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2016, the state Supreme Court sharply</span><a href="https://www.eji.org/files/howell-v-mcauliffe-virginia-supreme-court-decision-07-22-16.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">struck down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his efforts, holding that the sweeping blanket authority he asserted to restore the vote to a class of felons rather than specific individuals was incompatible with Virginia’s Constitution.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="d1E9iTH6oY"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/28/can-a-suit-tied-to-an-1870-law-finally-end-va-s-feudal-felon-rights-restoration-regimen/">Can a suit tied to an 1870 law finally end Va.’s feudal felon rights restoration regimen?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Can a suit tied to an 1870 law finally end Va.’s feudal felon rights restoration regimen?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/28/can-a-suit-tied-to-an-1870-law-finally-end-va-s-feudal-felon-rights-restoration-regimen/embed/#?secret=x3hWXEiP3r#?secret=d1E9iTH6oY" data-secret="d1E9iTH6oY" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, McAuliffe and his successors began swiftly and individually enfranchising applicants who completed their sentences. That included Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin for the first year of his term before he rescinded the policy seven months ago, slowing the pace to a trickle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Against that backdrop, Youngkin’s rights-restoration constipation earned the commonwealth another reputational blemish last week when a</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/us/voting-rights-felons.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exposed inequities inherent in Virginia’s antiquated regimen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It tells the story of George Hawkins, who did 13 years for attempted murder when he was 17, finished his post-release obligations, applied to the governor to gain his voting rights and has been rejected twice without explanation. It notes that a</span><a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-2023-04-06-complaint.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lawsuit in U.S. District Court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging Youngkin’s process has been allowed to proceed over the state’s motion to dismiss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Times’ reporting also starkly shows what an outlier Virginia is on the issue of rights restoration. Virginia and Kentucky are the only states that still vest all voting rights restoration decisions for felons in their governors, </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the National Conference of State Legislatures. Unlike Virginia, however, Kentucky governors can issue blanket restorations via executive order, as Gov. Andy Beshear did in 2019, leaving Virginia in a league of its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Virginia NAACP alleged that race was a motivation in Youngkin’s decision to throttle down the process, his secretary of the commonwealth, Kay Coles James, forcefully rebutted the assertion in a two-page letter to state NAACP president Robert N. Barnette Jr. She said applications do not collect data on the applicant’s race, religion or ethnicity. If some felons are not getting their rights restored quickly enough, she wrote, it’s because Youngkin generally prioritizes applications from nonviolent offenders over those who used a firearm.<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/07172023-KCJ-letter-to-NAACP.pdf" class="pdfemb-viewer" style="" data-width="max" data-height="max" data-toolbar="bottom" data-toolbar-fixed="off">07172023 KCJ letter to NAACP</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so it goes: the ceaseless point/counterpoint rhetoric; the litigation that quibbles and nibbles around the edges. It gets us no closer to a lasting, 21st century solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real change requires a state constitutional amendment, something that has been tried several times, unsuccessfully, since the 1980s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, a proposed constitutional amendment must pass both chambers of the General Assembly unchanged in consecutive years separated by a legislative election before it goes to voters for ratification (or rejection) in a statewide referendum. It has never made it to the ballot, with the most recent effort failing last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial passage came in the 2021 session when Democrats held House and Senate majorities and the governor’s office. A year later, after Republicans swept the 2021 state elections, the</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sj1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">second passage was snuffed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a House subcommittee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another shot at modernizing Virginia’s suffrage policy for penitent felons is not on the horizon given the current composition of the legislative and executive branches, even if Democrats hold their tenuous Senate majority in next month’s legislative election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then, people who have spent years staring at a concrete wall and locked steel bars may have a different perspective on time than most of us.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin delivers the State of the Commonwealth to the Virginia General Assembly Jan. 11, 2023. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things looked pretty bleak for Virginia Republicans rounding the final turn into the stretch run of the Nov. 7 election for all 140 General Assembly seats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just days after early and absentee voting began statewide, it looked for all the world that a cabal of tinfoil hat-wearing right-wingers in the U.S. House of Representatives would impose their will on Speaker Kevin McCarthy and prevent passage of legislation that would continue funding the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blame for the ensuing shutdown would have fallen squarely on a deeply riven House Republican Conference after extremists in the party’s thin majority threatened to oust McCarthy from his always-tenuous hold on the gavel should he compromise with the 98 percent of Congress that’s sane to avert a shutdown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Closing the federal government not only looks bad, it would have caused significant hardships in states like Virginia, where Uncle Sam spends tons of money on stuff like the military, civilian employees and federal and defense contractors. How bad? George Mason University political science professor Mark Rozell</span><a href="https://richmond.com/opinion/columnists/mark-rozell-a-federal-shutdown-vexes-virginia-gop-in-pivotal-legislative-races/article_008fe176-5e1f-11ee-a3f9-93698899001a.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">broke it down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently for the Richmond Times-Dispatch. All of which had Gov. Glenn Youngkin, and other Republicans heavily vested in winning full legislative control in Virginia, seriously worried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, suddenly, the storm clouds cleared. On Saturday, Sept. 30, just hours from a midnight shutdown, McCarthy reached out to Democrats and together they passed a compromise spending bill to keep the government open for another 45 days. It wasn’t the sweeping, forward-looking and confident commitment one hopes for from our elected leaders, but it’s enough to get Youngkin and the Republicans in Virginia past the Nov. 7 state Senate and House of Delegates election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three days later, the House’s GOP Chaos Caucus made good on its threat and, aided by Democrats who don’t like McCarthy, narrowly prevailed in history’s first ouster of a sitting U.S. House speaker. Now speakerless, Congress is just a sad collection of 534 old, rich people lacking the authority to decide anything more momentous than whether to order lunch from Domino’s or Little Caesar’s. (It would have been 535 but for the recent passing of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, rest her soul.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whiplash-fast turn of events had to be unsettling for our governor. Having been in elective politics only about two years, he retains some of his humanity. I suspect His Excellency is sincerely troubled that Kevin McCarthy did the right and responsible thing — at least for the Virginia GOP if not for the nation — only to get it in the neck from renegades in his own caucus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decent fellow that he is, I can easily imagine our governor writing a note of thanks to McCarthy, then amending it to double as a letter of condolence. Taking satirical license, I think it might go something like this:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Executive Mansion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond, Virginia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Near midnight, October 3, 2023</span></p>
<p><del><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker</span></del><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Congressman McCarthy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Capitol</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington, D.C.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Kevin,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for saving my bacon the Saturday before last!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I — heck, the whole darn Virginia Republican Party, for that matter — owe you. Bigly! You did us a solid, pal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sucks what happened to you because of it — getting ousted as speaker and whatnot. You know what they say: “No good deed goes unpunished.” (Hehe!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t see any of this coming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d been waking in the middle of the night, night after night, in a cold sweat envisioning families of tens of thousands of troops stationed at Virginia bases going weeks, even months without paychecks — some of them with breadwinners deployed overseas!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d imagined tens upon tens of thousands of federal workers who jam the freeways or take the VRE every day to jobs in or around the district sitting home on furlough, binge-watching “Bar Rescue” or “Below Deck” marathons until their cable gets disconnected. I could see grocery stores and gas stations losing sales, landlords trying to collect rent from families with no income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could see huge defense contractors in my state like General Dynamics and Raytheon scaling back on multi-billion-dollar contracts and laying workers off because the Pentagon can’t make its payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could see smaller businesses that supply government offices with stuff like copier paper, cleaning supplies and bottled water having to let voting Virginians go because monthly invoices are piling up unpaid in some bureaucrat’s empty cubicle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I could see every one of them blaming us Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your brave, principled and commonsense 11th-hour action averted all of that. You did it knowing that Congressman Matt Gaetz and his fellow truants would be lurking around the corner to give you a wedgie and stuff you in your locker. You didn’t back down, refusing to apologize for doing the right thing. You went on the Sunday morning shows to tell Gaetz and his clique to “bring it.” You had that steely Clint Eastwood mojo working for a minute. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cool!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then, well … they brought it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you’re just one of 435 again as Congress waits in leaderless limbo for however long it takes our fellow Republicans to pick God-</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">knows</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-who to replace you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not your fault, of course, but what Virginia voters see as we hit the shank of early voting season is our party behaving like a circular firing squad. Maybe it won’t be as awful as a shutdown, but it ain’t great, either.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaaaa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nyhoo …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just wanted to drop you a note of congratulations/appreciation/sympathy on recent events. Give me a holler if you’re down Richmond way. Let’s grab a coffee!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Glenn</span></p>

(Chris Davis)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to imagine the ecosystem of Virginia’s General Assembly in the late decades of the 1900s and the first couple of the 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century without Charlie Davis, known and universally celebrated as “the sin lobbyist.” He animated the place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlie, a smooth urbanite who never strayed too far from his Rocky Mount, Virginia roots, passed away Sept. 18 at age 77 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer and a brief bout with COVID-19, according to</span><a href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/richmond-va/charles-davis-11467778" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">his obituary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He embraced his role as the champion of the vices. His clients included institutions and major corporations that were leading purveyors of tobacco, alcohol and motion pictures. To have met him was to never forget him, a priceless asset in the field of public policy advocacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlie dressed and lived the part. He prowled the corridors of power in perfectly fitted charcoal gray or black suits, often a dark shirt and contrasting tie, his longish silvery hair swept elegantly back and his beard closely cropped and neatly trimmed. A handkerchief, often complementing his tie, blossomed from the breast pocket of his jacket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former Richmond radio reporter, Charlie innately understood the Capitol Square press corps, back when the press had a much stronger voice in public affairs than it does now. He knew better than to harangue the scribes or, worse, approach them with empty, saccharine entreaties. Charlie offered us something far more irresistible: actionable information, usually on dealings that somebody important wanted to keep quiet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With his perpetual leering grin, Charlie would sidle up beside a journalist and say something like, “If somebody got up </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> early and sat outside a certain Appropriations Committee chairman’s door at 6:30 tomorrow morning, that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">somebody</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might come away with one </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hell</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a story.” The tips almost always paid off because Charlie was almost always right. Little happened on that square that didn’t find its way to his ears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlie’s advocacy made vices seem virtuous. Until widespread public perceptions of tobacco and even secondhand smoke soured and smoking, beset by overwhelming medical evidence that it caused serious and even fatal illnesses, was ultimately banned in Virginia’s public dining and hospitality venues, he had a stunning run of success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day in the early 2000s in a crowded Senate Finance Committee meeting, witness after witness had spoken compellingly in favor of increasing state taxes on tobacco. That didn’t sit well with Philip Morris, owner of the world’s largest cigarette factory a few miles from the Capitol. Among the last witnesses was Charlie, whom senators greeted by name like an old pal who had arrived fashionably late at their reunion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He coolly leaned against the rostrum, adjusted the microphone and, in his sonorous  voice and a slow, measured cadence, said, “Philip Morris … opposes … this bill.” Minutes later, after the committee clerk called the roll, the bill lay dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once, in a push for more state support for the Virginia Film Office, Charlie hired a local actress who appeared in regional television commercials to play Marilyn Monroe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She wore the same sort of shimmering, form-fitting, low-cut sheath that Monroe wore for her</span><a href="https://youtu.be/qvoqK6aLE2E?feature=shared" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">breathy, seductive rendition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of “Happy Birthday” to President John F. Kennedy in 1962. Strategically stationed in the teeming atriums outside committee rooms on the first floor of the old General Assembly Building, Charlie’s Marilyn lookalike cut through the day’s noise and clutter like a</span><a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/lightsaber/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lightsaber</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and got the message across to legislators — the male ones anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Jones Davis III was a rascal. He could flawlessly project himself as Joe Sixpack or a worldly, latter-day boulevardier, depending on the needs of the moment. He excelled at what he did because of the Everyman we saw in him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitol Square — Virginia, for that matter — is poorer without Charlie. At a minimum, it’s a damn sight less interesting.</span></p>

Due to the continuing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, many schools continue to hold practices with a plan for a limited season of 6 games total with restricted access to only coaches and relatives of players able to attend.

Players wear their jerseys to school on game day. Storefronts in small towns are festooned in school colors. Occasionally, even a parade!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then it’s almost game time. As the setting sun bathes the field in a golden hue, the bands enter, colorfully regaled and marching in time to the rattle and clicking of snare drums and the resonant thud of the bass. The aroma of concession stand popcorn mingles with that of freshly mown grass as the teams finish their warmups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward to today’s high school games; in the student body section of the stands, there’s just a  smattering. Way more empty seats than classmates. That’s even truer for the area reserved for the visiting team’s students across the way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things are unusually sedate in the parking lot, too. In past years, before this ancient annual grudge match that stirred the school pride of grandparents and maybe even great-grandparents of current students, there was usually tailgating outside the stadium in the hour or so leading up to kickoff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not tonight. Just a trickle of grim-faced people walking briskly to the gate and displaying tickets purchased online well in advance, rendering walk-up ticket sales obsolete. They pass through magnetometers or get wanded before they’re allowed to proceed through the gate, lest someone try to smuggle in a weapon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henrico County’s Hermitage and Highland Springs high schools </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/local-news/henrico-county/hermitage-high-school-changes-spectator-policy-after-fights-at-football-games/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced such security protocols</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for all home football games that took effect last week. The new rules forbid anyone under age 18 — even students — from entering the game unaccompanied by an adult. All ticket sales are online and none will be sold after noon on game day. They forbid gathering and loitering before or after the games in parking areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what we’ve come to in an era of escalating gratuitous violence and bloodshed that now threatens some of the events we hold dearest and that have long bonded our communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, excess school pride might boil over and get settled with fistfights or, worse, gunfire. A disagreement over a referee’s questionable call might require postgame police escorts for the officiating crew. A callous remark about a player’s performance or a majorette may end up with one person departing the stadium in an ambulance and another leaving in handcuffs. Moms and dads intrude onto fields of play  to verbally —</span><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/soccer/virginia-youth-soccer-coach-suffers-facial-fracture-bruising-after-alleged-attack-by-parent/ar-AA1fXibB" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sometimes physically</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — accost youth sports coaches and officials as their children watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the hell?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not as though we couldn’t see it coming with the steady breakdown of civility in society, even before the pandemic. We are a society that increasingly assumes license to act out its bloodiest impulses. Then COVID-19 disrupted life as we knew it and demolished the remaining moral guardrails we all had respected as part of life in a civilized society.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One measure of the problem is reflected in a nationwide study of bodies that sanction high school sports and other interscholastic competitions. A 50-state survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations found that about</span><a href="https://www.nfhs.org/articles/with-loss-of-50-000-officials-nfhs-organizes-consortium-to-find-solutions/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">50,000 sports officials</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had quit in the past three years. Part, but not all, of the blame went to oratorical and actual abuse and threats they endure from fans, snarling with rage and unable to control themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the problem became so acute that many prep football games — once as synonymous with Friday nights as church is with Sundays — are being scheduled for</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/sports/a-record-low-of-officials-could-have-a-major-impact-on-high-school-football" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Thursday nights or Saturdays</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because there aren’t enough officials to field full seven-member crews for all games on one night of the week. Now, many amateur sports officials work multiple nights each week to cover all the games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threats and boorish fans are one thing. Bullets are another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In just the past month, games were interrupted and ended early because of shootings near high school games in</span><a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=1c95e572faefaf3fJmltdHM9MTY5NDM5MDQwMCZpZ3VpZD0wYTcxMmYwZi03NzdjLTY5YzItMzYxOS0zYzhjNzZjYjY4MDgmaW5zaWQ9NTQ0Mg&amp;ptn=3&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=0a712f0f-777c-69c2-3619-3c8c76cb6808&amp;psq=recent+shooting+in+utica+ny&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXN1bmlvbi5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL3RlZW4tYXJyZXN0ZWQtYWZ0ZXItYS1ndWFyZC1zaG90LWJyZWFraW5nLXVwLWEtMTgzNTkyODkucGhw&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Utica, New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/02/port-allen-football-game-shooting-leaves-one-dead-in-louisiana/70750281007/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Baton Rouge, Louisiana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the</span><a href="https://www.actionnews5.com/2023/08/11/3-minors-1-adult-charged-cordova-high-school-jamboree-shooting/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Memphis suburb</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Cordova in Tennessee, and</span><a href="https://youtu.be/1ulTtM-x8b0?feature=shared" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Choctaw, Oklahoma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s heartbreaking, it should come as no surprise that wanton, life-threatening violence now stalks school sports arenas. In June, a gunman outside</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/crime-courts/huguenot-graduation-shooting-vcu/article_bf96f2aa-04d1-11ee-b449-af6d054fe55b.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Huguenot’s graduation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> killed a graduate and another man. In January, a 6-year-old boy smuggled a gun from his home into his classroom, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/virginia-school-shooting-boy-6-zwerner-richneck-eeeac96418220aee71cdd296c0089821" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shot his first grade teacher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Newport News elementary school and allegedly bragged about it afterward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security measures once considered draconian are becoming the new normal at what has always been among the safest public gatherings possible: Our children’s school events. Don’t blame school administrators. Lawless choices others have made left them no choice, and they are to be lauded for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not clear how many schools have enacted safety protocols similar to those the two Henrico schools announced last week. There is no central repository for cataloging such protective initiatives, officials at the Virginia High School League and the Virginia Association of School Superintendents said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, expect more of it, not less, said Scott Brabrand, who was superintendent of Virginia’s largest school district in Fairfax County before he became executive director of the VASS last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is going to become part of the landscape,” he said in an interview last week. “No event can be held now without putting the security lens on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Principals and superintendents are seeing the same increasing threats that police are. It’s a problem for which there are few, if any, remedial templates, so schools are having to innovate somewhat to protect students, parents, fans and officials at their events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new rules may feel burdensome, but the alternative is to surrender these treasured events and venerated traditions in the life of a school and its students. Spectators may not relish the changes, Brabrand said, “but they don’t want to be looking over their shoulders all the time to make sure they’re safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have an easy answer,” Brabrand said. “There just don’t seem to be barriers any more to when and where these things might happen.”</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of watching Democrats earn tens of thousands of ballots cast early in Virginia elections, Gov. Glenn Youngkin this year did something logical and refreshing if not, by some measures, brazen: He urged his fellow Republicans to vote early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about that a second. Why should stating obvious common sense and a laudable civic goal be remarkable?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Republicans, poisoned by the dark ruminations of a desperate and paranoid ex-president, came to believe during the past few years that early voting – particularly voting by mail – is an orchestrated Democratic scheme to commit election fraud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quadruple criminal defendant and former President Donald Trump’s </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/donald-trump-mugshot-georgia-jail-fulton-county-arrest-rcna101664" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">falsehoods about a stolen election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> baked distrust of anything other than on-site Election Day balloting deep into the MAGA Republican psyche.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/10/31/two-years-after-election-turmoil-gop-voters-remain-skeptical-on-elections-vote-counts/pp_2022-10-31_election-turmoil_01-010/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last October found that in-person Republican voters are more dubious that their votes will be counted as they intended than voters who support Democratic candidates, indicating that the distrust Trump sowed in refusing to accept his loss two years earlier had not dissipated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s set aside the absurd idea that Democrats could orchestrate anything more complicated than a one-car funeral procession. Not much has changed in the century since Will Rogers said, “I don’t belong to any organized political party. I’m a Democrat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has early and absentee voting benefited Democrats? Sure. It removed impediments to voting for some of their natural constituencies, including the poor, the elderly, minorities andpeople with inflexible work schedules. And, as Youngkin himself concedes, Democrats have made far better use of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But equating it with fraud is corrosive to the essential truth that one of the few things our ever-evolving republic continues to do well is free and fair elections that enable the peaceful transfer of power (though Jan. 6, 2021, forever puts an asterisk on the “peaceful” part).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why so many welcomed Youngkin’s recent appeal to his party to embrace early and absentee voting. He acknowledged the functionality and necessity of it earlier this month in a</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/08/13/early-voting-key-republicans-win-elections/70569308007/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">USA Today op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even gave Democrats grudging credit for creating a system he now urges Republicans to use as their own in a concerted bid to take full legislative control this fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Democrats put these rules in place while in control of Virginia’s government and have used these rules to their advantage by vastly outpacing Republicans in early and absentee voting,” he wrote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Virginia Republicans who’ve taken the time and done the math support the governor. In a July radio interview with conservative broadcaster John Fredericks, state Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant and Fredericks both extolled the necessity of playing the Democrats’ early-voting game better than the Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a way that forces us to make sure everybody votes,” Dunnavant said. “I’m not afraid of everybody voting; I just don’t want to leave my votes on the table.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dunnavant, R-Henrico, isn’t just singing in Youngkin’s amen chorus. She’s deeply leveraged because of her November reelection bid against Democratic challenger Del. Schuyler Van Valkenberg in a suburban Richmond swing district. It’s a contest that both parties consider strategically critical to Senate control. It’s likely to be among the most expensive legislative races in Virginia history.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Party of Virginia chairman Rich Anderson, in a separate interview with Fredericks, was even more blunt: “This is vital to victory in November.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even Fredericks — an unabashed Trump stalwart — differs with fellow Republicans who still react to early and absentee voting the way Dracula reacts to a crucifix.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To resist this is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">insanity</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Fredericks said. “To resist this, you are ensuring our continual defeat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If emulation by your adversary is the sincerest form of praise, then this is where Democrats say, “Thank you … I</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> guess</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what if Youngkin is cynically employing liberalized voting enacted by Democrats as a tactic to juice GOP turnout in this fall’s go-for-broke, off-off-year Virginia legislative elections? Making it easier for registered voters, regardless of party, to exercise their franchise should be saluted universally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here’s to you, Your Excellency!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is that while Youngkin broadens voter participation, local electoral boards in some jurisdictions — all controlled by members of the sitting governor’s party as state law directs — are unashamedly doing the opposite by closing in-person early voting sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting early was, by any reckoning, a hassle in Virginia until three years ago. It required photo identification and a voter stating, under pain of perjury, that absentee balloting was necessitated by one of a limited menu of exceptions such as business travel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In early 2020, pushed by the social distancing imperatives of the terrifying new COVID-19 pandemic and with Democrats in charge of both the General Assembly and the governor’s office, Virginia enacted</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1&amp;ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">no-excuse absentee and early voting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It allows voters to receive and return ballots by mail or cast ballots at specified sites beginning </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/early-absentee/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">45 days ahead of an election</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for any reason or none at all. It allows voters to opt in to permanently and automatically receive ballots by mail, a welcomed and empowering accommodation for people unable to make it to the polls on election day. A</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1968" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">separate law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also enacted that year also permits local electoral boards or general registrars to make Sunday in-person voting available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early voting for the Nov. 7 election opens on Friday, Sept. 22. The deadline to register in time to vote this fall is Monday, Oct. 16. To receive a mail-in ballot, your local voter registrar must receive your request no later than 5 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 27.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some localities, however, are </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/15/cost-shouldnt-be-the-main-factor-in-operating-satellite-voting-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tightening the screws on voters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the Richmond Electoral Board’s GOP majority </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/27/gop-electoral-boards-move-to-cut-richmond-early-voting-sites-may-have-been-illegal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted 2-1 to close</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> two of the city’s three early voting sites, drawing an immediate warning letter from the city attorney that the move was illegal. This month, the board thought better of its decision and rescinded it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, the Chesapeake City Council voted 8-1 for an Electoral Board recommendation to</span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2023/08/17/chesapeake-oks-plan-to-cut-2-early-voting-locations-despite-concerns-about-impact-on-minority-communities/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce its early voting sites</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from seven to five, according to the Daily Press. Democrats noted that both shuttered locations are in majority-Black communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesapeake also discontinued early in-person voting on Sundays, an option popular among some African American churches that mobilize their congregations to go vote after morning worship services.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mcAL3ztJnK"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/15/cost-shouldnt-be-the-main-factor-in-operating-satellite-voting-centers/">Cost shouldn’t be the main factor in operating satellite voting centers</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Youngkin — at least for this year’s election — urges Virginians to avail themselves of greater ballot access, several Republican-ruled states have lurched hard in the opposite direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina just passed legislation that curbs absentee balloting, gives partisan poll watchers new oversight authority at polling places and restricts private funding for elections. While Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is expected to veto the bill, Republicans have the numbers in both that swing state’s House and Senate to override it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sweeping GOP-authored changes in Georgia and Texas law were voided last week by federal judges in those states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Texas, a requirement that mail-in ballots be accompanied by the same identification number a voter used (often decades earlier) to register, was struck down. The number of rejected mail-in ballots soared in Texas after its enactment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Georgia, a judge temporarily set aside a law that punishes people who offer food or water to voters waiting for hours in interminable queues outside polling places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Virginia’s Republican governor is showing leadership in trying to unmoor his party from a baseless and self-defeating paranoia is encouraging. It would be more convincing, however, if he led Republicans on local electoral boards to see that our democracy works best when, as Dunnavant said, “everybody votes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its doors will swing open. The driver will greet the small people and beckon them aboard. The big kids will clamber inside and take their seats. For the smallest, however, it will be a moment of frightful uncertainty. The 5-year-old child’s grasp will tighten on the parental hand; together they approach the bus door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One last glance upward. The child looks for the loving assurance needed to take the singular step that decisively delineates life as it has been from a forever different life ahead. It ends the hazy comfort of daycare or, for some, years spent in the cocoon of home. Counting pre-K, it begins a 13- to 14-year educational journey designed to end someday with a cap and gown, a diploma, hugs, photographs and big smiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet on this morning, tears will gather and spill, even from the wariest of eyes. Grown-ups will try to conceal it from their children — failing more often than not — in hopes that the first day of school will be remembered more as the start of a joyful and fulfilling odyssey than one of the unsettling times the child saw mom or dad cry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s morning on the first day of a new school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world gone awry, our public schools remain the essential bulwark and common bond of our communities and of Virginia broadly. Battered and bruised, the system still works. And it works primarily because of the professionals at the heart of it all: teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works, even with such sobering and unprecedented challenges as Virginia’s dreadful levels of pandemic-related </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/29/four-takeaways-from-virginias-post-pandemic-standardized-test-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning loss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and mass shootings, seemingly at random, across the nation in classrooms filled with children.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="etF2T6bPyM"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/29/four-takeaways-from-virginias-post-pandemic-standardized-test-results/">Four takeaways from Virginia’s post-pandemic standardized test results</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Four takeaways from Virginia’s post-pandemic standardized test results&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/29/four-takeaways-from-virginias-post-pandemic-standardized-test-results/embed/#?secret=h6RzHdZ0Ys#?secret=etF2T6bPyM" data-secret="etF2T6bPyM" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works, even as many teachers — burned out by meager pay, the erosion of their professional discretion and creativity, a slavish institutional fealty to standardized testing, a caustic political environment and ebbing public and administrative support — abandoned the profession in an exodus exacerbated by the pandemic. It created acute shortages in some</span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/state-board-data-funding/data-reports/statistics-reports/interactive-data-dashboards/teacher-school-staffing-vacancy-dashboard" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia districts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works, even as more parents choose alternatives to public schools such as private or religious schools and homeschooling. Projected enrollment in Virginia this fall is down by just over 65,000 students from the fall statewide enrollment of nearly 1.3 million in 2019, according to</span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_203.20.asp" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Center for Educational Statistics data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works because of the teachers, the counselors, the administrators, the school nurses, the bus drivers, the coaches, the custodians — the people who show up every day to provide the instruction, socialization and structure that prepares kids for adulthood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If ever there were a time to dedicate a school year to restoring the luster of teaching and appreciation for teachers, 2023-24 should be it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should do it just because it’s right and it’s a smart investment. Always has been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those parents or guardians or other caregivers who walk their little ones to those school bus stops (or to the front door of the school building itself) during these closing weeks of summer, the contributions of a teacher at some point in life remain very real. Most will recall a special teacher who just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">clicked</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who reached out; who saw a struggle and stepped in to lend encouragement and impart understanding; who saw promise and leaned in to help grow and polish it to its brightest potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve seen stories of</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4135876-back-to-school-sales-boom-as-teachers-dig-into-their-own-pockets-for-classroom-supplies/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">teachers</span></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/us/teachers-school-supplies.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">using</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> personal funds to help supply classroom materials, even though average pay for K-12 faculty in Virginia</span><a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/how-much-do-teachers-get-paid-see-new-state-by-state-data/2023/04" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">trailed the national average</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by more than $6,000 in the 2022-23 school year, according to Education Week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly made some progress toward boosting teacher pay closer to the national average by appropriating a 5% raise for the current fiscal year. It could have been 7% had the General Assembly</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/31/willful-neglect-of-virginias-second-year-budgets-must-not-become-our-new-normal/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bothered to finalize amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the second half of the biennial budget by its June 30 deadline.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Willful neglect of Virginia’s second-year budgets must not become our new normal&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/07/31/willful-neglect-of-virginias-second-year-budgets-must-not-become-our-new-normal/embed/#?secret=PsYwpZiYXy#?secret=fKbYFMdyAx" data-secret="fKbYFMdyAx" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is, however, a more practical and pressing reason to restore our cadre of educators: because we have too few of them now to optimally instruct the children we entrust to their care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to state</span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/state-board-data-funding/data-reports/statistics-reports/interactive-data-dashboards/teacher-school-staffing-vacancy-dashboard" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Education data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the commonwealth was about 3,573 vacancies, or 3.9%, short of its full complement of just over 92,000 teachers last October. That’s up from an average of 870 vacancies from 2015 to 2020, according to a scathing</span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575-3.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the General Assembly’s research and analysis arm, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. In 2021, that number vaulted to about 2,600 and continued climbing, JLARC reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problems driving teachers out of the classrooms, however, aren’t all about pay and they’re not exclusive to Virginia.</span><a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/shortage-of-teachers/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published in December by the Economic Policy Institute found that salary was tied for fourth among reasons teachers bailed. The top reason given (by 43%) of the 958 departing K-12 public school teachers EPI surveyed: “The stress and disappointments of teaching weren’t worth it.” Twenty-four percent cited insufficient pay, just behind “I did not get enough support from my school district” (29%).<iframe loading="lazy" 0 src="https://www.epi.org?p=255717&amp;view=embed&amp;embed_template=charts_v2013_08_21&amp;embed_date=20230801&amp;onp=254745&amp;utm_source=epi_press&amp;utm_medium=chart_embed&amp;utm_campaign=charts_v2" width="100%" height="460" 1="frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&quot;" scrolling="yes" class="iframe-class" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After COVID-19 was deemed sufficiently controlled for classroom instruction to resume, teachers reported a sharp increase in outright insubordination, defiance and threats by students. It reached a horrifying ultimate conclusion when a 6-year-old boy allegedly shot and gravely wounded his first-grade teacher in Newport News with a handgun he smuggled into school from his home,</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/08/us/newport-news-student-shot-teacher-warrant" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">then bragged about it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stress and disrespect don’t end at the classroom door, either. As administrators made greater demands on teachers’ time, support for them ebbed among the public, parents and elected officials as public education became a major wedge issue in the 2021 governor’s race with teachers and curricula caught in the middle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are among the conditions that drove bright young educators like John Reaves, whom I</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/15/subpar-pay-burnout-pandemic-disruptions-and-a-teacher-exodus/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">interviewed a year ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to other professions. Reaves had returned to his alma mater, Henrico County’s Mills E. Godwin High School, to teach English. When schools closed for the summer in 2022, he left the safety of a secure paycheck to become a screenwriter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which returns us to all those poignant first-day-of-school moments now upon us, moments when hope and fear wrestle in the hearts of both the new pupils and their parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">best</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hopes</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for those tender, precious souls who represent the putative senior classes of 2037 or ’38 are inextricably tied to how well Virginia recruits, hires, retains, empowers, monitors and supports their teachers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">worst</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fears</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are that we, as a commonwealth, do the same things for the next dozen or so years that we’ve done for the past four or five.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 15 state legislators responsible for revising the state’s budget for the next year (now just 11 months) were supposed to resolve their few </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/28/what-caused-virginias-budget-breakdown-accounts-differ/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">differences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the state’s master spending blueprint and write it into state law by July 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomorrow’s Aug. 1, and still there’s no agreement, even though there’s a financial cushion of somewhere between $3 billion and $5 billion, depending on whose estimates you accept, waiting to be budgeted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is plenty of partisan posturing and blamestorming between the Republicans, who rule the House of Delegates and the governor’s office, and the Democrats, who hold the Senate, but there’s no discernible initiative on either side to finish the job soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re having too much fun using it as a political football heading into fall’s pivotal off-off-year state legislative elections. Why amend the budget to appropriate money for various needs or to cut taxes when you can spend the next few months damning the other side for a shared failure?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one regard, we’re lucky it’s not a crisis the way it almost was last year. In 2022, they came within days of not having a new-from-scratch budget in place by the midnight witching hour when June becomes July, the old budget expires and a fresh fiscal year begins.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a good spot for some background for people who have real lives and aren’t intimate with the byzantine world of Virginia governmental finance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commonwealth budgets in two-year increments. These biennial budgets take effect every </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">even</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-numbered year. It’s a much bigger deal to miss the June 30 deadline in those years when the underlying budget ends and the state can’t pay its bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">odd</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-numbered year, so the second year of the biennial budget is still in force and the state still has operating money. But things change over the course of a year and budgets need to change with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some needs become acute while others diminish. Markets and prices rise and fall. Consider that this time last year, a gallon of gasoline was pushing $5, but you could still secure a 30-year mortgage at an annual interest rate of about 5% compared to about 7% now. In 2021, mortgages were under 3%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment rates rise and fall, too, guiding the ebbs and flows of the state’s general revenue collections derived largely from taxes withheld from paychecks. Virginia has </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/25/states-see-record-low-unemployment-across-the-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rebounded well</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from disastrously high levels of pandemic-era unemployment, and the state government finds itself flush with cash: Gov. Glenn Youngkin says it’s about $5 billion; Senate Democrats contend it’s likely lower, maybe $3 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budgeting when revenues are billions of dollars short of needs is hard work. Deciding how to divvy up a windfall this large isn’t. There’s no shortage of needful uses. Youngkin and the GOP want to cut taxes. Democrats want it spent on public schools. Either option beats letting it sit idle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most conspicuous and demonstrable need is the serious </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/24/plagued-by-teacher-shortages-some-states-turn-to-fast-track-credentialing/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shortage of public school teachers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the commonwealth struggles to remediate alarming student learning losses, both consequences of the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A provision already in the budget provided school districts with enough money to boost teacher pay by 5%. Stranded within budget revisions that both parties are holding hostage is a bipartisan proposal to increase the teachers’ raise to 7%. Had budget conferees acted with deliberate speed, it would have lent local school administrators a helpful edge in competing for in-demand teachers back in May or June, before their districts had to lock in their 2023-2024 budgets and make employment offers based on them. Pupils in some districts have </span><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/why-richmond-students-returned-school-164823206.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALhnprh5tTDn8iHZHv-_sBbDe-dv-6F1Xh4GLOBk4sGFJI5MO5dwly5JlSeNnDgNekg8dxL5L0E37T-lnTHOG7bV3LkaoOE9PEdlwfIC9EBtE2Fbeb8MgzjLikiacdrL4tknadWRHhV9LEE92ww0PIoGC1Zhx4uuURQR-cZnRryL" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already returned to class</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some school boards did not go with the 7% [raise] because they weren’t confident that [it] would be in the final budget,” said Scott Braband, executive director of the Virginia Association of School Superintendents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just how much Virginia needs the added funding was made clear earlier this month in a study by the General Assembly’s analytical arm, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, which found Virginia </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/10/study-finds-virginia-underfunds-k-12-schools-recommends-spending-billions-more/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly underfunds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its schools.</span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt575.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said school divisions in the commonwealth receive 14% less state aid than the 50-state average. It also prescribed programs needed to bring Virginia’s schools to parity at an estimated cost of about $3.5 billion over several years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet work toward a revised budget still languishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Frankly, this continues to be part of the climate in which teachers are making decisions: ‘Is this (teaching) something I want to get into or something I want to stay in?’” Braband said in an interview last week. “It affects teacher recruitment and retention.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, valid concerns about something as fundamental as the scholastic wellbeing of Virginia’s next generation — a necessity buttressed by data, research and the everyday experiences of students and their parents — don’t register on Capitol Square. Primary elections </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/26/now-if-its-no-trouble-might-we-bother-you-for-a-budget/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushed the responsibility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of finalizing a budget</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/14/norment-says-political-primaries-are-factor-in-virginias-unresolved-budget-impasse/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">off the to-do list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through June.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Now, if it’s no trouble, might we bother you for a budget?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/26/now-if-its-no-trouble-might-we-bother-you-for-a-budget/embed/#?secret=xcAFsMYN35#?secret=mRT91tdQRm" data-secret="mRT91tdQRm" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, retail politics ahead of November’s general election seems to be taking precedence over the people’s business, possibly backing the process into December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The damaging legacy from this is that it further distances Virginia from a time not so long ago when budgeting was taken more seriously, when there was a shared sense of discipline toward completing this central policy task and a palpable sense of shame for failing. The last time there were no odd-year budget amendments was 2001 when Senate Democrats and Republicans together balked at Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore’s demand to advance his car-tax phaseout in a recession with state revenues declining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s to keep future budget conferees from doing nothing? They could shrug it off, remembering that when it happened in 2023, no one took to the streets and hell didn’t freeze when they let billions gather dust while they played politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sort of mindset would be extremely disruptive, particularly for public institutions that need predictable, dependable streams of state resources to provide taxpayers the best public services possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s it,” Braband said. “This kind of budget process cannot become the new normal. Virginia’s better than that. Virginia educators deserve better than that and Virginians deserve better than that.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Country singer Jason Aldean has reaped a whirlwind of big-media scorn for his intemperate new hit titled “Try That in a Small Town.” As he should.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seething tone of the lyrics alone are an unvarnished and bellicose call for vigilantism by “good ol’ boys, raised up right” in towns and crossroads outside America’s cities and suburbs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It widens the troubling geographic and cultural fissure between urban America and its leafy, prosperous bedroom communities and the struggling rural towns that feel they were denied growth and opportunity in recent decades, a split Virginia illustrates well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aldean’s lyrics inventory a litany of violent street-level crimes such as sucker-punching someone on a sidewalk, carjacking senior motorists, robbing a liquor store, desecrating the American flag or cursing and spitting on police. Then this warning:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, try that in a small town</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">See how far ya make it down the road</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Round here, we take care of our own</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You cross that line, it won&#8217;t take long</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">For you to find out, I recommend you don&#8217;t</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try that in a small town.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aldean’s video, however, is far more menacing and malignant. That’s why I’m not linking to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and his band were filmed outside the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee, infamous as the site where a white mob</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/21/arts/music/jason-aldean-song-video-lynching-courthouse-choate.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lynched a Black teenager</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> named Henry Choate in 1927. Accused, without proof, of attacking a 16-year-old white girl, Choate was seized from his jail cell, beaten with a sledgehammer and dragged through Columbia’s streets behind a car before he was hanged from a courthouse balcony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interspersed throughout Aldean’s video is footage of riots and confrontations with police juxtaposed with heartwarming scenes of downhome bonhomie: men hunting ducks, crops being harvested, flags being raised, home movies of backyard football, youth baseball and such. Together, it evokes the sort of unsettling moral dissonance one might experience from watching bits of Ronald Reagan’s hopeful 1984 “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/Zn9fR_-X9uw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning in America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” reelection ad spliced randomly into “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/n2i917l5RFc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Metal Jacket</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In three minutes and nine seconds, the video crystallizes America’s intractable tribalism that threatens the stability of the republic. It manifested itself Jan. 6 2021, when a mob, exhorted by a defeated president, overran the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to subvert an election’s legitimate outcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CMT, the country music cable network,</span><a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=c2aa5d692ee7a522JmltdHM9MTY4OTgxMTIwMCZpZ3VpZD0wNWJjNzdhYy0yNmI4LTZmOTctMmNjNC02NGZkMjc0NTZlNWImaW5zaWQ9NTIxMw&amp;ptn=3&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=05bc77ac-26b8-6f97-2cc4-64fd27456e5b&amp;psq=try+that+in+a+small+town+video&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xOS9hcnRzL211c2ljL2phc29uLWFsZGVhbi10cnktdGhhdC1pbi1hLXNtYWxsLXRvd24tY210Lmh0bWw&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">pulled the tune</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from its lineup. The mayor of Columbia, where the video was shot, told Billboard that he hopes the next video shot in his city will “seek a more positive message.” Rocker Sheryl Crow, who grew up amid the soybean, cotton and corn farms near Kennett in Missouri’s rural Bootheel,</span><a href="https://twitter.com/SherylCrow/status/1681485292425867264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1681485292425867264%7Ctwgr%5E8d2d6730841844b095e4ac9eec368c927f211dd6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stltoday.com%2Flife-entertainment%2Fnation-world%2Fmusic%2Fsheryl-crow-jason-aldean-song-controversy%2Farticle_f052d7bd-4ed4-5477-ae20-73a95809dcb4.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the video is “not American or small town-like. It’s just lame.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scorn, however, will supercharge the song and video in segments of rural America via streaming platforms and small-market radio. It thrives there because of its defiant message to urban and suburban America whose denizens, on average, are more liberal, more affluent, have higher levels of educational attainment and enjoy more stable employment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The imbalance, regardless of its reasons, is real, and Virginia illustrates the disparity well with its suburban/exurban “Golden Crescent” that arcs from Northern Virginia south to the Richmond region, then southeast down the Peninsula to the thriving cities and counties of Hampton Roads. Comparable pockets of prosperity are clustered around major university towns such as Charlottesville, Harrisonburg and Blacksburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Little of the recent development, job creation and population growth those regions enjoyed reached the rural farming, factory and mining communities in Virginia’s fertile Southside and the mountainous Southwest that were the commonwealth’s economic engine for most of the 20th century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global trade deals and U.S. policy decisions during the  past 30 years hastened the decay of many rural areas. International trade agreements made after the Cold War — the</span><a href="https://youtu.be/UpvMVTNSV6I" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">North American Free Trade Agreement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or NAFTA) and China’s admission to the World Trade Organization — sent U.S. manufacturing jobs to cheaper overseas labor markets and helped turn once-bustling textile and furniture factories in cities like Danville and Martinsville into derelict husks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clear and present</span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/summer-of-record-breaking-heat-paints-story-of-a-warming-world-scientists-say" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">climate concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have animated a move toward less-polluting energy sources and</span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48696" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">away from coal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s jarring for state policymakers in Richmond to hear that the vast outlands of Southwest and Southside Virginia are their afterthoughts, but driving through those towns and seeing the bare foundations and blank windows of shuttered factories and storefronts speaks a discomfiting truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research by the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service shows that 18 localities lost one-tenth or more of their population from</span><a href="https://demographics.coopercenter.org/sites/demographics/files/VA-Intercensal-Estimates_2000-2010.xls" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to</span><a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fdemographics.coopercenter.org%2Fsites%2Fdemographics%2Ffiles%2Fmedia%2Ffiles%2F2023-01%2FPopulationEstimates_July2022_VA_CooperCenter_0.xlsx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All of them, except for Accomack County on the Eastern Shore, were in Southside or Southwest Virginia including Buchanan County, which decreased by 28%. Conversely, 60 localities grew by 10% or more, including 44 with a growth rate at or above 20% in the past 22 years. Northern Virginia exurb Loudoun County saw its population balloon by nearly 2 ½ times since the turn of the century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural areas are not without hope. A</span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/328268/country-living-enjoys-renewed-appeal.aspx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 national Gallup survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed that 48% of respondents prefer to live in small towns or rural areas if possible, up from 39% three years earlier. People are indeed moving to the country, particularly since the pandemic, said Cooper Center demographer Hamilton Lombard. Many rural areas have done a good job attracting, he said, but not at a rate that equals or exceeds death rates from the older rural populations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In some rural counties, there are two or even three times more residents in their sixties than in their twenties. For me, the most significant gap that has opened up between rural and urban Virginia has been the age gap,” Lombard said in an email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cooper Center’s</span><a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fdemographics.coopercenter.org%2Fsites%2Fdemographics%2Ffiles%2F2022-06%2FVAPopProjections_Total_2030-2050.xls&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">projections for future growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggest the gap will widen. By 2050, the populations of 14 rural counties — again, all in Southside or Southwest Virginia — will drop by one-fifth or more, with Buchanan projected to hemorrhage by 51%. At the same time, 37 localities are projected to increase by 20% or more, with Loudoun expected to increase by 77%. Only one — the Richmond exurb of Powhatan County — could be marginally construed as being in Southside Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That, along with seeing their small-town folkways and mores mocked in pop culture, makes some rural audiences receptive to hustlers exploiting grievance for their own gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s only so long that the have-nots can watch the haves enjoy the growth and prosperity they’ve missed before disappointment ossifies into overt hostility. Sadly, as Aldean cynically proves, there’s more money to be made from widening that chasm than from bridging it.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters after a Veteran's Day event in Richmond in Nov. 2022. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who could begrudge giving grants to families of children whose schooling was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic as a way to help those students catch up on learning lost in those dark days of shuttered classrooms and instruction via Zoom?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin sensed the need and he ultimately put $60 million that was allocated to Virginia as part of the federal pandemic relief package into “learning acceleration grants.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A win-win proposition, right? It wasn’t state tax money in play but a federal windfall. And its need was clear after a national assessment done post-pandemic showed Virginia had the sharpest drop of any state in reading scores among fourth graders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, giving moms and dads money to help the kids jump-start their interrupted educations is a savvy follow-up for a Republican governor who came out of political oblivion and leveraged the issue of parental involvement in their children’s schools to upset a well-funded Democratic former governor. Besides, it’s good campaign fodder should Youngkin seek higher office sometime soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All went swimmingly for a few months after Youngkin</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/09/youngkin-announces-new-slate-of-efforts-to-address-learning-loss-in-virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">announced the program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March. Virginia parents found out about the grants and applied. Then, in the span of just a few news cycles this month, it all slouched southward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A journalist at Richmond’s WTVR-TV caught wind of parents distressed that their repeated efforts to secure the grants to underwrite tutoring for their kids were being</span><a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=47fa5e3e89e3d818JmltdHM9MTY4OTAzMzYwMCZpZ3VpZD0xYzI1NGM4MC03NzZhLTY5MDUtMzJlOS01ZTYzNzYyNTY4OTkmaW5zaWQ9NTIyOQ&amp;ptn=3&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=1c254c80-776a-6905-32e9-5e6376256899&amp;psq=youngkin+learning+loss+recovery+grants+wtvr&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3R2ci5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL3ZpcmdpbmlhLWxlYXJuaW5nLWdyYW50cy11cGRhdGVzLWp1bHktNTIwMjM&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">repeatedly rejected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then the station followed up with an educator who explained</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/virginia-tutor-explains-why-she-pulled-out-of-youngkins-learning-grant-program-july-7-2023" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">why she bailed on the program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after signing on as a tutor, calling it “a disaster” and “a hot mess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one asked for lesson plans, the tutor  told WTVR. There was no  agreement on her compensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I could teach a ‘SpongeBob SquarePants’ drawing class,” the educator said, noting that she twice emailed the Virginia Department of Education asking if her class plans met expectations necessary to receive reimbursement and got no reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turns out, the program the administration rushed into place didn’t comply with state and federal laws that require payments to be made on a reimbursement basis, something the state superintendent of education didn’t notify grant recipients of until June 28. In other words, to draw down the grants, parents had to pay for the tutoring up front and then submit receipts to get reimbursed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-grants-higher-income-homes/article_31c2b39a-1c25-11ee-82d3-9fdd2142d18c.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Times-Dispatch reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that low-income households whose students suffered most from pandemic learning loss comprised fewer than one-fourth of the applicants. Of the nearly 35,000 students approved for the grants, the newspaper reported,  just under 8,250 were from families with incomes below the threshold of three times the federal poverty limit, each of whom qualify for $3,000 grants. But almost 26,500 exceeded the economic means metric, making them eligible for grants of $1,500 each.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked about the program’s varied dysfunctions last week,</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/governor-responds-state-learning-grant-issues-july-6-2023" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin rightly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stressed the need for the grants, noted that changes had been put in place to make the program compliant, but then dismissed the problems as affecting only “a handful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s not impugn Youngkin’s motives; I suspect they were good. I think he saw a real need, and believed he had an easy solution with the means and opportunity to make it happen. But this is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">government,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where nothing’s ever as easy or straightforward as it might appear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seemed like a good idea at the time” is a common benediction that gubernatorial administrations apply — always after the fact — to well-intended initiatives that become punch lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was that time Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine closed rest areas along Virginia interstate highways when he was upset at Republican lawmakers’ budget cuts to human services in the depths of a brutal recession in 2009. It did nothing to restore the lost funding, but it irked motorists and earned him unflattering national press coverage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every governor has had bad-idea days. Youngkin’s predecessor, Democrat Ralph Northam, had several: one was when his administration seemed asleep at the switch as the Parole Board released convicted killers without notifying members of a victim’s family; another featured his inaction as the Virginia Employment Commission froze when it was flooded with pandemic-related claims for unemployment benefits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system in Virginia is not kind to governors, who have a tight and rushed learning curve because ours is the only state that denies chief executives the opportunity for reelection. By the time they figure it out, moving vans are backing up to the Executive Mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s particularly true of governors with zero public-sector experience who arrive with too much hubris and too little knowledge, like Youngkin, or another one of his predecessors from the world of venture capital, Mark Warner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner had enough involvement in Democratic politics — he managed L. Douglas Wilder’s successful 1989 gubernatorial campaign — to appreciate his limitations. So he made Bill Leighty, a wily Capitol Square yeoman who has forgotten more intricate detail about how state government works than most people will ever know, his chief of staff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that Warner didn’t stumble. For two years, he salved welts a Republican General Assembly dealt him before learning how to play their cutthroat game and push his signature tax reform bill through an overwhelmingly Republican legislature in 2004.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner’s inherent cautiousness yoked to Leighty’s encyclopedic knowledge and meticulous preparation averted many avoidable migraines that afflict governors who shoot from the hip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a front-row seat to watch Leighty deftly navigate through Rube Goldberg regulations, obscure statutes and bureaucratic tripwires like those Youngkin’s staff triggered in the learning recovery grants rollout. He unpacks a lot more that the press never knew about in his autobiographical “Capitol Secrets: Leadership Wisdom from a Lifetime of Public Service,” published earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now retired, Leighty regales friends with his war stories, but the abiding moral is that governing goes better when governors and their minions talk less and listen more, particularly to those who’ve done the work. He calls them the “gray-hairs and the no-hairs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also recommends engaging mid- and low-level workers who anonymously pull the agency levers that put policy into action year-in and year-out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I call them the B-team,” he told me last week. “They [will] </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here when governors arrive and they [will] </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here when they leave.”</span></p>

Hopefully, litigation will yield better results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Associated Press</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/voting-rights-felony-convictions-lawsuit-af720e316859e25b2e99ab8e69ee4af9" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reported Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the lawsuit, brought by the ACLU of Virginia and the nonprofit voting rights group Protect Democracy, alleges that Virginia’s current restoration-of-rights regimen violates a Reconstruction-era law Congress passed setting terms for readmitting Virginia to the Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/an-act-to-admit-the-state-of-virginia-to-representation-in-the-congress-of-the-united-states-january-26-1870/" target="_blank">1870 Readmissions Act</a>, signed by President Ulysses Grant, bars the commonwealth from disenfranchising people other than those who were convicted of “common law” felonies during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. Among those serious crimes were murder, arson, rape, robbery, manslaughter and larceny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the AP reported, Virginia expanded its list of felonies that carry automatic lifetime loss of voting rights, including drug offenses. And that is the root of so much of the current system’s inequity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t an argument against prosecuting those who traffic in drugs that are increasingly ubiquitous and dangerous, particularly fentanyl and the prescription opiates that have devastated massive swaths of Appalachia. If anything, efforts to interdict those drugs and punish those who distribute them should redouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, as the bromide goes, the punishment should fit the crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An 18-year-old drug runner who was convicted as a felon faces lifetime disenfranchisement in Virginia even after he has returned to society as a productive, tax-paying citizen. That’s a punishment indistinguishable from a convicted drug cartel captain. And it comes at a dismaying, racially disparate cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black people comprise just</span><a href="https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/interactive/racial-and-ethnic-diversity-in-the-united-states-2010-and-2020-census.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">18.3%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Virginia’s slightly more than 8.6 million residents. Yet they account for almost half of the 312,000 Virginians — the fifth-largest number of any state — who can’t vote because of a felony conviction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, however, is not alone. According to the FBI’s most recent</span><a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/nibrs/2019/tables/pdfs/arrestees_race_by_arrest_offense_category_2019.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Uniform Crime Report in 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Black people accounted for 32% of arrests for crimes against persons, including assault, homicide, kidnapping and human trafficking, 30% of property crime arrests (including 57% of robbery arrests, 41% of embezzlement arrests and 37% of stolen property arrests), and 28% of “crimes against society” including 26% of drug offense arrests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black people are imprisoned at five times the rate of whites, meaning that one out of every 81 Black adults in the United States is incarcerated, according to</span><a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/policy-brief/shadow-report-to-the-united-nations-on-racial-disparities-in-sentencing-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2022 analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit criminal-justice reform research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C., and the ACLU.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A state</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+SJ272" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would restore felons’ voting rights was enacted by a Democratic-controlled General Assembly in 2021 and signed by then-Gov. Ralph Northam, also a Democrat. But to make it to a statewide ballot for voter ratification, constitutional amendments must pass </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">twice</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a legislative election in between. Republicans won control of the House of Delegates and the governor’s office in the 2021 election, and the bill was</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SJ1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">left to die in a House committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three governors of both parties — Republican Bob McDonnell and Democrats Terry McAuliffe and Northam — all significantly boosted the number of felons whose voting rights were restored. In March, Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced that he was</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/06/us/virginia-youngkin-voting-former-felons.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ending his predecessors’ policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of automatically granting voting rights restoration for felons who’ve completed their sentences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Societal and racial dynamics notwithstanding, it’s an unfair, feudal arrangement that’s out of step with the majority of states. Virginia is</span><a href="https://test.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/felon-voting-rights" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">one of 11 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the most restrictive processes for restoring felons who’ve paid their due to full citizenship, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where’s the incentive to reform and rehabilitate, if the hope for regaining one’s dignity resides solely in groveling to the governor and beseeching his favor?

(Sarah Vogelsong/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Virginia finished its party primary elections last Tuesday night and locked in full slates of Democratic and Republican nominees for November’s pivotal legislative elections, just nine days and a wakeup remained to pass a budget until a new fiscal year begins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The procrastination and related dysfunctions the belated budget causes, particularly for local school districts, was the result of retail politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least that’s</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/14/norment-says-political-primaries-are-factor-in-virginias-unresolved-budget-impasse/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the conclusion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> drawn a few weeks earlier by Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment, R-Williamsburg, now retiring and at last able to speak freely after 32 years in the Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that the impasse on the budget has been more because of primaries, political considerations,” Norment told the Mercury’s Graham Moomaw in a June 13 interview. “And that some of the leaders have been distracted.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I reckon so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. George Barker, D-Alexandria was a lead member of the conference committee from the Democratic-controlled Senate tasked with negotiating a compromise with conferees from the Republican-ruled House over differences in their two versions of the budget. He was waging a difficult primary battle in the 36th Senate District to Fairfax County School Board member Stella Pekarsky. Barker lost by 662 votes out of nearly 15,000 cast, closing his Senate career after four terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other top Senate budget negotiator, Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax County, is retiring after 32 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the interest of balance, this year’s primaries were extraordinary in several aspects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nomination battles come at a time of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/07/updated-who-might-and-who-wont-be-returning-to-the-general-assembly-next-year/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unprecedented retirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prompted largely by the state’s first experiment in nonpartisan reapportionment in 2021 that showed </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/16/how-redistricting-reform-is-launching-the-virginia-general-assembly-into-a-new-era/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no regard for incumbents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s particularly true in the Senate where 10 retirements (five from each party) accounted for the loss of slightly more than 230 years of combined tenure (more if you toss in prior service in the House of Delegates).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to the Senate’s already staggering attrition of institutional memory, 11 sitting senators representing just over a century of aggregate experience — 10 of them Democrats accounting for 96 of those years — faced primary opponents. Five of the 11 — Democrats Barker, Chap Petersen of Fairfax, Joe Morrissey of Richmond and Lionel Spruill of Chesapeake, and Republican Amanda Chase of Chesterfield — lost. That cost the Democrats 44 years of Senate tenure compared to just eight for the GOP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then consider the enormous stakes the primaries play in this year’s pivotal races for all 140 General Assembly seats. The Democrats control the 40-member Senate by two seats with Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Sears holding the deciding vote any time there’s a 20/20 split. Republicans control the House and the executive branch, with Gov. Glenn Youngkin leading a determined and richly financed campaign to win the Senate and, with it, total GOP control of state government for the first time since 2013.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, this year’s primary fell quite late. Usually they are within the first couple of Tuesdays in June. By falling on the 20th this year, House and Senate budget negotiators face a nearly impossible timeline for shaking off post-primary hangovers, shaking hands on a budget compromise, summoning the full House and Senate back to Richmond to pass it, sending it to Youngkin for his amendments and vetoes, and then having the full House and Senate return to the Capitol to vote on any changes the governor makes. Accomplishing all of that by the first tick-tock of July would be a feat worthy of a Homeric epic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admittedly, this year’s primary season packed in a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the budget is a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">whole </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lot</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the most important single piece of legislation the General Assembly enacts every year — so important that the budget bill’s provisions override statutory state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tardiness is not new. In 2022, the Legislature dawdled and bickered until June 9 before passing the budget conference report. Youngkin signed it into law on June 22, eight days before the existing budget would have expired and left the commonwealth unable to pay its bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things aren’t as dire this year. Preliminary appropriations for state fiscal year 2024 are included in the two-year budget passed a year ago, so in the likelihood that lawmakers blow past their June 30 deadline, state government finances won’t reset to zero. But in Virginia, amendments are necessary in odd-numbered years to adjust for multiple eventualities in the second half of the biennium, including changes in state policy and spending priorities or, in bad economic times, to address revenue shortfalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they prepared to adjourn in February, lawmakers did pass a so-called “skinny budget” that, among other things, covered a $250 million shortfall for public schools caused by a faulty data tool the state uses to calculate education funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Budget differences so far have largely revolved around the Senate’s demand for an additional $1 billion for K-12 public schools and the insistence by the governor and the House on tax cuts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominant among items left in limbo is how much local school districts can offer their teachers for the coming school year. Under the budget already in place, Virginia teachers are getting a 5% raise in the coming school year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the state under competitive pressure to boost average teacher pay to the national average, the </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/bill/2023/1/HB1400/Chapter/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/bill/2023/1/SB800/Introduced/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> versions of the budget include an additional 2% raise for 2024. But until the budget becomes law (or very close to it), school districts remain on hold, not knowing whether they can sweeten pay packages and retain teachers who now find themselves in great demand because of nationwide teacher shortages exacerbated by the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So shouldn’t the budget enjoy a somewhat higher priority?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shouldn’t lawmakers with essential roles in advancing the budget toward a timely enactment be a bit more mindful of the well-being of the state government and the Virginians that it supports than of their own reelection?</span></p>

Some vowed to pardon Trump if they win the presidency. Lake implied armed domestic conflict could result.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s beyond disappointing for a governor who ran and won two years ago as a sunny, hopeful and pragmatic Republican </span><a href="https://youtu.be/W_x1seKBM9I" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the mold of Ronald Reagan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, calmly brushing aside shrill Democratic assertions that Youngkin was a closet Trumper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, we’re left to wonder: Were the Democrats on to something?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still new to the political game, Youngkin may nurture the delusion that he can have his cake and eat it, too. He’s level-headed Uncle Glenn in zip-up vests bearing his campaign logo and talking up</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/12/youngkin-gets-it-right-in-stripping-degree-preferences-from-most-state-job-postings/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">commonsense reforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one moment. Then he’s  cynically titillating GOP hardliners with discredited tropes about a “two-tiered justice system” afflicting a filthy-rich ex-president and, in some mystifying corollary, parents of public school pupils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of it: the loudest elements of the “law-and-order” party now falsely assert that justice on a national scale is a tool of deep-state leftists intent on persecuting conservatives, all because a former president with a record of</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">gratuitous, habitual lying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is held to account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their attacks are bereft of substance, predicated mostly on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what-aboutism</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “What about President Joe Biden, who was found to have unsecured classified documents in his Delaware home dating to his vice presidency?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference so far is there is no suggestion Biden tried to hide and lie about the documents to the National Archives or to a grand jury, as Trump is alleged to have done repeatedly. And if the Biden classified documents investigation by special counsel Robert Hur finds incriminating evidence against the president, I am confident that he, too, will be (and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be) charged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republicans have refused to go along with the orchestrated gaslighting, including former governors and now Trump primary rivals</span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4046308-haley-says-trump-incredibly-reckless-if-charges-in-indictment-are-true/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Nikki Haley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of South Carolina, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/agYgBHbeRBw?t=22" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asa Hutchinson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Arkansas and</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/us/politics/chris-christie-trump-indictment.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Christie</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of New Jersey as well as Trump’s own attorney general,</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/anafaguy/2023/06/11/former-ag-barr-shocked-by-trump-document-charges-if-even-half-of-it-is-true-hes-toast/?sh=3bb54e0582d3" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Barr</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, who took himself out of the presidential race recently, said in an interview: “I’m actually surprised the other candidates running against him for president are not more aggressive about calling [it] out for what it is. It’s a huge problem — and mostly, it’s a huge problem for the Republican Party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also could have also followed the more discreet example of other GOP leaders such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky or Minority Whip John Thune of South Dakota and just kept silent on Trump’s indictment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an especially dumb tweet in Virginia, where Trump lost both presidential bids and where voters punished Republicans who sought statewide office throughout Trump’s candidacy and his White House years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, I and many others hoped Youngkin’s victory was a template for a new, better and more honorable post-Trump GOP. The governor unraveled that Friday morning in just 73 words.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin delivers the State of the Commonwealth to the Virginia General Assembly Jan. 11, 2023. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mama would approve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So would millions of others </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">who are among</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the smartest, most experienced, best-qualified people who never got the job of their dreams because they never got a college degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin did the good and right thing recently when he </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/05/30/youngkin-college-degree-state-workforce/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">waived the requirement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or at least a prevailing bias favoring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> college degrees for tens of thousands of Virginia state government jobs. It was not only a long-overdue break for people who’ve had to hustle harder to get ahead, it was a smart, early recognition of and accommodation for the workforce of the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administrative policy change that takes effect July 1 means that for 90% of the classified job openings that state agencies advertise, bachelor’s or graduate-level college degrees will no longer be required, nor will holders of those degrees enjoy a head start in vying for those jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting aside the egalitarian appeal of the governor’s action, it comes partly in response to a shortage of available labor, a lingering consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Scrapping the degree requirement will automatically boost applicant pools, perhaps significantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we grew up, we had five people applying for every two jobs,” said Virginia Labor Secretary Bryan Slater. “Now, it’s more like there are two people for every five jobs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The focus now is going to be on looking for work experience, skills and training,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia becomes the eighth state to adopt such a policy in hiring for government jobs. It began in Maryland a year ago when former Gov. Larry Hogan, like Youngkin a Republican, put it in place. Six other states followed suit before Youngkin, with political ambitions beyond Capitol Square, made the announcement late last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The change doesn’t ban degreed applicants from being hired. Agency hiring managers aren’t being told to blackball those with sheepskins and reflexively side with those high school graduates, Slater said. They will have the discretion to pick someone, for instance, with five years’ relevant employment experience, good references and a key certification or two over someone with no work experience but a degree from good ol’ State U.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact is that the most coveted qualifications in today’s job market </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly dominated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by information technology are disciplines that traditional colleges and universities rarely satisfy. If it’s a good starting salary and advancement options you want these days, your best bet is certifications in online networking, coding, cybersecurity and IT systems management. Plumbers and electricians certified by vocational and technical schools do well for themselves, too, while liberal arts majors too often wind up moving in with mom and dad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Virginia Department of Human Resources Management, about 57,000 of Virginia’s approximately 100,000 state employees are “classified.” Youngkin’s change applies to all but about 5,700, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or one-tenth, of those</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> classified employees whose positions are in regulated occupations or professions such as law, accounting and engineering that require degrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few critics complain that Youngkin’s action is “anti-higher education,” but that argument finds little sympathy as more of the country’s college-bound future workforce questions the value of a four-year degree that burdens them with staggering debt as they struggle to find full-time employment in their major field of study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mom was the salutatorian of her high school graduating class. She was scary smart </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">but never went to college</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She read books faster than some folks finished a pack of cigarettes, and had remarkable recall of the material. She could step in as a substitute teacher and know more about the subject matter than some of the degreed educators she supported. In her later years, she found her passion as a literacy volunteer, tutoring elementary school pupils the farthest behind their grade level in reading and, when she was done, had them reading on par with or better than their classmates, keeping </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">alive </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">their dreams of ending generational illiteracy and poverty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College degrees have become boilerplate in most every job posting, but that wasn’t always true. My wife is a good example. In her late twenties, she became the first woman vice president of a major Texas-based data processing company after she applied for a job requiring two years of data processing experience </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">or</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a computer science degree. Now, she would be excluded from consideration even for the positions of those she hired, fired, trained and managed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was the first in my family to get a college degree </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a bachelor’s degree in journalism </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I am proud of it. My classmates included future Pulitzer Prize winners. But I learned early on that the most essential lessons needn’t come from textbooks or lectures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was interviewing for my first job as editor of a small Mississippi Delta weekly. The paper’s owner asked me what the most important job of a newspaper was. Brimming with a headful of lofty academic folderal that came with my new degree, I expounded on the “social responsibility” model in which the press assumes the duty of elevating matters of public import to the level of community discussion and debate.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wham!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The late John Emmerich, a legendary newspaperman raised in a venerated Mississippi newspapering family, slammed his palm on his desk and cut me off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, damn it! The first job of a newspaper is to make money! You can’t do any of those things if you can’t make money!” he said, delivering in seven seconds a lesson more foundational than any I had learned the prior four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I left the interview shaken but I got the job, maybe </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in spite</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> my degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changing employment culture of the world, not just the United States, will reward the nimble who best leverage their experience and adapt fastest to markets that literally move at electric speed. Employers are recognizing that people with those skills shouldn’t go to the back of the line behind degree holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good on you, Governor Youngkin, for doing something about it sooner than most.</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t have to hear it from Moody’s Analytics last week to know that Virginia could be hit hard if Congress fails to raise the federal government’s borrowing limit and the United States defaults on its debts for the first time. I met with my financial planner over that very concern last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellin on down have warned for months that if the government of the planet’s largest economy becomes history’s largest deadbeat by early June, an economic tsunami that begins here could soon plunge other nations into a recession, or perhaps</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/07/economy/debt-default-warning-moodys/index.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">worse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moody’s — among the world’s best-known and most trusted credit-rating institutions with its top-of-the-game tools and global reach and perspective — put real research and data behind a</span><a href="https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2023/debt-limit-scenario-update.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">list of the states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would suffer without a deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States closest to Washington and the federal government, logically, have much skin in the game. Virginia and Maryland fit that profile financially, geographically and socially.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="https://rockinst.org/issue-areas/fiscal-analysis/balance-of-payments-portal/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">research by the Rockefeller Institute of Governmen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">t, Virginia receives more federal money than any state by a long shot ($32.5 billion in 2021, counting COVID relief benefits, compared to second place Alaska at $29 billion and Maryland in third place at $27.6 billion).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What separates the commonwealth from the pack is federal contracts ($13.6 billion, dwarfing runner-up Kentucky at $7.6 billion and third-place Maryland’s $7.3 billion). The rest of Virginia’s federal windfall includes nearly $9.5 billion in direct payments, $2.1 billion in grants, $3 billion in wages and $4.2 billion in COVID relief payments in 2021, the latest year for which Rockefeller Institute data are available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put another way, compared to the $12.4 billion in total taxes Uncle Sam collected from Virginia businesses and residents two years ago, the state got back $20 billion more than it paid, or $2.62 for every dollar Virginia sent across the Potomac, the Rockefeller Institute analysis shows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can see the adversity ahead for Virginia if Democratic President Joe Biden can’t reach an agreement with the Republican House of Representatives and Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the next couple of weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s especially true north of the Occoquan River, an area which teems with federally supported employees and government and defense contractors. The same is true forHampton Roads, home to the world’s largest U.S. Navy base and active duty and retired military.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House has adopted a bill that</span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whats-us-house-republicans-debt-ceiling-spending-cut-bill-2023-04-27/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">slashes federal programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a prerequisite for increasing the government’s maxed-out $31.4 trillion borrowing limit; it only kicks the can down the road another 10 months, or $1.5 trillion, meaning we will repeat this soap opera next March. The House’s cuts include: repealing incentives for renewable, clean energy projects and electric vehicles; easing regulations on carbon energy sources such as oil and gas; revoking funding to update antiquated IRS technology and hire more agents to track down tax cheats; increasing work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP benefit recipients; and giving Congress unprecedented authority to review new executive branch rules and regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are nonstarters for Biden and the Democratic Senate. They note that the debt limit increase is necessary to cover </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">past</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bills the government already owes and that the House-controlled appropriations process is where </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">future</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cuts must be addressed. For you or me, it’s like refusing to pay </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">last</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> month’s credit card bill because you want to replace your dishwasher </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">next</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twice during Donald Trump’s presidency, congressional Republicans raised no objection to boosting the line of credit twice over four years when the</span><a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2021/10/trumps-final-numbers/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">federal debt ballooned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from $14.4 trillion to $21.6 trillion, a 50% increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, there are hardline GOP voices in the House willing to cede no ground in talks with Biden even if the process collapses, possibly draining your 401(k) plans, veterans benefits, Social Security checks and Medicaid coverage, to name a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the loudest voices exhorting McCarthy to stonewall against compromise and insist on the House cuts is Rep. Bob Good, R-Va.. In a</span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c743182f-a391-407d-bd91-43d40c7cd656?shareType=nongift" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recent Financial Times interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Good said, “The Senate needs to pass it and the president needs to sign it, because if they don’t, they are risking whatever consequence that comes from not doing so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was also quoted as saying, “There’s really not the catastrophic consequence that many  … would have us believe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good’s sophistry shows why this avoidable debacle becomes more likely by the day. In the most callous, cynical political environment in modern history where parties slavishly heed their hardliners, there is a belief that the coming derecho can be spun to one party’s advantage at the other’s expense, no matter how many get hurt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be sure, future spending is not sustainable at current growth rates relative to revenue and it has to be addressed. But a contrived debt default would be destructive malfeasance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With so much at stake, it’s time for Virginia voters to start working their phones and email their social and professional networks to demand that leaders lead. It’s time for the silent majority at last to make signs, to peacefully demonstrate, to pen op-eds, to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">raise hell</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to make their elected representatives grasp that failure is not an option.</span></p>

In the past couple of weeks, Virginia’s most powerful Republicans have joined the parade by pandering in a legislative election year to the GOP’s white, anti-DEI base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the state’s chief diversity officer, Martin D. Brown, told a gathering of faculty and staff at Virginia Military Institute — a school riven recently by allegations of racism, sexism and resistance to diversity and inclusion  — that diversity is the “wrong mission” and is “dead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The comments, as</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/04/27/vmi-dei-equity-/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">first reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by The Washington Post, are stunning considering that Brown is specifically tasked under</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title2.2/chapter4.2:2/section2.2-435.12/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a 2020 law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to advance diverse, equitable and inclusive policies throughout state government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine the superintendent of the Virginia State police telling motorists, “Feel free to disregard the speed limit, we’re not going to stop you!” Brown and Youngkin, who hired Brown in November, have a legal duty to faithfully execute Virginia’s laws. Brown conceded as much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re not going to bring that cow up anymore. It’s dead. It was mandated by the General Assembly, but this governor has a different philosophy of civil discourse, civility, treating — living the golden rule, right?” the Post, citing a recording of the event last month, quoted Brown as saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown may not like the work he’s paid to do. If he and the governor can bring a majority in both chambers of the General Assembly around to their point of view, the law can be changed through the due process of representative democracy. That’s one of the things November’s election is about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until that happens, Youngkin could (and should) command Brown to do the work of the commonwealth’s chief diversity officer rather than undermining it. Or he could fire him, as many have implored him to do. Among them is Youngkin’s predecessor, former</span><a href="https://twitter.com/GovernorWilder/status/1653483703174144001" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. L. Douglas Wilder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, America’s first elected Black governor and a Democrat who had previously been a vocal supporter of Youngkin’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, instead, is siding with Brown and traveling the state articulating his consistent position against DEI programs, saying he supports equal opportunity but not “equal outcomes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked for elaboration, Youngkin’s press secretary, Macaulay Porter, referred to remarks the governor made in</span><a href="https://milkeninstitute.org/panel/14510/governing-america-conversation-virginia-governor-glenn-youngkin" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a streamed interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Milken Institute shortly after Brown’s comments at VMI. (Go to the 14:50 mark.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These concepts — five, seven, 10 years ago — were laudable. It was about creating inclusive environments where people felt like &#8230; they had access and could be engaged. It was about making sure that we understood that diversity of thought, which comes from diversity of life experience, results in better outcomes, and all the academic data points to this. What we&#8217;ve seen, of course, is that this has gone in a very, very excessive area where all of a sudden, the idea that we should compromise excellence, we should compromise merit, in pursuit of a goal for equal outcomes is the real challenge. And we see it manifested in real decisions,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then last week, the Republican leaders of Virginia’s House of Delegates picked up the baton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, and Majority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott,</span><a href="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/72/0728e478-eab2-11ed-aac4-df5a887f7304/645407aa56d57.pdf.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">asked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the General Assembly’s investigative arm, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, to study how non-instructional administrative staff, “particularly Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) positions,” contribute to rising costs of college education in Virginia. The development was</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/house-republicans-ask-state-to-study-higher-ed-costs-dei-positions/article_30234176-eaac-11ed-86be-0345041860aa.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">first reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Friday by the Richmond Times-Dispatch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One such report stated that approximately 1,100 in-state students could receive a full-tuition scholarship for the amount spent on DEI salaries,” Gilbert and Kilgore wrote to JLARC executive director Hal Greer. They were citing a Virginia Association of Scholars</span><a href="https://www.virginiascholars.org/s/VAAS-DEI-Report-V2-xww6.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> titled “Should Virginians Pay for University ‘Diversity’ Leftism? ‘Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion’ and Leftist Ideology at Virginia Universities.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican Party has become a refuge for seething white antipathy toward anything that calls out the wrongs done for hundreds of years to generations of African Americans and other Americans of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern GOP has been clear in its unambiguous appeal to aggrieved and frightened white, straight men for a long time. But until recently, the party — not all Republicans, but a significant and noisy element — avoided making it as harshly clear as it has</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/summer-digital-protest-how-2020-became-summer-activism-both-online-n1241001" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">since 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At times, it plays out like a contest to see who among them can most forcefully plant a flag in a pre-1954 Jim Crow America and drag the rest of the country back there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Tennessee, the state’s Republican-led House of Representatives undertook the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/a-heartbreaking-spectacle-in-my-native-tennessee-made-me-appreciate-virginia-all-the-more/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">self-defeating act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of expelling two Black members who, along with a white colleague, disrupted House proceedings to protest the state’s liberal gun rights laws after six people were shot dead at a private school a few miles from the state Capitol. The white representative survived her expulsion attempt by one vote, something</span><a href="https://cdn.jwplayer.com/previews/Bf4vH7jA" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">she attributed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to her skin color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican-ruled states, especially in the South, have effectively canceled any public school history curricula that provide a frank accounting of their states’ and the nation’s shameful history of slavery and the institutionalized discrimination that endured long after</span><a href="https://www.history.com/topics/american-civil-war/appomattox-court-house" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Appomattox Court House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the</span><a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/13th-amendment#:~:text=The%2013th%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution%20provides%20that,place%20subject%20to%20their%20jurisdiction.%22" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">13th Amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Texas, Republican Gov. Gregg Abbott provided a telling insight about his regard for “the others” recently when he referred to five members of a Honduran family, including women and children, allegedly slain by a neighbor with an assault-style rifle last week as “illegal aliens.” The governor’s mouthpieces have since</span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/critics-accuse-abbott-dehumanize-texas-mass-shooting-victims/story?id=98982615" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">attempted damage control</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but his</span><a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1652783731290013696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1652783731290013696%7Ctwgr%5Ea1e7668e71c7bec745c65c002ea716ce44a2b372%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fiframe.nbcnews.com%2FCJ7Kl2d%3F_showcaption%3Dtrueapp%3D1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">callous tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> endures in infamy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diversity initiatives exist because injustice indisputably existed and continues. Those initiatives, like all government endeavors, are imperfect, but where abuses exist, address them — legislatively, if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But defying existing law and taking a sledgehammer to DEI to leverage white grievance in an election year is reprehensible and risks leaving the party that brought about the emancipation of enslaved Americans mired on the wrong side of modern history.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My eye was drawn to a short story in the Virginia Mercury last week about the commonwealth’s senior U.S. senator, Mark Warner, supporting a resolution that endorses the need for robust, independent local news organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/warner-backs-resolution-declaring-local-news-as-essential-to-democracy/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">338-word piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Meghan McIntyre was rich with alarming statistics about brutal declines local news organizations have suffered from interconnected societal, technological and financial challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the second paragraph was Warner’s money quote: that local news outlets “keep our citizens informed, combat disinformation, and serve as a crucial check on our government institutions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never been truer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing newspapers and broadcast outlets that once stood as titans of journalism now nearly enfeebled to the industry equivalent of hospice care is wrenching, as is the human toll paid by excellent journalists I have known who were discarded as collateral damage. In rural areas particularly, there are “</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/06/29/news-deserts-newspapers-democracy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news deserts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” where access to original, local, independent public affairs reporting has essentially vanished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is an overdue urgency now about the task of combating disinformation and holding the government to account that I’ve never seen and that I could not have dreamed possible just 10 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the globe, including the United States, cynical disregard for democratic norms and naked appeals to authoritarianism are on the rise and gaining momentum. Emboldened by an atrophied news media’s inability to adequately sound the alarm, antidemocratic movements and the aspiring despots who lead them are undermining other institutions vital to the preservation of democracy, especially the courts, law enforcement and those who count the votes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/13/voting-officials-resignation-amid-outlandish-accusations-an-ominous-sign-for-democracy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electoral boards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democracy is not a birthright. It has to be earned, over and over, generation by generation. At a minimum, it is inextricably tied to a civil society’s willingness to engage in the duty of informed self-governance, work made more difficult by the demise of local newsgathering and the concurrent rise of malignant, deliberate and choreographed disinformation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner is not a casual observer of these trends. As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he has arguably the nation’s best perspective from which to judge the origins, intent and effect of these hostile efforts, both foreign and domestic, to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/20/technology/disinformation-spread.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mislead and manipulate Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without reputable, accountable local news sources, Warner said, people turn to web-based services, most of which provide no local or regional coverage, and there is “a huge opportunity for disinformation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://www.state.gov/disarming-disinformation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Russians</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the other day were bragging about the fact that the Americans had discovered only about 1% of their bots that are either creating fake content or amplifying fake content,” he said Thursday. “Oftentimes what you see is some crazy story with no relationship to the truth that then moves to the top of your news feed because there may be fake entities promoting it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a good working rapport with Warner as governor, though our roles </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his as governor, mine as a reporter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sometimes put us at odds. New to elective office, he would prowl news websites late into the night, aides would later confide, sometimes waking press office staffers with instructions to call a reporter over a story he felt got it wrong. Yet he afforded me and other journalists extraordinary access during his time on Capitol Square. I respected that about him then and I still do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner called me from the campaign trail one night in 2001 to voice displeasure over a profile I had written of his Republican gubernatorial election opponent, saying I’d been  too charitable. He used blue language to make his point, none of it off the record. His campaign press secretary, Mo Elleithee, found out and called me to attempt damage control. I told him that I didn’t consider chewing out a reporter newsworthy. I suggested that Mo </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now the founding director of Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tell Warner to expect a damaging story, let him twist in the wind overnight fearing the worst, then inform his sleepless boss the next morning what we had done. I never had that problem again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner’s longtime former media maestro, Kevin Hall, recalled that when Warner took his Senate seat in January 2009, three Virginia newspapers had full time correspondents who “birddogged” Warner and the rest of the state’s congressional delegation daily. By the end of that year, Hall said, those papers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Virginian-Pilot and the Daily Press </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had shuttered their Washington bureaus and laid off their esteemed reporters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor-turned-senator is on the record in support of a vigorous, free and independent press, and the motivations are more serious than good relations with his home-state media. I appreciate his support, though I harbor no delusion that it can reverse losses in Virginians’ access to local public affairs reporting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are things no senator, no president, no legislative body can do. Those things </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like preserving government of, by and for the people </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reside with the people themselves.</span></p>

What I saw in my native state this month saddened me but increased my appreciation for my state of choice, Virginia, where such embarrassments are less likely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On live television, I saw the Republican supermajority in Tennessee’s House of Representatives expel two African American Democrats from the House to which their constituents had elected them in a scene that evoked Jim Crow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their offense? A noisy March 30 breach of House decorum, three days after someone armed with an assault-style rifle fired 152 rounds that </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/nashville-covenant-school-shooting-updates-3dfb2fcbb22ff8638074fd90c7b266fd" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">killed three 9-year-old children and three teachers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in just a few minutes at a church school a short cab ride from Nashville’s Legislative Plaza. As demonstrators clamored for tougher gun laws, the two Black lawmakers — Reps. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, and Justin Pearson, D-Memphis — led chants from the well of the House and used a bullhorn to engage with protesters in the gallery. A third Democrat, Rep.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 6, the House’s GOP leadership held a vote to expel all three. After hours of acrimonious, racially charged debate, Republicans, who control 75 of the chamber’s 99 seats, made an awful situation even worse by ousting the two Black men and falling a vote shy of the 66-vote (two-thirds) threshold for removing Johnson, who is White.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It might have something to do with the color of my skin,” Johnson said of narrowly surviving her ouster vote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without question, all three deserved punishment. Deliberative bodies can’t function amid such chaos. But House Republicans, drunk on their own hubris and hell-bent on the nuclear option, blew right past such measured responses for a first offense as censure or stripping the offending representatives of their committee assignments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expulsions were a grotesque abuse of discretion and an egregious, unforced error that stains Tennessee’s Republican elite. The optics are damning because the act was damnable. Perhaps House Speaker Cameron Sexton believed it might pass quietly or that it wouldn’t be perceived globally as a rank revival of 1950s-style Deep South racism. He was dreadfully wrong on both counts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underscoring the ugly futility of the House GOP’s actions, Democratic-dominated governing councils in Nashville and Memphis within six days had appointed </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/tennessee-expulsion-justin-pearson-35fd0a2e366e98fa170c4f7348246d03?user_email=eee64cefef241c2de2cc83098e60f0aa2d3f731f5c63b80a768dd10b6bd837e8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones and Pearson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, respectively, to return to the House and fill the vacancies their expulsions created. They will serve the interim appointments while running as prohibitive favorites in upcoming special elections for the remainder of their terms, costs the expulsions created that Nashville and Memphis taxpayers will bear.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a tactical standpoint, pro-gun forces at least momentarily ceded ground. Republican Gov. Bill Lee, saddened and sobered by the</span><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/tennessee-governor-reveals-nashville-shooting-121110705.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">loss of two family friends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the school shooting and the furious nationwide backlash against the expulsions, signed an executive order requiring stronger background checks for gun purchases. He also recommended passage of a “red flag” law that police and courts can use to remove guns from people who are a danger to themselves and others, a measure the GOP base broadly opposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tennessee’s House has cashiered members only twice since Reconstruction, according to</span><a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/04/tennessee-house-expulsions-history-legislative-members/70079648007/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tennessean</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It happened in 1980 to a representative convicted of soliciting a $1,000 bribe and in 2016 to a member accused by multiple women of sexual misconduct. Before that, you have to go all the way back to 1866, when six state representatives were removed for opposing Tennessee’s ratification of the 14th Amendment granting citizenship to formerly enslaved people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Tennessee, Virginia’s House and Senate are</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article4/section7/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutionally empowered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to punish members for misconduct or expel them on a two-thirds vote. Current</span><a href="https://publications.virginiageneralassembly.gov/display_publication/237" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">House rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state that for “frequent or repeated violations of order” that persist after a warning from the speaker, a delegate “will be liable to the censure of the House.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last Virginia House expulsion came in 1876 when </span><a href="https://history.house.virginia.gov/members/5931" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Robert Davis Ruffin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was removed over charges that he embezzled House funds, according to the office of House Clerk G. Paul Nardo. Two years ago, the Democratic-controlled Senate</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/virginia-politics/democrats-republicans-unite-to-censure-state-sen-amanda-chase" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">censured Sen. Amanda Chase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, R-Chesterfield, for “a pattern of unacceptable conduct” capped by her support for rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Tennessee, Virginia is a “Goldilocks” state — not too hot, not too cold; not too red, not too blue — more inclined toward partisan balance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Virginians stunned the political establishment by electing as governor a Republican in his first race for any public office over a previous governor and legendary Democratic rainmaker. The year before, Democrat Joe Biden won the commonwealth by 10 percentage points in his victory over Republican President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last House supermajority in Virginia was seated in 2014 when the GOP owned 67 of the 100 seats. The party came close in 2012 and in 2016 when it controlled 66 seats. Democrats held a 55-45 majority for 2020 and 2021, but the GOP has had 52 seats since the start of 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rural Virginia shares a strong, pro-Republican kinship with Tennessee — a slim, 500-mile Republican-voting expanse from the Appalachians west to the Mississippi River except for</span><a href="https://onthehill.tnjournal.net/check-out-these-precinct-level-maps-of-the-presidential-election-in-tennessee/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic-voting islands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in metropolitan Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga. Legislative Republicans further optimized their numbers by controlling  Tennessee’s 2021 redistricting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the vote of conservative rural localities is counterbalanced by the densely populated and Democratic-leaning urban/suburban crescent that bends from the sprawling Washington, D.C., suburbs and exurbs, south to the Richmond area, then southeast down the Peninsula to Hampton Roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also unlike Tennessee, where legislators pick their voters rather than the other way around, Virginia’s reapportionment is done by an independent</span><a href="https://www.virginiaredistricting.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Redistricting Commission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or, should the commission fail as it did two years ago, by the Virginia Supreme Court. In lines the court drew without regard for party or incumbency for this year’s 140 General Assembly seats, neither Democrats nor Republicans gained appreciably, though rural population losses concentrated more districts in the suburbs and cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less quantifiable but nevertheless relevant is this: using a bullhorn to hijack discourse on Virginia’s House or Senate floors is hard to imagine. But it’s easier to conceive than one party reflexively using expulsion, which denies tens of thousands of voters their elective voice in government, as redress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Richmond’s Capitol Square, the ancient, genteel notion of “the Virginia Way” has been battered and tattered by increasingly acidic partisanship, but it hasn’t flatlined … </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yet</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then again, what happened in Nashville on April 6 was unimaginable, too, when I sat in the Tennessee House’s press section 40 years ago.</span></p>

I am not an alumnus of his school. To the best of my recall, I have never been on GMU’s campus in Fairfax. But I applaud Mr. Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He did what many leaders in academia are unwilling to do these days: He stood up to demands to bar a speaker whose positions many on his campus abhor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The speaker in this case is the governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin. After he was invited to be GMU’s spring commencement speaker, a student launched an</span><a href="https://www.change.org/p/oppose-youngkin-as-gmu-commencement-speaker" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">online petition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calling for the governor’s invitation to be rescinded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the grounds posited in the petition were his administration’s advancement of policies that limit rights of trans people, that restrict access to literature and that suppress racial equity in  public school curricula. Those actions, the petition asserts, result in “historically marginalizing communities comprising Mason,” and asks Washington to exercise an official, preemptive “</span><a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/968/heckler-s-veto" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heckler’s veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” on the petitioners’ behalf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I get it. I have voiced objections to all of those policies. The actions against trans people – particularly students – are, in my estimation, wrong and mean-spirited. I understand how they cause real angst, anger, hardships and emotional harm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The First Amendment, however, prevails over hurtful, hateful, sometimes even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">inciteful</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> speech, as the U.S. Supreme Court</span><a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/728/village-of-skokie-v-national-socialist-party-of-america-ill" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has</span></a><a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/55/de-jonge-v-oregon#:~:text=Society%2C%20public%20domain)-,In%20De%20Jonge%20v.,combined%20with%20conduct%20or%20action." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled</span></a><a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/425/terminiello-v-chicago#:~:text=the%20Associated%20Press)-,In%20Terminiello%20v.,for%20making%20inflammatory%20public%20comments." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">repeatedly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In a society that values free expression, Youngkin has every right to speak, including at Virginia’s largest state-supported university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America, sadly, is a culture that increasingly accepts demands to shut down protections that the First Amendment affords us all, especially from radicalized and growing segments of both the political left and right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The headlines are packed with stories of school boards </span><a href="https://www.windsorweekly.com/2023/03/10/isle-of-wight-county-schools-bans-teaching-on-systemic-racism/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">muzzling a truthful accounting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in public school history curricula of the historical mistreatment of African Americans and the</span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/14-books-being-removed-from-spotsylvania-school-libraries/3317248/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banning of books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that discuss subjects of gender and sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">College campuses, traditionally havens for the free exchange of ideas, informed inquiry and robust debate, are not exempt. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education reports that students</span><a href="https://www.thefire.org/student-censorship-and-academic-growth-paradox-higher-education" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">increasingly support disinviting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> speakers from their campuses. It found that Democratic students were 19 percentage points more likely than Republican students to concur that there are times when speakers should be canceled. Last spring at the University of Virginia, the charge to disinvite former Vice President Mike Pence came from none other than the campus newspaper, the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/18/when-a-student-newspaper-calls-for-banning-campus-speech-basic-freedoms-are-threatened/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cavalier Daily</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s put aside the fact that a public university has no legal or moral business taking sides and censoring a public policy debate absent a credible threat of violence. There’s a more practical argument against silencing disfavored speech: it doesn’t work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one is being forced to accept what Youngkin says. But what harm comes from listening firsthand to what the speaker is actually saying? How does one effectively rebut a speaker’s assertions without understanding them?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, nothing prohibits opponents from peacefully expressing their own views. The same constitutional right that protects the speaker allows opponents (even graduates in their robes) to turn their backs in protest. People can distribute literature or hold a news conference contradicting a speaker’s points. They can boo or, more unsettling, meet applause lines with cold silence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">— </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all under the media’s unblinking eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what is to be gained by denying a speaker a campus forum where he or she can be challenged face-to-face? Those interested in what the speaker would say can easily find it on the internet, often in forums free of the dissenters’ balancing arguments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling for adversarial speech to be silenced is lazy and counterproductive. Competing in the marketplace of ideas with your own concepts is hard but it works. It comes down to how much you really believe in the might and merit of your argument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though legal proceedings challenging the behemoth facility that will eventually encompass up to 1.7 million square feet are</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/21/wegmans-business-groups-ask-virginia-supreme-court-to-overturn-hanover-ruling/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the facility is already largely built, to the considerable detriment of families that have lived there for generations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Wegmans hub,</span><a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=3180491157314184JmltdHM9MTY3OTg3NTIwMCZpZ3VpZD0xM2JjZjMwMC05ZDk3LTZjNjUtMDhkZi1lM2M4OWNlMjZkZjEmaW5zaWQ9NTQ0Mg&amp;ptn=3&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=13bcf300-9d97-6c65-08df-e3c89ce26df1&amp;psq=wegmans+distribution+center+traffic+daily+trips&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGFub3ZlcmNvdW50eS5nb3YvRG9jdW1lbnRDZW50ZXIvVmlldy80MDAyL1dlZ21hbnMtRkFRcyM6fjp0ZXh0PXRyYWZmaWMlMjBpbXBhY3QlMjBhbmFseXNpcyUyMGhhcyUyMGJlZW4lMjBwcmVwYXJlZCUyMHdoaWNoJTIwc2hvd3MsZ2VuZXJhdGlvbiUyMGJhc2VkJTIwb24lMjB0aGVpciUyMHNpbWlsYXIlMjBQZW5uc3lsdmFuaWElMjBkaXN0cmlidXRpb24lMjBjZW50ZXIu&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by its own estimate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will generate 2,864 additional daily vehicle trips along a stretch of Hanover’s Sliding Hill and Ashcake roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 2019 through last year, the</span><a href="https://www.treds.virginia.gov/Mapping/Map/CrashesByJurisdiction" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recorded 217 crashes on Sliding Hill and Ashcake, about one-fourth of which resulted in injuries to 76 individuals. Property damage resulted from the other 166 crashes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other consequences, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rainfall, once absorbed or at least slowed by soil and ground cover, will wash off the distribution center roofing over the equivalent of 19 football fields and its surrounding tarmac. The runoff will inundate ditches, creeks and streams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security and parking lot lighting will illuminate the Wegmans property (and, in part, properties nearby) from dusk to dawn. Forklifts that load and unload cargo trailers at scores of sally ports will emit their piercing beeps when they’re backing up as safety protocols dictate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn’t have to be this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This project was a power play from the outset with big money all in to win.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://westfaironline.com/retail/exclusive-an-inside-look-at-wegmans-leadership-strategy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the nation’s largest privately held businesses. It has 50,000 employees and operates 103 upscale stores across seven states. Annual sales in 2019 totaled $9.7 billion. Former Gov. Ralph Northam added $2.35 million in taxpayer dollars plus a goodie bag of tax breaks to sweeten Hanover’s dowry to Wegmans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hanover property was not initially zoned for so huge an enterprise, but the county’s Board of Supervisors helpfully </span><a href="https://www.hanovercounty.gov/DocumentCenter/View/4665/Rezoning-Ordinance?bidId=" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved an exception</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, notwithstanding concerns about neighbors’ lost tranquility and potential home devaluation. Particularly affected was Hanover’s Brown Grove community, founded after the Civil War by formerly enslaved people. Some of their descendants still live there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When several unhappy homeowners sued in 2020 challenging supervisors’ project approval, Hanover’s Circuit Court ruled that the plaintiffs “lacked standing” for the legal challenge because they hadn’t specified a “particularized harm” beyond what the public generally might suffer. On appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court last month overturned that decision and returned the case to the local court for adjudication of the homeowners’ claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, a platoon of lawyers has asked the Supreme Court to reconsider its February ruling, arguing that it could invite land-use litigation and disturb “decades of settled zoning decisions.” A who’s who of crony capitalism sides with Wegmans, including various chambers of commerce, the Virginia Economic Developers Association, the Virginia Association of Realtors, the Virginia Association of Counties and the Virginia Municipal League.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big money is accustomed to having its way and never gladly surrenders even its slightest advantage. So it is naturally anxious at the prospect of affording due process to ordinary folk who can demonstrate that their rights have been bulldozed by the combined might of the well-connected/well-heeled and their governmental allies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six years ago, Tim Miller and his wife, Kathy Woodcock, moved from a Western Henrico County subdivision to a spacious, new farmhouse on 85 gently rolling acres of fields and woodlands in Hanover “with a mind to enjoy the peace and quiet, enjoy the solitude — get back to nature.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One day last week, Miller grimaced at the constant groan of heavy machinery and the incessant beeps of vehicles in reverse on the Wegmans work site. Several times in less than half an hour, southwesterly gusts lifted up towering plumes of grayish dust from the construction site’s bare dirt, blew it across narrow Ashcake Road and toward their house 700 feet away. He hopes, with modest conviction, that years from now a buffer of pine and cedar saplings he has planted on his side of Ashcake will provide a barrier, at least obscuring the building if not damping its noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In my house, sometimes I can literally </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> those machines,” said Miller, a plaintiff in the lawsuit along with his wife. “When the wind’s blowing out of the south, I have been able to hear conversations among the workers over there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another neighbor, Chris French, acknowledges the need for economic development. A smaller, less intrusive project would have found broad community acceptance, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nobody’s against development in its proper context,” French said. “What’s happened here is the county turned a blind eye to us and all they had was dollar signs in their eyes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a locality hidebound by history, Hanover has been</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2022-02-24/hanover-church-anchors-historic-black-community-of-brown-grove" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">far less observant of Black history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Just as communities of color in</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tulsa-s-greenwood-neighborhood-found-prosperity-after-1921-massacre-then-n1268455" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tulsa, Oklahoma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Richmond’s</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-03-07/reconnect-jackson-ward-interstate-95-cap-grant" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jackson Ward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and elsewhere were bisected and left to wither when interstate highways were routed through them, Hanover’s Brown Grove has also been carved up and sacrificed at the altar of economic development, said Pat Jordan, president of the Hanover County NAACP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They slowly destroy the fabric of a community,” Jordan said, “and in Hanover, there are so many examples of that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wegmans wasn’t without other, perhaps more workable options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the world’s largest retailer,</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266595/leading-retailers-worldwide-based-on-revenue/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Walmart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, scouted Virginia for a distribution hub a few years back, it settled on a site off U.S. 15 just several hundred yards from its interchange with Interstate 64 in rural Fluvanna County. In Hanover, traffic for the Wegmans facility will travel a couple of miles or more through several intersections in business and residential areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynicism spreads at pandemic rates among Americans struggling to pay their bills, sometimes working multiple gigs. Many believe the system is rigged against them, something demagogic politicians exploit, often augmented by conspiratorial fallacies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When enormously wealthy businesses throw their weight around, bigfoot established communities and then, alongside the very officeholders those residents elected, enlist teams of high-priced attorneys to impose their will, it validates those cynical beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk into any Wegmans and displayed high on a prominent wall you will see a photo of the grocery chain’s late leader, Robert B. Wegman, emblazoned with a quote from him: “Never think about yourself; always help others.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excuse folks in places like Brown Grove if they don’t buy it.</span></p>

(Photo by Matt Cardy/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a good bet that an election-year bill to crack down on juvenile access to online pornography, which elected legislators of both parties <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/09/bill-to-require-additional-proof-of-age-for-porn-sites-in-virginia-heads-to-youngkins-desk/" target="_blank">passed overwhelmingly</a>, will become law in Virginia. Penalizing smut purveyors plays well on campaign brochures, ads and websites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political cynicism aside, however, there is meritorious intent behind</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB1515ER" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Bill Stanley’s bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to hold internet publishers of material harmful to children, specifically that of a sexually explicit nature, legally liable if they do not secure documented proof of a user’s age before granting access. That proof would take the form of some sort of government-issued ID.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley, R-Franklin County, is correct in calling underage consumption of internet porn an epidemic. Exploitative, graphic and outright gross representations of human sexuality over the past 50 years has proliferated from magazines in sleazy bookstores to instant, on-demand access on smartphones ever-present in the pockets of teens.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/technology/porn-teens-online-report.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Common Sense Media released in January found that an alarming three-fourths of teens have viewed online porn by their 17th birthdays with the average first exposure at age 12. So pervasive is internet flesh-peddling that 41% of the minors surveyed reported viewing nudity or sex acts during the school day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Psychologists and organizations that treat addictive behaviors have long warned of the norm-shattering, mind-twisting, lifelong</span><a href="https://www.councilonrecovery.org/how-pornography-affects-the-teenage-brain-an-infographic/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from exposure to porn at such a vulnerable age. As much as many position the issue as a moral and a societal failure, it is also, unquestionably, a mental health crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it’s imminently reasonable to empower people to sue deep-pocketed online smut purveyors for the wreckage they cause in children’s lives, as Stanley’s bill does. The New York Times</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/technology/porn-teens-online-report.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that data gathered by XBIZ, an adult-content trade publication, shows  revenues for porn influencers and platforms rose from $5 billion in 2012 to at least $15 billion last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stanley’s legislation, now on Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s desk, would require submission of some form of government-issued identification to prove that users are 18 or older to access nothing-left-to-the-imagination sex sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That has caused alarm about entrusting highly sensitive personally identifying data to porn sites, many of which operate in the darkest alleyways of the web and in countries outside the reach of U.S. (and Virginia) law. There is legitimate fear that identity thieves will be the ultimate beneficiaries of porn age-verification measures such as Virginia’s and a similar one that took effect in Louisiana earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="https://www.cyberghostvpn.com/en_US/privacyhub/us-porn-id-laws/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">PrivacyHub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a newsletter published by privacy advocates, some websites can properly handle the data gathering, but not all would be so adept or scrupulous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“… The additional data handling still opens up new avenues for cybercriminals and government entities to abuse these systems for data harvesting. Using that personal information, cybercriminals can steal your identity or carry out a number of cyber-attacks, including sextortion and spear phishing,” said a PrivacyHub</span><a href="https://d.docs.live.net/2812febced1923cf/RQLewis%20LLC/THE%20READ/the%20additional%20data%20handling%20still%20opens%20up%20new%20avenues%20for%20cybercriminals%20and%20government%20entities%20to%20abuse%20these%20systems%20for%20data%20harvesting.%20Using%20that%20personal%20information,%20cybercriminals%20can%20steal%20your%20identity%20or%20carry%20out%20a%20number%20of%20cyber%20attacks,%20including%20sextortion%20and%20spear%20phishing." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">article </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, you can just bypass your state’s restrictions using a virtual tool people in totalitarian regimes such as Russia, China and Iran use to evade their countries’ internet censors and access news from the West: virtual private networks. Developed to protect people from internet snoops, VPNs conceal a user’s IP address, meaning that a user in, say, Norfolk could appear to be logged in from Phoenix or Seattle or virtually any city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s children are more tech savvy before they reach kindergarten than most of their parents. My 2-year-old grandson not long ago began playing with his family’s TV remote and, in just a few minutes, had purchased a Disney movie. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workarounds to the Louisiana law are already being posted online. And there’s the age-old standby of stealing mom’s or dad’s ID to access porn sites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outright proscriptions of various activities harmful to kids, though necessary, are largely ineffective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ban people younger than 21 from buying or consuming alcohol, yet underage drinking contributed to more than 3,900 deaths in that age group annually and cost the U.S. economy $24 billion in 2010,</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/minimum-legal-drinking-age.htm" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ban vaping by those younger than 18, yet the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration last year reported that underage e-cigarette usage is</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/teen-vaping-rates-rise-nearing-pre-pandemic-levels-cdc-reports-rcna50994" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching pre-pandemic levels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when it was blamed for widespread juvenile nicotine addiction and serious lung ailments among high school and even middle school students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until the government and the economy give a break to parents or other children’s primary caregivers — hopelessly stretched thin and often working multiple jobs to meet rising expenses — there aren’t enough cops, courtrooms and lawyers in the world to ward off pornographers and the other wolves at their doors.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was something of a young pup in the Virginia Capitol press corps, at least in terms of tenure on the beat if not age, in 2001 when an astonishing number of exits from the Senate and House of Delegates shook Capitol Square.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all of the 12 delegates who announced their exits ahead of the 2001 elections for the 100 House seats were Democrats. Many of them, just a few years earlier when their party held the majority, pretty much ran things. Among the retirees were the immediate past House speaker, Tom Moss, and the former majority leader, C. Richard “Dickie” Cranwell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason was redistricting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2001, for the first time in Virginia history, Republicans dictated the </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/congressional-apportionment.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decennial reapportionment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by virtue of House and Senate majorities they won in 1999. In so doing, aided by quantum advances in digitized demography and computer technology, they redrew the lines to the Democrats’ maximum disadvantage. So surgically precise was the digital remapping that Republicans were able to select the exact block on which Cranwell resided and place it into a Republican-voting district where his chances at reelection ranged from nil to nada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of last Friday, the number of announced </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/redistricting-elevates-house-turnover/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House retirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had reached 14, eclipsing 2001’s high water mark, according to a tabulation by the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonprofit, nonpartisan tracker of money in state politics. Add in six </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/turnover-in-the-state-senate-2023/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">senators’ retirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, many with decades of tenure, and 20 pending departures that represent the aggregate loss of 325 years of legislative experience. Six of the announced farewells are from lawmakers with 20 or more years of experience, and they account for 204 of those years, or 63% of the cumulative institutional memory loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another 12 delegates and one senator are also leaving their seats to seek another office rather than seek reelection — many of them are delegates avoiding a primary clash with another sitting delegate. The senator, Jennifer McClellan, D- Richmond, left to fill the vacant congressional seat of the late Rep. Don McEachin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason, again: redistricting. But this time it wasn’t partisan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years ago, Virginians approved a statewide referendum establishing a nonpartisan commission to take over the nakedly partisan process that the Legislature had always handled. After the commission’s</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/08/va-redistricting-commission-implodes-as-republicans-reject-compromise-and-democrats-walk-out/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">abject failure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to do its one job, the task was taken over by the Virginia Supreme Court.  This yielded dramatically reconfigured legislative and Congressional lines which, refreshingly, showed no regard for incumbency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the House, there are 22 districts in which two or more incumbents reside, including 20 that pair sitting delegates of the same party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, eight of the 40 districts pit two incumbents against each other, including six in which sitting senators are of the same party. Those include the districts of retiring Sens. Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, and Tommy Norment, R-Williamsburg, who have swapped the powerful title of majority leader back and forth for most of the past decade, depending on whose party held the slim majority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How the departures will affect the partisan balance of power in the General Assembly that will take its seat next January is hard to predict. A gauntlet of primaries — many of them sure to be bruising — cloud this fall’s general election contests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infusion of new blood into the process is healthy and inevitable. Bob Holsworth, a longtime Richmond-area political analyst and retired dean of the College of Humanities and Sciences at Virginia Commonwealth University, calls Virginia’s new nonpartisan redistricting system “a backdoor term limits law” for the number of incumbents it has pushed from the stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you like term limits, then you think this is fantastic. If not, then it’s problematic,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New lawmakers come to Richmond with new perspectives. They are less bound to the hoary traditions of the House and Senate or the norms of political deportment and increasingly act as mavericks. They’ve also, in recent years, tended to be more doctrinaire – Democrats who tend to be more liberal and Republicans who are more conservative or “Trumpy” — which confounds the lost legislative art of compromise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another consequence of losing so much collective experience, particularly in the Senate, is an indirect shift of power away from elected lawmakers, Holsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s going to be a challenge,” he said. Newbies who replace veteran leaders who bring decades of institutional knowledge to their powerful roles overseeing critical policy areas of government will face a time-consuming learning curve. Until the replacements learn the ropes, the process seeks out others to fill the expertise gap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The challenge is that power doesn’t go away. That power goes to the staffs and to the lobbyists,” Holsworth said. “That power will still be there, but a lot of it won’t be in the hands of legislators until they catch up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lobbyists and legislative staff in Virginia already enjoy outsized importance and input by virtue of one of the most abbreviated annual legislative calendars in America. Our General Assembly has routinely</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/28/another-session-with-vital-work-left-undone-virginia-outgrows-its-part-time-legislature/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">busted its deadlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for finishing essential work  within those truncated timelines throughout the 21st century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The other person who will benefit from this will be the governor. He has a large staff and advisers to help him,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there’s a wistfulness at seeing these legislators who have been fixtures on Capitol Square for generations leave. Like them or not, these are the personalities that animate the staid, unchanging, dry-as-dust legislative process. The friendships they forge over those decades of service can’t just be turned off on the way out the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for every one of the long legislative careers that end this year — some of which, like Saslaw’s and that of Del. Ken Plum, D-Fairfax, exceed 40 years — there was that scary first day of their freshman terms when they were at the bottom looking up and asking directions to the restrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in an institution with historical roots more than 400 years old, change remains the only constant.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a long time since the biggest business in Virginia was tobacco. Or since people hunted rabbits where rail mass transit and office towers now stand in Tysons. And since a drive from Bristol to Winchester consumed a whole day on looping two-lane roads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One constant during that span is the amount of time Virginia’s elected legislators allow themselves to assess those changes — and the dizzying increase in the pace of the changes — that have inundated the commonwealth since the middle of the 20th century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And on Saturday, for the sixth consecutive year, the General Assembly adjourned its regular winter session with its most important work unfinished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislatively, the nation’s 12th largest state by population and</span><a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/gdp-by-state" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">13th largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by gross domestic product uses the same part-time model that it used 50 years ago or more. Residing, as it does, hard against the boundary of the nation’s capital and now as a major global crossroads of the internet, Virginia still presumes to need only 46 to 60 days, depending on the year, to formulate policy solutions for issues that would have been considered science fiction during the Eisenhower administration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The part-time legislature is a fiction. It was great for the 19th and maybe 20th century. To say they can get their jobs done in an abridged legislative session is silly. It’s not possible anymore,” said Mark Rozell, founding dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. “The task of governing is too complex to be completed in such a short period of time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/21/virginias-legislature-was-built-agrarian-times-is-it-time-an-update/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he wrote for the Washington Post last March, Rozell noted that Virginia is among 26 states that have what the National Conference of State Legislatures calls a “hybrid legislature,” a broad midpoint between the 10 states with full-time, professional legislatures and the 14 that are strictly part time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 11 states more populous than Virginia, he wrote, six have full-time legislatures. He also notes that </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/about-state-legislatures/2020-legislator-compensation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative pay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia ($18,000 for senators, $17,640 for delegates with $210 per diem for both each legislative day) is in the bottom third for hybrid legislatures. West Virginia, he discovered, with one-fifth Virginia’s population, pays its lawmakers $20,000 annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one sense, this should not reflect on the 140 members of the General Assembly. They’re painted into a corner in which they’ve finished their work within the short time prescribed just eight times in the past 24 years. Since 2000, they’ve required </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one special session to complete their essential work in 16 of those years. Four of those years — 2021, 2018, 2008 and 2004 — required </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">than</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one extra session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet it’s a dilemma only the General Assembly can fix. It alone has the authority to modernize a legislative system locked into a time when Virginia was a somnolent, Dixiefied, agrarian economy. Indulging the conceit that the level of study and debate required for lawmaking in 2023 can be achieved on yesteryear’s terms is indeed folly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider that the commonwealth’s population of 3.3 million in 1950 increased by 162% — to nearly 8.7 million — by 2020. Consider also that the state’s operating budget of</span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/bill/2000/1/HB29/Chapter/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$21.4 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in fiscal year 2000 almost quadrupled to</span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/bill/2022/2/HB30/Chapter/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$80.6 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the fiscal year that ended last June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While there is much to be said for the ideal of a “citizen legislature” whose members remain more connected to their communities than they can in the myopic Capitol Square process, there’s also something to be said for time to deliberate and get the job done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I watched the process melt down and spill into extra innings many times firsthand in my decades of covering the Legislature. In the few sessions when the House and Senate adjourned on schedule (or reasonably close to it) without going into a special session, there was a sense of weary happiness and accomplishment. There were celebrations, including some in the Capitol’s media filing quarters that remain legendary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, regular-session adjournment in years when an unfinished budget or other essential business necessitated trudging back to  Richmond in the spring and/or early summer for an indefinite period was met with near-universal dread and discord. Legislators knew their real lives and livelihoods would be disrupted and, as former Del. Barnie K. Day described it in his 2005 insider’s look at legislative processes, the</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Notes-Sausage-Factory-Barnie-Day/dp/1556182104" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sausage-grinding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would resume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a massive amount of work that the General Assembly shoehorns into one of the shortest legislative meeting schedules in the nation. The brunt of that heavy lifting falls on  the staff of the committees where bills either die or advance to the floor. That’s particularly true for the committees that decide the final shape of the state budget — the House Appropriations and Senate Finance committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the closing days of a legislative session, as a dozen or so senators and delegates from those committees huddle behind closed doors to reconcile differences between the House and Senate versions of the budget, I’ve watched staffers of those committees toil almost round-the-clock, fighting off sleep with bad coffee and energy drinks as they crunch hundreds of pages of numbers, hoping it will hasten a deal and — fingers crossed — a dispositive floor vote  in an impossibly short timeframe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That didn’t get done this year. It hasn’t since 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other committees deal with staggering workloads under the same punishing schedules, including the Courts of Justice, Public Safety, Transportation, Education and Health, Welfare and Institutions committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operational math of the 2023 regular session alone gives you a sense of the workload. According to</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+oth+STA" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Legislative Information System’s statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the General Assembly this year dealt with just over 3,000 separate pieces of legislation, counting 166 carried over from 2022. Of that, 2,062 were bills which, if passed and signed by the governor, become law. Forty percent passed both chambers; 60% failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spread across the full 46-day run of this year’s “short session,” that would average final action on 45 bills per day. But that’s not how it works. Lawmakers tarry and jam most of their action into a couple of frantic weeks just before crossover (each chamber’s mid-session deadline for passing legislation it originated) and final adjournment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fatigue can cause concentration to lapse. Errors get made. Tempers grow short.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given such procrastination by lawmakers, however, it’s a tribute to the legislative staffs that so few blunders are made. One notable</span><a href="https://youtu.be/V2bROprwinQ" target="_blank"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">d’oh!</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was in 2004 when errant bill drafting inadvertently reinstated Virginia’s Victorian-era blue laws requiring businesses to close on Sundays. Dour lawmakers returned to Richmond in July for that year’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">second</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> special session to enact a</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?043+sum+SB6002" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative patch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the compelling case for legislative reform, it’s the elephant in the room that’s seldom spoken about. Change never comes easy in the Old Dominion. I’ll spare you the hackneyed joke about how many senators and delegates it takes to change a light bulb. And there seems no chorus of objection from either lawmakers themselves or the citizenry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as long as we’re dealing with down-home bromides, let’s not forget the cautionary tale about what happens when you put 10 pounds of stuff in a five-pound bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was when the team was a perennial in the NFL postseason and won Super Bowls – something that hasn’t happened in 31 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was when the organization played in the cramped, outdated but cozy and collegial confines of RFK Stadium, which was actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Washington. That was before the organization lost its identity — literally — and became the subject of investigations by Congress and the National Football League.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I go further, a word of self-disclosure: I root for the New York Giants, Washington’s longtime in-conference rival. Plenty of folks who know that would impeach these words on that alone. (If it’s any consolation, I do root for Washington over the Dallas Cowboys.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My point here, however, is the public policy issue of governments using taxpayer money to erect opulent new arenas for lucrative private professional sports/entertainment franchises and the plutocrats who own them. Neither Washington’s NFL team nor pro football broadly are unique in working that hustle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To that end, Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax, is to be applauded for stiff-arming Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s request to include in the state budget half a million dollars for a “study” on building a new stadium in Virginia for the Washington team, known of late as the Commanders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s to study? If a stadium just 26 years old is not to the liking of Commanders owner Daniel Snyder, he can amass the wherewithal to build one for his team, among the most</span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/193534/franchise-value-of-national-football-league-teams-in-2010/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">valuable in the NFL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And what are the odds that the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turns out to be a work of advocacy done by and/or for the very interests who want Virginia (and Virginians) to pay for the team’s cushy new digs?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the proposed research is to assess whether it’s in the commonwealth’s interest to finance – in whole or in part – top-end infrastructure for the Commanders, study after national study has examined the issue of using public money for private arenas and reached the same conclusion: no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Independent analyses show that taxpayer financing and incentives for privately owned professional sports teams across America yields, at best, negligible economic benefits to the community’s economy. Sometimes, such deals play out to a community’s detriment.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2017-05-01/the-economics-of-subsidizing-sports-stadiums/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017 by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis showed that economists overwhelmingly disapprove of public subsidies for sports venues as a way to foster growth within communities. Eighty-three percent of economists in a poll done that year agreed that &#8220;providing state and local subsidies to build stadiums for professional sports teams is likely to cost the relevant taxpayers more than any local economic benefits that are generated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One economist cited in the St. Louis Fed’s research, Michael Leeds, said that if every pro sports franchise in Chicago — baseball’s Cubs and White Sox, the NFL’s Bears, hockey’s Blackhawks and  basketball’s legendary Bulls — were to suddenly vanish, the hit to Chicago’s economy would measure a fraction of a percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports franchises have deep emotional attachments in the markets they serve and the owners of those teams have no qualms about threatening to move them if a state or local government won’t allow them to socialize their costs yet privatize the profits. That was</span><a href="https://econreview.berkeley.edu/the-economics-of-sports-stadiums-does-public-financing-of-sports-stadiums-create-local-economic-growth-or-just-help-billionaires-improve-their-profit-margin/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">among the findings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported in 2019 by the University of California at Berkeley’s “Berkeley Economic Review.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public financing, the report said, helps billionaires pay less for a service that they can afford, calling it “an unnecessary privilege rather than a necessity.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The owners will be compensated handsomely through the </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/193553/revenue-of-national-football-league-teams-in-2010/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">profits received through</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">ticket sales, corporate advertising, and concessions over the next several decades,” the Review said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NFL — the most popular and successful of America’s pro sports empires — and its franchises are among the most aggressive in strong-arming the public sector, often under an implied or even explicit threat to decamp for other cities more willing to avail the public purse to them. The only NFL team not held by high net worth individuals or families is the Green Bay Packers,</span><a href="https://www.packers.com/community/shareholders" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively owned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for 100 years by a nonprofit corporation’s 537,000</span><a href="https://en.as.com/en/2021/12/01/nfl/1638327465_196656.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheesehead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shareholders. This explains why it has thrived in the smallest city of any major pro sport, using the same hallowed stadium the past 66 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most pitiable example is St. Louis. The NFL’s Cardinals called St. Louis home for 28 years before moving in 1988 to Arizona. In 1995, the Rams left Los Angeles and its 72-year-old Coliseum, twice an Olympic venue, for a domed stadium in St. Louis. The Rams moved back to LA in 2016 and now share posh, new SoFi Stadium with the city’s other NFL team, the Chargers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No city wants to be</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> St. Louised</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoFi is one of just three NFL stadiums built without public funding, according to reporting by the</span><a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/pay-to-play-how-21-nfl-stadiums-have-been-financed/article_319a3686-0c28-11ec-a568-dbcbdd817498.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Buffalo News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The other two are MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, home to the New York Jets and the Giants, and Gilette Stadium near Boston, home to the 21st century’s most successful NFL team, the Patriots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersen recognizes the proposed Commanders’ stadium study for what it is: the camel’s nose beneath the tent. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington’s football team has gorged at Virginia’s public trough before. In 2012, the team’s then-general manager, Bruce Allen (brother to former Gov. George Allen) joined then-Gov. Bob McDonnell and Dwight Jones, Richmond’s mayor at the time, to announce a sparkling new preseason training facility in Richmond’s Scott’s Addition neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond, in a Rube Goldberg deal with regional hospital giant Bon Secours, plowed millions of dollars into the enterprise, betting that local lodging and hospitality industries would reap a windfall from fans flocking to a couple of weeks of summer training camp in late July and August, the peak of Richmond’s suffocating summer swelter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a losing bet. The team used the facility from 2013 through 2019, and in each of those years, Richmond paid the franchise $500,000 to cover the expenses of trucking its operations from its home base in Ashburn to Richmond and then back up Interstate 95 when camp ended. The NFL’s COVID-19 protocols kept the team in Ashburn for 2020. It last used the Richmond facility for a handful of drills in 2021. It has since sat idle on 17 acres of prime real estate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 1997, Washington has played its home games at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, nearly 50 miles east of its Loudoun County practice facility. At age 26, the stadium is hardly ancient, but it’s the NFL’s ninth-oldest because of a building boom in which 17 new stadiums came online since 2000. During that span, the burgundy and gold posted the league’s</span><a href="https://champsorchumps.us/records/most-nfl-wins-since-2000#:~:text=NFL%20Team%20Stats%2C%202000%20-%202022%20%20,%20%2013%20%2028%20more%20rows%20" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sixth-lowest winning ratio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — 41.9%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, Washington isn’t alone in shaking down communities fearful of being </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. Louised</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Buffalo Bills extracted nearly $1 billion in public support from New York for a</span><a href="https://buffalonews.com/news/local/pay-to-play-how-21-nfl-stadiums-have-been-financed/article_319a3686-0c28-11ec-a568-dbcbdd817498.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$1.4 billion stadium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expected to open in 2026. In Nashville,</span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2023/02/16/bob-mendes-pushes-for-rejection-of-tennessee-titan.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">public officials are balking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the Tennessee Titans’ demand for a $2.1 billion domed stadium to replace 24-year-old Nissan Stadium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia can refuse to be dictated to by a wealthy sports franchise. It’s why Chap and the Senate should stand firm.</span></p>

It was in June two years ago when Johnny spiraled into a mental health crisis, this one requiring police intervention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violence isn’t Johnny’s nature in spite of abuse he allegedly suffered at the hands of his birth parents before he was removed from them at age 8 and put into foster care. Though there was every expectation that he would be hardened, bitter and mean, he’s a sweet, gentle and self-deprecating young man of 20 with a childlike view of the world, say Kim and Jim Spencer, who adopted Johnny at age 11.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much hardship, however, isn’t without a sometimes painful legacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every year since we first met him, we knew that he had ups and downs. We knew that he had a mental illness and he’s been given a million different diagnoses. It’s been really difficult to get people to understand how his mind works. You can look at the brain of someone who has been through trauma and their brain has changed,” Kim said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She would know. Kim is a career mental health professional and co-owner of a Richmond-based firm that provides community-based support services for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that night in late June of 2021, the dark forces that torment Johnny near the start of each summer were exacerbated by a home renovation project that disturbed his sense of a familiar “safe space” and he went into a full-blown crisis, Kim and Jim said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unable to calm him and or find a mental health crisis intervention number, Kim did the only thing left to her: she called the Hanover County 911 emergency response number. Johnny had knocked the phone from her hand and crushed it, she said. In the melee, Jim suffered a cut above his eye that required two stitches to close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When police arrived, Jim said, “It looked like a SWAT squad. We have a long driveway and there were five or six of them running up the driveway,” he said. “The head officer stopped and talked to us a minute and Kim kept telling them our son was having a mental health crisis and that they needed to approach carefully, [to] try to calm him down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her own work with people with mental health issues, Kim learned the perils of not approaching individuals in crisis the correct way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve gotten my glasses knocked off my head, I’ve been punched, I’ve been kicked because, I now know, I approached that person in a way I shouldn’t,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the Spencers described was a takedown. Officers tried to talk to Johnny whose words were incoherent. They surrounded him. Then they rushed him and tackled him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That didn’t go well at all,” Jim said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the ensuing struggle, Johnny was charged with several counts of assaulting the officers, charges that have yet to be adjudicated at trial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johnny has no memory of the incident. And that’s common for people in the grips of a psychotic episode they didn’t cause and couldn’t control. That encounter and a revocation of his bond because he was found in possession of a knife resulted in Johnny spending most of his time since then either in custody or in Central State Hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s just one incident – one family known to this writer – yet it presents two distinct public policy issues to unpack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, there’s Virginia’s longstanding failure to adequately address mental health needs. Historically, the state’s infrastructure for dealing with residents with intellectual disabilities has been shamefully underfunded and its </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/21/as-state-mental-hospitals-struggle-lawmakers-eye-the-agency-overseeing-them/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">institutions understaffed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This manifests in sad but quiet ways such as the increasing number of </span><a href="https://www.brha.com/2022/08/02/a-look-at-the-current-state-of-homelessness-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homeless people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, especially in Virginia’s urban centers. Encounters such as Johnny’s leave individuals and their families scarred for years, but it largely escapes society’s notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasionally, however, it bursts forth in horrifying headlines: a delusional, angry student whose violent fantasies presaged the massacre of 32 people one April morning in 2007 at Virginia Tech; a state senator who was nearly killed in a knife attack by his son who was in the grips of a suicidal mental health crisis in 2014; a biology teacher who had removed his clothes in a crisis moment was shot dead as he charged toward police officers along a busy Richmond freeway in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of those heartbreaking, news-making instances resulted in changes to Virginia law. Rarely do encounters such as Johnny’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, we place an enormous burden on police officers who encounter mentally ill people at risk to themselves or others. Officers enter their dangerous and low-paid profession to enforce the law and keep the peace in an increasingly lawless and violent world. They’re not mental health counselors and they often respond to standoffs with the mentally ill the only way they know how – much as they would a cornered criminal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s General Assembly made efforts to help police deal with people having mental health emergencies after the encounter that left the teacher, Marcus David Peters, dead. Del. Jeff Bourne, D-Richmond, in whose district the tragedy occurred, won passage in 2020 of</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=202&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb5043" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a law named for Peters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It provides for a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">mental health response to behavioral health emergencies like Peters’s – and Johnny’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three years later, according to the Department of Criminal Justice Services and the </span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/human-resource-development-and-management/health-equity/mdpa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Marcus Alert System is operational in five regions: Virginia Beach, Richmond, Bristol and surrounding Washington County, Prince William County and in the region including Madison and Fauquier counties and the cities of Warrenton and Culpeper. Broader deployment was blocked with subsequent legislation that exempted localities of fewer than 40,000 residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Bourne introduced a bill to “de-felonize” violence that police sometimes encounter from people having mental health crises. His legislation never got a committee hearing in the Republican-controlled House. Similar bills have</span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2020-09-22/proposal-to-defelonize-assault-on-a-police-officer-dies-in-committee" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">also perished</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before legislative committees controlled by both parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, anyone convicted of attacking a police officer in Virginia is guilty of a Class Six felony, punishable by up to six months in jail. It doesn’t matter the circumstances, whether perpetrators are aware of or in control of their actions, or even whether the officer was injured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where legislating gets tricky. Understandably, no lawmaker is eager to cast a vote that would essentially make it open season on officers by people who could later try to escape accountability by claiming mental incapacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Bourne’s bill had safeguards against such loopholes. The legislation would have required validating a genuine mental health crisis claim to set aside a felony charge, including medical evidence and expert testimony under oath in court. Now past Tuesday’s deadline for House bills to win House passage and with no comparable Senate legislation, the measure is effectively done for this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s brutal for people like Johnny. The bad hand life and disability dealt him long ago becomes immeasurably tougher if he must also bear a felony conviction over a regrettable act outside his conscious control, that he can’t even remember, and that caused no significant or lasting injury or damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law must distinguish deliberate, malicious acts from involuntary ones arising from disabilities. The former must be punished; the latter must be treated. That happens only if a compassionate Virginia demands it.</span></p>

I treasured them for the same reason I loved fishing poles: they meant time spent hunting or fishing with my dad, granddad or uncle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guns didn’t scare me because I respected them. I was taught early that they are not toys and drilled on how to use and store them safely. I’ve done that as a father to two sons of my own, both now grown, when they were old enough to hunt and own a shotgun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was young, gun-owners’ organizations devoted more time and resources to shooter education than to lobbying for essentially unrestricted, universal access to even the deadliest war weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, with the modern Republican Party as the gun lobby’s groveling footman, even modest, common sense gun safety legislation is shredder fodder when GOP lawmakers get their hands on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s happening now in the Virginia General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/31/most-gun-storage-bills-appear-doomed-in-virginia-general-assembly/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this week,</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2350" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would require households in which children reside to safely store their firearms is dying before Republican-dominated committees in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill by Del. Marcus Simon, D-Fairfax, was a sensible response to a 6-year-old boy who allegedly took a legally purchased 9 mm handgun from his home and shot his teacher in an elementary school classroom in Newport News. A similar bill that passed the Senate likely faces the same fate in the House.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can speculate all day about why Newport News school officials didn’t find the gun despite multiple warnings that the child had it in his possession at school.</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lawyer-for-teacher-shot-by-6-year-old-student-says-administration-failed-to-act-on-warnings-that-boy-had-a-gun/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the wounded teacher, Abigail Zwerner, plans to file against the school district is likely to yield some damning answers. The child is too young to prosecute. No charges have been brought against his parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond speculation, however, is that if a child so young could get his hands on the weapon, take it to school and shoot someone, it was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> secured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are more guns in America than there are Americans to shoot them,  but there’s far  less accountability. Efforts to compel some accountability get buried in absurd rhetoric that casts “good, law-abiding and responsible gun owners” as victims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re not victims; they’re heroes, and they have nothing to fear from these bills. My father, granddad and uncle were imminently responsible gun owners who would bristle at such implied victimhood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only people who should fear this legislation are adults who can’t  – or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – keep their weapons out of small children’s hands.</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mixing politics, law enforcement and religion is a difficult high-wire act under the best of circumstances. Add in a sex sting operation and you’re toeing the wire over the Grand Canyon without a net or safety harness in the middle of a blizzard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County’s commonwealth’s attorney, Stacey Davenport, should know that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lurid, real-life soap opera with all those elements, and more turns than a mountain backroad, is playing itself out in Chesterfield County and showing up in headlines from sea to shining sea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It began at the end of an online chat that allegedly occurred between a Virginia Beach megachurch pastor and a police detective posing as an underage prostitute who directed him to a Chesterfield motel room in October 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Rev. John Blanchard, pastor of Rock Church International, was arrested and booked on charges of solicitation of prostitution. He was one of 17 men snared in a two-day Chesterfield County Police Department sting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three months ago, in October 2022, Davenport </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chesterfield’s Commonwealth’s Attorney </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced she would</span><a href="https://legaldictionary.net/nolle-prosequi/" target="_blank"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nolle prosequi</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (not pursue) the case against Blanchard, giving no explanation beyond suggesting that the evidence was insufficient to win a felony conviction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The interaction between the detective and the defendant in each case was different,” Davenport </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/crime/chesterfield-ca-responds-allegations-pastors-child-solicitation/291-d0ec8bdc-18ec-4787-96d1-80b6328e63ec" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcing the decision to not prosecute Blanchard’s case. “As a result, the evidence available for use in the prosecution of each case was different, and the outcome of each case was different. Some of the cases had sufficient evidence to support felony convictions, and some did not. As ministers of justice, prosecutors are required to individually evaluate the strength of the evidence provided by the police in each case.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blanchard vehemently asserted his innocence. He returned to the pulpit and called the charges against him “vicious and inhuman accusations” and said that statements made in support of the charges were “demonstrably false.” He also petitioned a court to expunge the charge from his record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You dress up a lie. You can twist it. You can misrepresent it. But I’m sorry, a lie is still a lie,” he said according to </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/mycity/virginia-beach/virginia-beach-pastor-dropped-charges-attempted-solicitation-minor-speaks-out/291-57ed0e5e-7d1a-490d-a8d1-47ed1489b21d" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a television report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps Davenport failed to anticipate the fires of condemnation ignited by her decision to not prosecute an influential pastor who allegedly drove nearly two hours for a “QV” (flesh trade shorthand for “quick visit”) in a suburban Richmond motel room with a person who purported to be a 17-year-0ld girl named Maddie. How such a public relations miscalculation is possible for a Republican elected to her job in 2019 with 54% of the vote </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and who seeks reelection this fall </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is bewildering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, Timothy Anderson, a lawyer and politically ambitious Republican who represents a Virginia Beach district in the House of Delegates, was among the first to raise hell. He used Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act to obtain police incident reports and posted the documents on his</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=669733374806464&amp;set=pb.100053094233188.-2207520000." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">law firm’s Facebook page.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The real game-changer, however, came in early January when Chesterfield County’s normally taciturn police chief, Jeffrey Katz, posted a blistering rebuke of Davenport’s decision on his</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ColJSKatz/posts/pfbid0aor1kdNqPQeXFKot6aYNPPfzwJgJY7VrccnagXNgzqGibM5JKNYrLJUskvUkzNsXl" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">police department Facebook page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In it, he acknowledged granting a FOIA request to release his department’s records in Blanchard’s case and argued, point by point, why Blanchard’s case should be tried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe a jury of Chesterfield County residents deserves to weigh in on the matter of criminal culpability,” Katz wrote. “The decision to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nolle prosse</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> [sic] this case has made such a deliberation impossible … but I want to be clear; this is NOT due to a lack of evidence or a substandard investigation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cops and prosecutors work closely together and sometimes disagree. In nearly 40 years as a journalist and six as a PR guy, I’ve never seen such a sensational public imbroglio between the leaders of two essential parts of the criminal justice system, as every fan of the long-running “Law &amp; Order” TV series can</span><a href="https://youtu.be/lMalvNeJFLk" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recite by heart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Katz’s fusillade, Davenport fired back. Sort of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a mid-January statement, she </span><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A7e80d859-7330-3fbc-8dd0-d68d5069b25e&amp;viewer%21megaVerb=group-discover" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called out Anderson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, saying her office “takes great exception” to his efforts to politicize the case. She said assertions that Blanchard’s expungement petition was a bid to “silence any political opponent [of her office] from using published police records is unwarranted and without merit.” What the statement didn’t include was any elaboration that would help the public understand where and why the case against Blanchard, at that time, fell short.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement further said that “moral outrage is no substitute for evidence, and this office stands by its decision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It did, too. For six more days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Davenport announced that new evidence had persuaded her to recommend reinstating the case against Blanchard. She also said she would step aside and entrust the matter to a yet-unnamed special prosecutor. Because Davenport chose to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">nolle prosequi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the case without prejudice, she had the option of resuming the prosecution without breaching Blanchard’s Fifth Amendment double jeopardy protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one might by now imagine, there was no information about the nature of the new evidence that put the prosecution back on track from Davenport’s brief remarks, all read from written text without taking any press questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This column is not a commentary on the rightness or wrongness of whether Blanchard should stand trial. I have not seen all the evidence in this case, and even if I had, I am not a lawyer and am unqualified to determine whether it meets legal and ethical standards for proceeding to trial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s about the persistent, airy refusals to provide better, more relevant answers and explanations that help ordinary people understand this sensational saga while respecting the legal protections and confidentialities of both the government and the accused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are communications professionals out there who advise and shepherd attorneys and public officials through the media maze. I’ve done it myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davenport was not without opportunities to provide a helpful, cogent explanation. For days, journalists invited her to do just that in on-the-record interviews, and I was one of them. (My offer still stands, by the way.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davenport’s an accomplished prosecutor whose reserve and reticence in this volatile case does her a disservice. The lurching, on/off/on-again approach to a case involving alleged efforts to victimize a minor not only hasn’t quelled the tempest, but has aggravated it in the court of public opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s left a door open for Republicans who might challenge her for the nomination. Appearing unsteady in the handling of Blanchard’s case also gives oxygen to the malignant foolishness advanced by conspiracists who claim a cabal of pedophiles controls major public and private institutions of national power.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More broadly, it feeds the cynical notion that justice needn’t apply to favored people in powerful positions, only to the poor and powerless – a notion that’s poisonous to the rule of law and the free civil society it sustains.</span></p>

I have little faith that the fates will bless me. I could put $10 on the sun setting in the west and somehow lose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if I were, I’d wager that one of the easiest bills to pass in the 2023 General Assembly will be bipartisan legislation to create and fund a new </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1465" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Advisory Committee </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">within the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services to tend to the ravages gambling addiction inflicts on society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not only laudable, it’s overdue. And the need for it gets greater by the month. Problem gambling is a worsening scourge because of the growth in new forms of gambling that have become legal in the commonwealth since the Virginia Lottery was created in 1987 and went online a year later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly has legalized several other types of gambling, including off-track and trackside pari-mutuel betting and, most recently, casino gaming and sports books. In the past two years, the toll on people who become compulsive gamblers and their families has skyrocketed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/03/virginia-lawmakers-want-to-create-new-state-committee-on-gambling-addiction/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mercury reported</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">recently, new callers to a hotline run by the </span><a href="https://vcpg.net/about/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Council on Problem Gambling</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (VCPG)</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">increased by 143% the past three years, up from 335 intake calls in 2020 to 816 last year. The numbers went hypersonic after Virginia first allowed legal sports betting for the 2021 Super Bowl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a devastating condition,” said</span><a href="https://chp.vcu.edu/about/staff/all-faculty/carolyn-e-hawley-phd-crc.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolyn Hawley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a professor in the Virginia Commonwealth University Department of Rehabilitation Counseling and VCPG’s president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People don’t realize that it’s got the highest suicide rate of all addictions. [Gambling] just wipes out their families,” said Hawley, who also directs the VCU-based Virginia Partnership for Gaming and Health, a joint project of the university, the Virginia Lottery, VCPG and the state Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, have cosponsored </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1465" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">companion</span></a><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB836" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this legislative session that would create a Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Advisory Committee. It would foster collaboration among companies that operate legal gambling in Virginia and organizations that try to prevent or treat individual out-of-control gambling crises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure absolutely deserves to pass and be signed into law. But how much of the wreckage wrought on human lives by compulsive gambling was predictable – even </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">knowable</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – before the legislature, in hot pursuit of easy revenue, went full-on Vegas mode the past few years and green-lighted sports and casino wagering?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve gone from just three forms of gambling to all these other forms in such a short, short window,” Hawley said.</span></p>

	</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Has it been worth the revenue that varied forms of gambling contribute to the state budget? (For the record, the Lottery contributed about </span><a href="https://www.valottery.com/playingmatters/givingback" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3.7 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the budget in the fiscal year that expired on June 30 for K-12 education.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the state has been miserly in returning a scant share of the money that Virginians legally wager to programs that aid problem gamblers, particularly from the newest additions to Virginia’s sanctioned wagering environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casino gambling is still in its infancy in Virginia. The first casino opened in a former Bristol shopping mall in July. In just its fifth month – November, the latest for which the</span><a href="https://www.valottery.com/winnersnews/latestwinners" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lottery has announced totals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – it reported revenue of $12.6 million from its slot machines and table games. Virginia&#8217;s Problem Gambling Treatment and Support Fund got $18,216, or 0.8%, of the $2.3 million in total state taxes the casino paid. An additional $4,500, or 0.2% of the taxes, went to a fund for families and children of gambling addicts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A casino is scheduled to open this week in Portsmouth, with another due to open this spring in Danville. Richmond voters narrowly rejected a referendum to locate a casino in the capital city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the fiscal year 2021 report on sports betting compiled by the Lottery and sent to Gov. Glenn Youngkin last July, sports wagers came to $1.3 billion in Virginia in just its first six months. After paying off winnings and taxes, the 10 sports book operators then in Virginia realized adjusted gross revenue of just under $50 million. Of that, about $5.4 million went into Virginia’s General Fund. Only $138,926 of that went to the problem gambling fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the second year of sports betting, total wagers were almost $4.3 billion with adjusted gross revenue of $183 million. Of the $28 million that went to the state general fund, the Gambling Treatment and Support Fund got only $702,968.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the 12-month period from December of 2021 through November 2022, the latest for which monthly</span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">state reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are available, nearly $5 billion was wagered but the Gambling Treatment and Support Fund realized less than $1.2 million, with more than half of it coming in August through November. The spike resulted from the General Assembly ending a practice that allowed the sports books to write off “promotional costs” such as no-risk introductory bets and other inducements to lure in as many players as possible. The tactic was a naked attempt to tempt more players by effectively placing a bookie in their pockets 24/7 via easy-to-use smartphone apps, a major reason why calls to the VCPG hotline more than doubled since 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports books entered Virginia two years ago with guns blazing. Advertising on TV and social media was gaudy, ubiquitous and – literally – made the whole thing look like one big, no-lose party. The wholesome first family of football, the Mannings, appears in ads that evoke a latter-day Roman bacchanalia for betting industry behemoth Caesars Sportsbook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Early on, it all seems so fun and people don’t understand the severity of it,” Hawley said. It’s no accident that the earliest bets are often the most lucrative for new players, particularly youthful ones, she said. Beginner’s luck is a hook. And the earlier someone starts, the greater the likelihood that it becomes a lifelong problem, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you look at people who have a gambling addiction, it no longer looks like fun. They’re no longer having fun gambling, they’re no longer having fun drinking. It becomes a need,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bipartisan legislation that creates a workable infrastructure through which those who fall victim to uncontrollable betting can get help is a good first step. But while they’re at it on Capitol Square this winter, maybe they should sweeten the pot for prevention and treatment. By a lot.</span></p>

A new tunnel will connect the Capitol with the new General Assembly building. (Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wasn’t it just the other day that Virginians were shaking our heads in dismay at a motionless cordon of traffic tens of miles long stranded overnight in brutal, subfreezing temperatures on a stretch of Interstate 95 north and south of Fredericksburg?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the first head-turning news event of 2022, when the year was still in its infancy. Plenty has happened in the days, weeks and months since then. Some of it was encouraging. Some of it was discouraging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may feel a bit unseemly to read the obituary for 2022 while it’s in its final hours and not yet officially consigned to the ages. But unseemly is what I do. It’s my job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s my take on the big moments of the past year.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Snowmageddon on I-95 (Jan. 3-4)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beleaguered from almost two years of COVID-19 pandemic privations, the term of Gov. Ralph Northam was just a week from its end when a snowstorm of unexpected severity left more than 800 vehicles gridlocked on a bitterly cold 40-mile stretch of the freeway for up to a day and a half.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the drivers encamped overnight in the frozen hellscape was U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, whose normal two-and-a-half-hour commute to Capitol Hill for the resumption of Congress turned into a frigid 27-hour in-car bivouac. The same was true for unknown hundreds of shivering travelers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An</span><a href="https://www.virginiadot.org/After_Action/Jan_2022_Winter_Weather_AAR_March_31_POST_EXECUTIVE_REVIEW_FINAL_acc040422.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">after-action report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blamed a freakish storm that began as a blustery rain after an unusually balmy holiday but unexpectedly turned into a serious winter storm that slammed the region with sleet and snow. The assessment faulted poor communications and a torpid initial response by Northam’s administration, but conceded that the rain beforehand made it impossible to pre-treat the road with brine or salt. Miraculously, there were no deaths or serious injuries in vehicles parked overnight and unreachable by first responders or even the National Guard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath, Northam’s Republican successor, Glenn Youngkin, has issued preemptive emergency declarations seemingly every time weather forecasts have called for a heavy frost.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Our full-time/part-time legislature (most of 2022)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After two years of total Democratic hegemony in Virginia government, voters acted in 2021 to return divided government to Richmond. They put Republicans in the top three statewide elective offices and gave them a narrow House of Delegates majority.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result: a legislative session that passed a state budget at the last minute to head off a partial shutdown of state services when the old budget expired at the stroke of midnight on June 30. The task of appointing two justices to fill vacancies on the short-handed state Supreme Court as it struggled with a growing backlog of cases also stretched out for interminable months. And they </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/07/virginia-lawmakers-fail-to-reach-deal-on-scc-pick/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">never got around</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to filling a vacancy on the State Corporation Commission, which will be down to just one of its three judges after </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/jagdmann-to-resign-leaving-state-corporation-commission-with-only-one-seat-filled/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judith Jagdmann resigns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> effective the end of this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, legislators buried partisan differences and did dog lovers like me a huge solid: they put</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/13/every-dog-has-its-day-the-best-thing-virginias-general-assembly-did-this-session/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">new restrictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a cramped, corporate beagle-breeding mill in Cumberland County that bred beagles as medical experimentation subjects. The facility finally closed this year after a series of damning federal reports on its conditions. The pups were released to shelters, and many are spending this holiday curled up with their adoring adoptive humans.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Unemployment claims backlogs (all year)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission finally made significant inroads into mountains of unemployment compensation claims that had languished for months on end from the early months of the pandemic. But it’s still not over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency was unprepared for an avalanche of unemployment claims resulting from layoffs and business failures starting in the spring of 2020. A withering report from the General Assembly’s investigative arm faulted poor management of the agency, scant oversight by Northam’s administration and outmoded technology for the failures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data the VEC provided last week, the agency removed or completed just over 900,000 cases in 2022, or 88% of what it received during the year. About 700,000 of those matters awaited the agency on Jan. 15 when Youngkin took office and sacked the agency’s previous leadership. Nearly 333,000 new matters came in since then. Of the 127,282 cases still pending, three-fourths are appeals of denied claims, 18% are potential fraud claims and just 6% are claims awaiting adjudication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slightly more than 90% of the 258,320 potential fraud claims with an aggregate monetary value of $1.56 billion in January have been investigated, according to VEC. The current dollar value of the 24,170 potential fraud claims awaiting investigation as of last week was just over $160 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Gun deaths (all year)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate at which Virginians are killing one another with firearms has climbed at an unsustainable rate the past three years. And it was driven home mercilessly by several mass killings that have shocked the conscience of the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With nine days left in this year, 20 separate mass shootings have killed 37 people and wounded 75 in Virginia in 2022, according to data from the</span><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Gun Violence Archive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The GVA, a nonprofit online database of firearm violence collected from law enforcement, government, media and commercial sources nationally, defines mass shootings as events in which four or more people are shot or killed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For 2022, Virginia ranks fourth nationally in mass shootings, trailing Texas (86 deaths, 193 wounded), California (60 dead, 190 wounded) and Illinois (51 dead, 254 wounded). As if that ranking isn’t damning enough, the number of mass shooting fatalities thus far this year is already more than double Virginia’s 2021 total of 16. In 2020, three were killed and 46 were injured in Virginia mass shootings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly half of 2022’s deaths occurred this fall. They include the Nov. 13 slaying of three University of </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/15/uva-shooting-witness-reveals-details/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia football players</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a bus returning from a class trip to Washington. A fourth player was wounded and a female student was also injured. On Nov. 22, seven people were fatally shot and six others were wounded in a Chesapeake Walmart. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An uneventful midterm (Nov. 8)</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, something unambiguously good: Virginia’s 2022 midterm congressional election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t laud it because of who won and who didn’t. For the record, Republicans flipped one Democratic U.S. House seat in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What made this election good was it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">worked</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Candidates ran hard, but when the votes were tallied, they accepted that the results expressed the will of the voters. The election wasn’t without warts. None ever are. But it was clean and it was well-run, affirming the faith I and others who have closely watched state elections for decades have in Virginia’s system of elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arizona still labors under legal challenges filed by a Trumpist former TV anchor and conspiracy fabulist who narrowly lost the governor’s race. Georgians had to hold a runoff election on Dec. 6 in which Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock defeated former Heisman Trophy winner and novice Republican candidate Herschel Walker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians, meanwhile, moved on to other things. Like whether their governor will spend the 2023 holidays trooping around primary battlegrounds like Iowa and New Hampshire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s rigorous testing, personal vetting and physical and mental training required before they wear the blue. Hopefully,  that process is careful and thorough and only the best, most fit make it through. But then there was Austin Lee Edwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edwards, 28, was a trooper for nearly a year and a half before he left the Virginia State Police in late October for a sheriff’s deputy job in Washington County near Bristol. He wasn’t on that job a month before he drove to Riverside, California, and sought out the child he had met online pretending to be someone else – a despicable practice known as “catfishing.” The carnage in his wake has generated sensational headlines worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Mercury’s Graham Moomaw filed a public records request with VSP for administrative documents and background checks on Edwards, the agency chose to “</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/08/virginia-state-police-wont-release-job-records-of-ex-trooper-who-killed-3-in-california/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exercise its statutory discretion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” and hide the documents from taxpayer view. Pressed for a reason for withholding information about Edwards, he was told that under state law, the agency isn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">required</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to comment further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VSP will only concede the obvious: that “human error” is to blame for the agency missing an incident in Edwards’s not-too-distant past during his hiring process. The agency said that no red flags emerged during his pre-employment background checks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-12-06/austin-lee-edwards-catfishing-cop-threats-kill-dad" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however, revealed that the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">incident</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> referenced was a 2016 mental health crisis in which Edwards threatened to kill his father and was ordered hospitalized by a court.</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/problem-solvers/mental-health-polygraph-december-14-2022" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">WTVR-TV in Richmond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported last week that Edwards revealed during a pre-employment interview that he had checked himself into a mental health facility that same year. On Thursday, Gov. Glenn Youngkin asked the Office of the State Inspector General to investigate Edwards’ hiring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stonewalling something like this is short-sighted and futile because of the likelihood that those details will be pried loose, if not by unhappy political leaders then in the discovery process of a wrongful death lawsuit. Even if the case doesn’t go to trial, such explosive material has been known to find the hands of enterprising journalists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State law doesn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">require</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the records of the individual in question be withheld. That was a choice. And it’s a choice that only serves to undermine the trust and confidence in law enforcement that is essential for the police to effectively do their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This columnist is not anti-police. I’ve known people at all levels of law enforcement and, for the most part, they’re dedicated professionals who do their jobs for low pay and at high risk because they’ve felt a call to serve. Some of the most genuine friends I have wear or wore the badge and I have chronicled the good work of many of them in my reporting. Edwards’ case, however, underscores that, like all of society, there are bad actors in their midst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement as an institution has work to do when it comes to public accountability, and it’s not just a passing political moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things came to a head in America after the broad-daylight murder of George Floyd by police officers on a Minneapolis street in May 2020. A tempestuous summer of nationwide protests over deaths of Black people at the hands of police, and arrests and incarceration rates for people of color far greater than their share of the population, drove new laws mandating greater transparency by law enforcement agencies. It led to the creation of citizen review boards and requirements that police report and sometimes publish information on police use-of-force incidents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Council of State Legislatures, 26 states have enacted law enforcement data collection and transparency laws since May of 2020, including seven – Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, Nevada, Washington and Wisconsin — that mandate publicly accessible databases of use-of-force information. Others post reports using aggregated data on use of force by officers on patrol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia began collecting data in July 2020 under the state’s Community Policing Act.</span> <a href="https://data.virginia.gov/stories/s/Virginia-Community-Policing-Act-Data-Collection/rden-cz3h" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that out of more than 2 million traffic stops since then, 31% of those included Black people, who are only 20% of Virginia’s population, compared to 63% of stops that included White people, who are 68% of the state’s residents in the 2020 census. The 2020 law also banned the police use of racial profiling in deciding which drivers to pull over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t sit well with some policymakers. As of last week, there was already</span> <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1401S" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one Republican bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduced in the House to repeal the Community Policing Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathering data on traffic stops, however, touches just one facet of law-enforcement answerability. Departments often go mute when their own are implicated in wrongdoing, and it often takes unrelenting public pressure to get a fuller accounting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last summer, Richmond Police Chief Gerald Smith called a press conference to make the fantastical claim that his department had discovered and disrupted a plot to carry out a mass shooting at Byrd Park in the city during July 4th festivities. Two days earlier, an assault-style rifle was used to kill six people and injure 30 who watched an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, so Smith’s tale had global resonance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenged repeatedly by journalists to provide evidence to buttress his claim, Smith resisted. As his yarn began to unravel, he bristled, insisting that his conclusion, based on his experience, was right and suggesting that the media were trying to impugn his officers, though they bore no role in Smith’s fiction. Already on thin ice and with his story discredited, he resigned last month and the record was belatedly set straight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith’s folly is trivial alongside the murderous depravity of Edwards. Here was a walking time bomb who left red-flag clues to his psychological instability, and it staggers the mind as to how they could be overlooked. He desecrated the oath he swore, right down to firing his service weapon at unarmed people and fellow officers before he turned it on himself and committed the last of his life’s many cowardly acts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, VSP, if this harsh assessment looks bad and smells bad, too bad. If we’re off base, release Edwards’s records and prove us wrong.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all due respect, Del. Tim Anderson, have you lost your mind?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re a first-term Republican member of the House of Delegates running for a second. Yet in the span of less than one month, your clear-eyed candor has put your credentials as a fire-breathing conservative in serious jeopardy, not once but twice, sir!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, not long after the anticipated red wave midterms turned out to be a purple ripple last month, you said out loud what tens – dare I wager, hundreds? – of thousands of Virginia Republicans likely thought: Maybe it’s time to move on from former President Donald Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, candidates Trump endorsed for high-profile governorships and U.S. Senate seats like Kari Lake in Arizona, Texan Herschel Walker in Georgia and former TV doctor Mehmet Oz lost despite a strong tailwind from an unpopular Democratic president and deep worries about inflation and the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The candidate Trump endorsed in Virginia’s three competitive congressional races, Yesli Vega, ran a strong race but lost to two-term 7th District Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s embarrassing to have so little to show in a midterm election during the first term of a president of the opposite party. Sheer inertia almost always drives better results in such elections for the out-of-power party. A supposed GOP rout in the House yielded only a spare Republican majority. And with Georgia Heisman Trophy-winning football legend Walker  losing in a Deep South state that was deep red just four years ago, Democrats improved from a 50-50 U.S. Senate split with Vice President Kamala Harris as their tiebreaker to a 51-49 majority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But did you have to speak that discomfiting truth to a GOP in which many still confer mythic status upon the lord of Mar-a-Lago? Those MAGA legions vote, sir, especially in primaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, with that welt still smarting, you pre-filed</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hj460" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">House Joint Resolution No. 460</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a proposed amendment to the Virginia Constitution that would repeal a same-sex marriage ban that Virginia voters ratified to the constitution in 2006.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that the same proposal  hadn&#8217;t been tried before. Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, sponsored a resolution in the 2021 legislative session to remove the ban – moot since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2015</span><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-556/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Obergefell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legalized gay marriage, and particularly with Congress passing legislation Thursday to protect same-sex and interracial unions – from the state constitution, which was later <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/va-republicans-block-effort-to-scrap-2006-gay-marriage-ban/" target="_blank">blocked by House Republicans</a>. That’s understandable coming from Ebbin, Virginia’s first openly gay legislator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But both of those back-to-back apostasies from you, Tim? You’ve already felt some of the fury from the MAGA right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won your seat narrowly in 2021 over Del. Nancy Dye, D-Virginia Beach, after winning your primary by</span><a href="https://results.elections.virginia.gov/vaelections/2021%20June%20Republican%20Primary/Site/GeneralAssembly.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">two dozen votes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over former Del. Chris Stolle, whose family has a deep GOP pedigree. Chris’s brother Colin is Virginia Beach’s commonwealth’s attorney, brother Ken is the city’s sheriff and was a state senator before that, and sister Siobhan S. Dunnavant represents a Richmond-area Senate district.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You defended Trumpist state Sen. Amanda Chase when senators of both parties censured her for lauding the insurrectionist mob that sacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as “patriots.” You’re a gun store owner and a tireless defender of Second Amendment rights. You’re a lawyer who took a Virginia Beach</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/06/obscenity-suit-exposed-an-outdated-law-and-a-society-too-reliant-on-government-to-raise-kids/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bookstore to court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last summer in an unsuccessful bid to halt its sale of books with sexual content to teens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now?</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Et tu, Brute.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you’re doing is nowhere in the modern candidate’s playbook for a GOP primary. It’s common for one to try and out-Trump or out-right the other to win the nomination and tack toward the center to seem more palatable to a broader electorate in November. So I put the question directly to Anderson last week: What </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">were</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you thinking?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m doing this as I find myself in an incumbent primary,” he said, aware of a possible reckoning ahead. Redistricting by the state Supreme Court last December grouped Anderson in a redrawn 100th House District with Del. Rob Bloxom, R-Accomack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Racing to the moderate side of things [in a primary] is not wise political strategy,” Anderson said in a phone interview. “But there’s more at stake here than my next election, and that’s the future of the Republican Party. What I equate myself as doing is I am seeing smoke and I’m yelling ‘Fire!’ and hoping somebody will listen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His message is that the party is losing Virginia elections because of its ties to Trump and because its focus on hot-button culture war issues turns off people who would otherwise vote Republican.</span> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/oct-13-19-2020-washington-post-schar-school-poll-of-virginia-voters/2be60bb5-dff2-4440-a7c4-af4e42a86c88/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of</span><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/about/news/rc_poll_politics_dec_2022" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">polling</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and election results back him up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Trump’s time running for or inhabiting the White House, Republicans lost every statewide election. It culminated in the loss of both legislative chambers for the first time in 20 years during the 2019 midterms. With Democratic majorities in the House of Delegates and Senate at the start of 2020 and Democrat Ralph Northam in the governor’s office, the GOP was out of power across the board in Richmond for the first time since 1993.  Anderson saw state policy quickly take a sharp leftward turn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that was disastrous for everything we believe as conservatives,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson’s actions have gotten him into tight spots before. In 2016, a federal judge ordered him to take on 15 pro bono legal cases as punishment for</span> <a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/politics/elections/pro-bono-candidate-delegate-virginia/291-e37ecc17-25af-41e6-b566-3942972c5e91" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">impersonating a judge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a phone call to his office. He said he was trying to test whether his firm’s staff was properly prioritizing calls from a bankruptcy court judge, but the real judge wasn’t amused. During his 2021 House run, Anderson posted on his</span> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/timandersonvirginia/posts/350907973102140?amp%3B__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign Facebook page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Virginia didn’t need and should return about $4 billion in federal COVID-19 relief money, only to have the</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/government/virginia/vp-nw-tim-anderson-covid-relief-20210803-baapctr4tbfcrpptzwh2ekli7u-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginian-Pilot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> later report that his businesses accepted almost $750,000 from the same program to help cover payroll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But those missteps didn’t offend Trump’s loyal legions or power-voting Christian conservatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The night before our interview, he said, he attended a GOP event where he encountered open hostility over HJ460. He said many approached him afterward and privately agreed with his classical conservative/libertarian position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I explained to them … that less government, more freedom is the quintessential foundation of conservatism. The bigger the government, the smaller the person; the smaller the government, the bigger the person. That is who we are at our core as Republicans. But the religious right has taken control of the conservative narrative and we are now at a point where if your message does not meet a purist Christian test, then you are a RINO [Republican in name only], you are not a conservative,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I am hoping will come out of this is that the church will find its voice. I am 100% in support of the church screaming from the rooftops that gay marriage is against God’s law and people shouldn’t be doing it and there should be a different path. That is their job. It is not the job of a government that sells licenses to people to get married to discriminate against anybody wanting that license,” Anderson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether Anderson wins his nomination contest with Bloxom is a question the next few months will resolve. But win or lose, he will have nudged his party closer to the Reaganesque values that a healthier, more inclusive and successful GOP once held.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a toll. The economy – specifically inflation – was the top concern of 31% of those who voted in the midterm elections last month, just ahead of abortion at 27%, according to national</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/08/exit-polls-2022-elections/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">exit polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faith in the economy tanked from March through May of 2020 with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. And it was warranted. The deadly new virus to which humans had no acquired immunity and for which we lacked vaccines set off a wave of panic with an apocalyptic feel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospitals were overrun. Unemployment hit levels unseen since the Great Depression. Supply chains disintegrated. Businesses large and small failed, in many cases wiping out families&#8217; livelihoods and savings. Governments imposed moratoria on</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brendarichardson/2020/12/23/fha-extends-foreclosure-and-eviction-relief-for-homeowners/?sh=107f13485c7a" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">foreclosures and evictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the depth of the crisis in hopes of forestalling, if not preventing, massive homelessness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those hit hardest, people on the margins financially, have yet to recover. Federal infusions of cash into the economy provided a safety net of sorts, but those are over and legal protections against evictions are expiring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as a whole, the economy hasn’t done badly, at least as it is reflected in the taxes people pay to Virginia’s treasury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I became a state budget nerd more than two decades ago when I started tracking</span><a href="https://www.finance.virginia.gov/key-documents/master-reports-list/#FY2014" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">monthly revenue summaries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by keying them into a spreadsheet to augment my reporting on Virginia’s finances in the early years of the 21st century. I never intended it to go on and on and on, but it did, and I’ve cataloged that data for every major category of general fund tax collections every month since. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time – 276 months, counting October’s results – those numbers tell some interesting and important stories about Virginia’s booms, busts and everything in between. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, a little background for people who lead interesting lives. Virginia’s whole fiscal kit and caboodle for budgeting purposes consists of</span><a href="https://dpb.virginia.gov/budget/faq.cfm#wherefrom" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">two primary buckets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of revenue: the general fund and the non-general fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">non</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-general fund is the larger of the two, but that money is largely a pass-through, derived from specific sources such as fees, federal grants, fuel taxes, tuition at state-supported colleges, business licenses and profits from the state monopoly on liquor sales, to name just a few. Non-general fund money is already spoken for, earmarked by law for specific uses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">general</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fund underwrites state government operations, which include law enforcement, state employee salaries, state support for local public schools and mental health services. More than two-thirds of it comes from state income taxes. Since the money is discretionary — that is, its specific use isn’t prescribed by law — it causes the General Assembly’s most protracted disputes. This year’s standoff lasted until</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/01/virginia-lawmakers-send-bipartisan-budget-deal-to-youngkin/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">June 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, just four weeks before the previous budget expired at the stroke of midnight on June 30, a</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/virginia-ends-fiscal-year-with-1-9-billion-surplus/article_50a144ac-3768-5822-91f6-c8432878707d.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">record surplus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notwithstanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it’s overwhelmingly drawn from personal income, the general fund is an excellent statistical reflection of the commonwealth’s economic health. The past two fiscal years, which start each July 1 and end the next June 30, have been off the charts after a tepid fiscal 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fiscal years 2021 and 2022, total general fund revenues climbed year over year by 14% and 16%, respectively, after a mere 2% increase for fiscal 2020. The only comparable fiscal year since 2000 was a 15% spike in fiscal 2005, the apex of a white-hot economy fueled by a lusty run-up in the real estate market that collapsed three years later, hurtling the nation into the Great Recession. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hard dollar numbers, however, tell a more convincing story than percentages.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through fiscal 2020, year-over-year general revenue had increased by $1 billion or more just six times this century, the largest being just under $1.8 billion in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2021, however, revenue was $3.1 billion greater than the year before, and in the fiscal year that ended this June, it exceeded fiscal 2021’s total by $4 billion. In both of those years, actual collections obliterated official revenue estimates on which budgeted spending was based.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first quarter of the current fiscal year picked up where fiscal 2022 left off. General tax collections from July through September totaled about $5.6 billion, down slightly from $5.9 billion in the same period the previous year but eclipsing $5 billion for the same quarter three years in a row.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what does this wonky number soup mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry Rephann, a regional economist with the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, suggests that it’s the result of wage inflation. He points to  data presented to the legislature’s budget-writing committees at their annual retreat last month to back him up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wages grew by 9.3% in Virginia in the fiscal year that ended June 30 as businesses large and small struggled to rehire staff lost during the pandemic, the presentation said. Wage growth the previous two fiscal years was 3% and 4.7%, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those collections are known as “withholding” revenues and wage earners recognize them from their pay stubs as the bite already sent off to state and federal governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wild card is the so-called “non-withholding” income taxes paid on capital gains and  by the self-employed on their estimated earnings. A stratospheric stock market drove freakish year-over-year non-withholding increases of 31% for each of the past two fiscal years. Over the previous 21 fiscal years, year-over-year average growth was 6%. The trajectory of the past two years’ non-withholding collections is unsustainable,</span><a href="https://hac.virginia.gov/Committee/files/2022/11-14-22/II_a%20-%20Revenue%20and%20Budget%20Outlook%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the House Appropriations Committee staff warned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So while Virginians make – and tax collectors take – more than ever, how come we feel poorer?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The price of meat, fish and poultry is up 8% over the past 12 months, according to</span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/inflation-update-october/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes Advisor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Electricity is up 14%, natural gas is up 20%, rent is up 7.5%, and fruits and veggies are up 9.3%. And if you just want to get away,</span><a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/charts" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">gasoline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is 50 cents a gallon higher than it was in mid-2021, though down from this summer’s high around $5 a gallon. Airline tickets cost 43% more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wears people down, and it can make an electorate surly. You can earn enough political science degrees to paper a wall and never hear truer, more actionable wisdom than this: “People vote their pocketbooks.” You don’t need exit polls to know that, either.</span></p>

Don McEachin speaks outside the Virginia Capitol. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elevator doors were closing one hot July morning in 1994 and I was about to ascend 13 floors to my office when a large man in the lobby doubled his pace to catch the elevator. I stuck an arm against the door to hold it open a few more seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks,” he said, extending his large right hand to me as the doors shut. “Hi. I’m Don.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the first welcome I had been extended after my move here by a Richmonder other than my new colleagues at The Associated Press, where I had just started work as the Virginia news editor, and the realtor who was helping me find a house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will never forget that introduction. Don was Aston Donald McEachin, who would later become a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, the Democratic nominee for state attorney general, a state senator and a member of Congress. To me, he would always be just Don, a sweet man with a friendly smile, a warm handshake and an innate likeability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then only 33, he was a named partner in the McEachin &amp; Gee law firm one floor directly beneath AP’s main Virginia bureau. There would be many elevator mornings, some shared lunches and discussions about government, the law, society and politics. He was candid about his desire to hold public office and make a qualitative difference. Two years later, in 1996, he won his first term as a delegate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am about 6 feet, 2 inches tall, but Don towered over me. His most impressive trait, however, was his gentleness, his remarkable intellect, his thoughtfulness and his ability to listen, a quality essential to good lawyering, good politics and good friendships. In a conversation, Don focused on the person before him, and it was clear he was drinking in everything he was told.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I heard of Don’s passing Monday at the age of 61 after a long and very public battle with colorectal cancer, it was like a fist to the solar plexus. Beside the shock and the tears clouding my vision, my immediate thought was, “You deserved better, Don.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don had the skills to ascend much higher in public office than a seat in Congress. He had served almost six years in the House of Delegates when his party nominated him in hopes he would become Virginia’s first African American attorney general. Timing and luck had something to do with holding him back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2001 campaign, he seemed the odd man out in a Democratic ticket led by gubernatorial candidate Mark Warner with Tim Kaine running for lieutenant governor. Warner and Kaine won; Don lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No difference between the candidates was clearer than Don’s disdain for Warner’s cozy relations with the National Rifle Association and his promise not to seek new gun restrictions in a state that had voted reflexively Republican for years, depriving Democrats of every lever of statewide political power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don voiced his displeasure at Warner’s closeness to the NRA in a state Capitol news conference with former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, the nation’s first elected Black governor. Going public with such a rift within a ticket would have been enormously damaging but for an ominous quirk of history: It happened as terrorists crashed American Airlines Flight 77 into the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. The explosive presser went unreported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don was a loyal Democrat, but he never let partisan leanings supersede friendships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This one hurts. This one really hurts,” said Bea Gonzales, a state Republican Party staffer before she embarked on a career as a well-regarded Richmond lobbyist. She had forged a friendship with Don and his wife, Colette – Richmond’s commonwealth’s attorney – that became even closer with the birth of Bea’s son, Sebi, and the interest the congressman took in the child. She marked his passing with a Facebook post of a photo of the McEachins holding her infant, now 8, during a dinner years earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I called him a bad-ass teddy bear,” she said. “People think of him as this huge person, (so) he must be mean, he must be angry, and he wasn’t at all. Even as sick as he was, if I had called him and said, ‘I need this for Sebi,’ he would do it. He just would, and so would Colette.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What clearly brought Don fulfillment was identifying promising public servants and helping them embark on promising careers. One such person was Del. Jeff Bourne, D-Richmond, a young lawyer with a desire to serve in elective office as Don had. He remembers him as “a larger-than-life man, but he was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just Don</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Didn’t matter if he was winning multi-million-dollar judgments, whether it was Senator McEachin or Delegate McEachin or Congressman McEachin. It was just Don,” Bourne said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To me, the thing that made him special was the encouragement he always gave to young, aspiring African American community leaders, political leaders, folks who thought they might want to be elected,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don turned up this month at a screening of “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” in Richmond to persuade the mostly Black audience to get checked for colon cancer, the disease that killed “Black Panther” actor Chadwick Boseman and would take his own life less than two weeks later.</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/our-rva/wakanda-forever-richmond-november-16-2022" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He spoke bluntly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the disease that had reduced the strapping hulk of a man I met 28 years ago into a gaunt, gray but still determined public servant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t y’all fool around. Don’t do my journey. Go see a doctor,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not an eloquent epitaph, but it’s powerful, plain, lifesaving counsel given freely to help others. It fits Don perfectly.</span></p>

Terry McAuliffe appointee, listening to a presentation by Jillian Balow, superintendent of public instruction, at the Nov. 17 Board of Education business meeting. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Babe Ruth’s home run record was sure to fall sooner or later. Roger Maris broke Ruth’s 60-homer single-season record with his 61st home run of the 1961 season. Hank Aaron broke Ruth’s career homer record of 714 in 1974 with his 715th career dinger. Now, those broken records have been surpassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow, though, Ruth remains distinct and immortal. Here’s one reason why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the fifth inning of game three in the 1932 World Series at Wrigley Field with the Yankees and Cubs tied 4-4. Ruth had taken two strikes and the Chicago crowd roared as the Cubs dugout taunted him. The Babe pointed to the flagpole beyond centerfield. On the next pitch, a curveball, he hit it exactly where he had pointed – an estimated 50 feet beyond the centerfield fence 440 feet away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ruth made good on his gesture. The Yankees swept the series in four games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Babe didn’t crawl out of the cradle knocking baseballs out of the park. He had the physical gifts, yes, but he took the time to learn the fine points of the game and perfected his ability to terrorize pitchers on the mound 60 feet, six inches away. Maybe there’s a lesson in this for the governor, even though he’s a</span><a href="https://www.ricethresher.org/article/2021/11/owl-to-governor-looking-back-at-governor-elect-glenn-youngkins-college-years" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">basketball guy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, a Republican, won the 2021 governor’s race by positioning himself as a solutions-oriented pragmatist, apart from the snarling nationalism that became his party’s brand during former President Donald Trump’s White House years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He picked the perfect wedge issue, too: public education. Specifically, Youngkin promised to make the concerns and prerogatives of parents a priority among those who set public school policy and curriculum. After the profound pandemic disruptions in 2020-21 and the 2020 summer of racial tumult following George Floyd’s</span><a href="https://youtu.be/xvW6PLIDsbI" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">videotaped curbside murder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a white policeman, Youngkin’s message found resonance not only in Republican rural Virginia but also with households in the centrist suburbs that for years had decisively favored Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He accused schools of indoctrinating students with “</span><a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critical race theory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” a college-level academic concept that every Virginia school division denied teaching. He sided with parents who objected to accommodations that schools were making for transgender students and books with mature themes that were in school libraries or made assigned reading for students. He criticized school district requirements that students wear masks to slow the coronavirus spread when they returned to classrooms from months of remote learning.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The afternoon he took office, Youngkin opened fire on those issues in several of the 11 executive actions he signed. He proclaimed that “woke” instruction was doomed and that the teaching of “inherently divisive concepts” would end once his appointees took over the State Board of Education and could promulgate new curriculum standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of which His Excellency had an absolute right to do. Elections have consequences, and to the victor go the spoils. But a little humility and even more listening and learning go a long way for a layman about to swagger into a minefield as important and complex as statewide education policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two weeks, as</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/17/board-of-ed-delays-first-review-of-new-history-social-science-standards-amid-public-outcry/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the Mercury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/11/17/virginia-history-standards-review/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">other</span></a><a href="https://www.wdbj7.com/2022/11/18/virginia-board-education-delays-action-history-standards/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">outlets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have reported, the governor’s education team has barged into the public school policy arena with hastily drawn revisions to the state’s history/social sciences guidelines and all the grace of an agitated moose in an antique glassware boutique. It hasn’t gone well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The backstory goes like this. Every seven years, the State Board of Education is required to update the minimum expectations for what K-12 public students should learn in documents known as the</span><a href="https://doe.virginia.gov/testing/index.shtml" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Standards of Learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The ponderous, drawn-out process for updating the history standards, begun during the term of Democratic former Gov. Ralph Northam, yielded a</span><a href="https://doe.virginia.gov/boe/meetings/2022/08-aug/item-g-attachment-a.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">402-page tome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the board, once Youngkin’s appointees took charge, returned to state Superintendent Jillian Balow in August for additional work. That revision, guided by an outside education consultant, was just</span><a href="https://doe.virginia.gov/boe/meetings/2022/11-nov/item-i-draft-hss-standards.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">53 pages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it was presented to the board last week, all hell broke loose. In a long public input session during the nearly eight-hour meeting, the new Cliff’s Notes draft was pilloried by teachers, parents, community groups and historians as a “whitewash” of history that glosses over the nation’s fraught racial past and minimizes the contributions and perspectives of marginalized and Indigenous people (euphemized as “America’s first immigrants”) and communities of color.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservatives and parents’ rights advocates warmed to the brief version for its promotion of precepts of the free market and limited government. But not even the Youngkin-friendly new board was on board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/11/17/virginia-history-standards-review/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Youngkin appointee Andy Rotherham moved to postpone reviewing the new standards, noting apparent lapses on some historical topics including the anti-slavery abolition movement. Two-term Democratic appointee Anne Holton, a daughter of a Republican governor and wife to a Democratic one, called the November rewrite “a disaster.” She also noted that President Ronald Reagan is referenced six times in the new draft yet the nation’s first Black president, Barack Obama, is not mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Where we sit today, we are so far away from an established process that I am concerned that we’ve lost our way — quite candidly as a board — in terms of directing what’s supposed to be going on,” Daniel Gecker, the board president, said during the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So now, the board has tasked Balow and the Department of Education with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">re</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-revising the latest revision, restoring some content dropped from the voluminous August draft, correcting typos, omissions and inaccuracies, and assembling a “crosswalk” document that compares and correlates competing drafts. (The Post already published</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/11/16/virginia-school-history-standards-youngkin/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">such a comparison</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the contretemps has escalated. An </span><a href="https://susanwisebauer.com/professional-c-v/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">author</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of books about education who had been a College of William &amp; Mary instructor objected so deeply to being characterized as an expert who had been consulted on the latest standards draft that she</span><a href="https://twitter.com/susanwisebauer/status/1593984222926196738?s=46&amp;t=07oZhcu4JaDBzjSpYJ8AxA" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">took to Twitter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to warn of litigation if the claim wasn’t retracted and her very limited role clarified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a serious need for comprehensive, accurate, quality instruction in history, for thoroughgoing studies into the society we share and for baseline training in American civics – how our democratic republic works. </span><a href="https://doe.virginia.gov/news/news_releases/2022/8-18-22-sol-results-corrected.docx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest SOL scores</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show how far our students&#8217; knowledge of those essential American disciplines has slid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of students in the past school year who passed history and social studies SOL exams declined 14% overall from pre-pandemic levels, with steeper drops for marginalized and economically disadvantaged groups. In a nation founded on the premise of an informed, self-governing electorate, there is clear urgency behind the task of restoring comprehensive, first-rate instruction for new generations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor, gaining at least a baseline awareness of what you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">don’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> know before you go to bat can spare you a lot of embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Bambino stood at the plate 90 years ago in Chicago, stared down the Cubs’ pitcher and brazenly pointed to the centerfield flagpole, he’d been there before and knew exactly what to do. The rest is baseball lore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But perhaps</span><a href="https://www.azquotes.com/author/12792-Bill_Russell?p=2" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">some wisdom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from basketball and arguably its greatest practitioner, Bill Russell, would best serve the governor: “We overreached our decision power. Sometimes our decisions have to fit the reality of the outside world.”</span></p>

(Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t another anti-gun tirade, though I have every reason and urge to launch into one after Sunday’s cold-blooded killings of three University of Virginia football players.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suffice it to say more convincing voices than mine have made those arguments better and more abundantly than I ever could, sadly to little discernible effect. Guns still flood our streets, too often in the hands of people wholly unfit to possess them. Most evenings, shootings lead local TV newscasts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What gripped me was learning that the suspect in the slaying of UVA wide receivers Devin Chandler and Lavel Davis Jr. and linebacker D’Sean Perry on a chartered bus that had just returned to the university after a field trip to Washington is a former teammate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rage so overwhelming that it drives people to address grievances by pointing a loaded firearm at an adversary and squeezing the trigger is foreign, though</span> <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/05/us/brian-robinson-shooting-suspects-arrested#:~:text=Washington%20Commanders%20running%20back%20Brian,August%20during%20an%20attempted%20robbery.&amp;text=Two%20teens%20were%20arrested%20this,NFL%20player%20Brian%20Robinson%20Jr." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not unheard of</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the world of football. As the rampage at Virginia Tech proved so tragically in 2007 and as shootings this year at </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/us/bridgewater-college-shooting-wednesday/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bridgewater College</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in a residential neighborhood near </span><a href="https://www.wtkr.com/news/hospital-lockdown-lifted-after-7-shot-in-norfolk-mass-shooting-other-incidents" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old Dominion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> illustrate, colleges certainly aren’t immune either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What gives rise to such unchecked fury? How can it fester – sometimes unrecognized or unreported and too often untreated – for months or even years until it explodes with deadly force from the muzzle of a gun?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s been little authoritative or detailed reporting about the circumstances that allegedly drove the accused, Christopher Darnell Jones Jr., to such anger. His father said in</span><a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2022/11/15/i-still-cant-believe-it-father-uva-shooting-suspect-speaks/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">television</span></a><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/uva-shooting-suspects-father-november-14-2022" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">interviews</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that his son was “really paranoid” the last time he saw him and that “some people were picking on him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">University officials said Jones had been linked to an investigation in relation to a hazing incident, but that the matter was dropped because unspecified witnesses refused to cooperate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s incumbent on UVA to make public the fullest possible accounting of all that it knew or was investigating about Jones during his time at the university. It’s going to come out anyway as the criminal case against Jones and possibly civil lawsuits are litigated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if there are lessons to be learned from the immediate past that can save lives in the future, the whole story should be disclosed sooner rather than later. The announcement Thursday by Attorney General Jason Miyares that he will appoint </span><a href="https://www.oag.state.va.us/media-center/news-releases/2491-november-17-2022-attorney-general-miyares-commences-external-review-at-the-request-of-the-university-of-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a special counsel to investigate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> events leading to the killings is a step in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same appeal for transparency was made 15 and a half years ago after Virginia Tech student Seung-Hui Cho shot 32 people dead after leaving a trail of largely ignored signs of the hatred that boiled within until he acted out his sick fantasies one cold April morning. Those details remained tightly held until they emerged in</span><a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/mass-shootings-virginia-tech-april-16-2007-report-review-panel" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by a special commission then-Gov. Tim Kaine empaneled to investigate how Cho slipped through the safety net. It led to legislative reforms regarding the state’s woebegone</span> <a href="https://www.roanoke.com/archive/governor-signs-virginia-tech-inspired-mental-health-reform-bills/article_cee1c59b-7176-584e-a48f-749eddc74931.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">behavioral health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system and</span> <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/virginia-tech-shootings-spurred-campus-safety-measures/article_22bc0a06-419b-5322-982b-55667bcc84cb.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campus security</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> protocols. Those security provisions had put Jones</span> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/11/14/christopher-darnell-jones-uva-gunman/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the radar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of UVA officials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, more must be known about those amorphous hazing claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hazing serves no useful purpose. It has no place in modern life, particularly not in academic settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, a Virginia Commonwealth University student died of alcohol poisoning in a fraternity hazing incident. The university recently entered a nearly $1 million negotiated</span> <a href="https://news.vcu.edu/article/2022/09/oakes-family-vcu-agree-to-create-national-model-for-fraternity-and-sorority-life" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">settlement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the family of 19-year-old freshman Adam Oakes. His parents said their son was handed a bottle of whiskey at an off-campus frat house and told to drink it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four men </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/four-men-convicted-of-manslaughter-hazing-in-vsu-drowning-deaths/article_4bed243f-aa5b-505e-9033-44e36e62ce3d.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were convicted</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2015 on charges related to the 2013 drowning of two Virginia State University students in the Appomattox River during an initiation ritual for a group not sanctioned by the university.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I underwent hazing tied to my football team membership in high school and later in college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High school was more abusive – a gauntlet of blows with fists rained upon a player’s back as he crawled down the aisle of a school bus on the trip home after a road game. I bore livid bruises for weeks in silence. People have served jail time for lesser assaults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I entered the lettermen’s club at the University of Mississippi, “hell week” included Tabasco sauce and garlic juice sprinkled indiscriminately upon one’s person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My high school alma mater ended its barbaric ritual during my time there. Ole Miss banned the M-Club ritual in the mid-1970s – as I was going through it – after fisticuffs between two inebriated teammates during a hazing event at an Oxford tavern landed one of them in the hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The desire to avenge hazing indignities or injuries could (and did) lead to fistfights, but no one turned to the lethal use of powder and lead to settle the score.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What changed? The ready availability of guns? A culture that fetishizes their impulsive use against other humans? Peer pressure? Social media algorithms coded to</span> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tristan-harris-social-media-political-polarization-60-minutes-2022-11-06/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amplify angry, antagonistic posts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">? The deterioration of family structures where those harboring rage or mental illness might find refuge and help?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most likely, combinations of those, says the American Psychological Association, cautioning that gun violence is a complex, urgent and multifaceted problem. There is no single profile that reliably predicts who will harm himself or others with a gun, according to a</span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/reports/gun-violence-prevention" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2013 APA report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> titled “Gun Violence: Prediction, Prevention and Policy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study said developmental issues as well as gender and culture are “antecedents to gun violence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Youth gun violence is often sensationalized and misunderstood by the general public, in part because of increasingly public acts of violence and related media coverage,” its authors wrote. Gun violence, they continued, “is associated with a confluence of individual, family, school, peer, community, and sociocultural risk factors that interact over time during childhood and adolescence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study notes that males predominantly commit gun crimes, and that interventions to repair warped “perceptions among males of social norms about behaviors</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and characteristics associated with masculinity” might help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has had plenty of bloodshed, too many after-action reports that gather dust and lots of chances to better prepare and equip its mental health system to identify and heal those who are a threat to themselves and others. Reforms inspired by the Virginia Tech massacre and by the</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nowhere-to-go-mentally-ill-youth-60-minutes/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2014 stabbing attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on state Sen. R. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, by his son, who was in the grips of a mental health crisis, forged a sound blueprint that state agencies have struggled to execute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, three of UVA’s brightest stars — young athletes and promising young men — lie lifeless as two other students recover from their gunshot wounds because … </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m still waiting for someone to explain </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that led to this awful moment.</span></p>
<p><em>This story has been clarified to note that shootings happened near ODU, not on the campus. No students were injured.</em></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elections have a clarifying, refreshing effect. Whether at the local, state or national level, an election authoritatively settles things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A nation whipsawed and left on edge for months on end at last gets relief from a hyperventilating, self-contradicting media, venomous political ads, and pundits who know nothing and race to the nearest microphone to discuss public polls that are little better than guesswork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is how it’s going to be,” the electoral majority, the ultimate decider in our democratic republic, decrees every November (at least in Virginia).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aftermath of each election is a time for introspection, a moment to ponder what the voters have said and what it means. We see which ideas and candidates were validated and which weren’t. The task is to look behind the election results and figure out what they tell us, to distinguish why winners won and losers lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s my take on it, at least on the results in our commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">LOSER: The political extremes – the MAGAverse and its progenitor, Donald Trump, and the Democratic far-left fringe</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at who won.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, defeated two-term Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria without the former president’s help, though she supported failed legislation to spend $70 million on MAGA-esque measures to ferret out gauzy, unsubstantiated fears of election fraud. Trump</span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Endorsements_by_Donald_Trump#2022" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsed five Virginia GOP House candidates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this year’s midterms, and Kiggans was not among them. It didn’t hurt that Kiggans was in a newly redrawn GOP-friendly district, but she ran her campaign on traditional Republican values.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another winner was Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. She won a third term in a redrawn 7th District as a consistent critic of Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the “woke left.” She won a close race against Republican Yesli Vega, a Trump-endorsed former sheriff’s deputy who never touted Trump’s blessing but advanced MAGA talking points and</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/21/vega-kiggans-win-gop-primaries-in-virginias-battleground-districts/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">campaigned with</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trump toady Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, that makes Virginia’s silent, sensible middle perhaps this week’s biggest </span><strong>WINNER</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Election after election, the commonwealth’s voters state resoundingly that Virginia is for lovers, not extremists.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">WINNER: Women and women’s rights</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the more nuanced about-faces seen in the 2022 election cycle was watching as talking heads’ conventional wisdom morphed on the effect of the Supreme Court’s</span><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/19-1392" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dobbs decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that ended 49 years of federal legal protections for abortion. In the furor when the draft opinion was leaked in May (and made official in late June), it was hailed as the driver of a blue wave election. By Election Day, however, the cable news chattering classes had subordinated it to inflation, the economy and crime as key factors that would produce a red tsunami.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth, as usual, was lost in the middle. The economy – particularly a troubled one – always figures heavily into elections, and it did this week. Bill Clinton’s political guru, James Carville, crystallized that political certainty in the 1992 presidential election with the campaign’s guiding mantra, “It’s the economy, stupid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was the primary motivator for 31% of those surveyed in Tuesday’s</span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-elections/exit-polls" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">national exit polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it wasn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the economy. Dobbs was a close second at 27%. That was particularly true for women, who were 52% of those who voted Tuesday. They backed Democrats by a ratio of 53% to 45%. Only 11% said crime was their top issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, voters in Michigan and GOP-leaning Kentucky approved statewide ballot issues protecting the right to abortions in those states, just as Kansas voters did in August. In Virginia, Vega was tied to Republican zeal for banning abortions, in some cases without exceptions for rape, incest and to save a woman’s life. Then she doubled down on it by</span><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1541379792246902784" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">expressing doubt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about pregnancies resulting from rape.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">LOSER: Gov. Glenn Youngkin</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only did two of the three House candidates for whom he campaigned lose very expensive elections, but he stumped for several Trump-loyal 2020 election deniers in governor’s races. That included defeated Republicans Lee Zeldin in New York, Tudor Dixon in Michigan and Paul LePage in Maine. Another, Kari Lake, trailed her Democratic opponent, Katie Hobbs, by about half a percentage point in Arizona’s gubernatorial race with 30% of the vote yet uncounted Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He risked a lot of political capital in this election cycle campaigning for, in some cases, election deniers (and) right-wing extremists,” said Mark Rozell, a political scientist and dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He had established himself as a Trump-alternative Republican who still had the ability to secure the Trump base vote, but increasingly by his actions as governor and now the candidates he campaigned for outside of Virginia, he has established himself as a MAGA-friendly Republican,” Rozell said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">WINNER: Virginia’s clean, fair and secure elections</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t that this week’s election was perfect. There were snafus in a few precincts, as there are in every election where imperfect humans and technological gremlins are a factor. But there have been no claims of massive fraud and no reports of systemic voter intimidation and bullying at polling places</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/us/politics/election-monitors-arizona-judge.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">of the kind we saw elsewhere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Virginia’s voters voted and the vote counters counted, the losers conceded defeat, the orderly transition of power remained on track, and the will of the people was respected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that any of that will matter to conspiracy-mongers who sow discord and suspicion absent evidence to back their claims for their own dark, anti-democratic purposes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, I’ve closely watched Virginia’s elections – with all their minor blemishes – and the thousands of ordinary people who give their time to work at polling precincts, faithfully enabling fellow Virginians to vote. It’s the most noble and uplifting thing I have covered in my life in political journalism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a shame that this is even a discussion point. But memories of the 2020 election and its dystopian aftermath culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection attempt are still fresh.</span></p>

(Nathaniel Cline / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><strong>1966 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As LBJ and Democrats’ historic grip on the South slips, the GOP gains two of Virginia’s 10 House seats, cutting Dems’ majority from 8-2 to 6-4 and beginning a multiyear upward trajectory for Republicans. </span></p>
<p><strong>1970 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">– A </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-seat gain gives the GOP its first delegation majority (6-4) since Reconstruction. It lasts 16 years. </span></p>
<p><b>1974 </b><b>– </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A two-seat Democratic gain in the first election after Watergate wipes out the 7-3 GOP edge gained in Nixon’s landslide 1972 re-election for a 5-5 split.</span></p>
<p><b>1978 </b><b>–</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 6-4 edge the GOP won in the 1976 Carter presidential election year remains unchanged.</span></p>
<p><b>1982 </b><b>— </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats take back three seats from a 9-1 GOP delegation at the height of its power with Reagan’s election.</span></p>
<p><strong>1986 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP’s hold weakens in Reagan’s second term. The delegation returns to  a 5-5 split.</span></p>
<p><strong>1990 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats gain one seat, winning a majority they will hold until 2000. </span></p>
<p><b>1994 </b><b>– </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP gains one seat in Clinton’s first midterm, dropping the Democrats’ edge from 7-4 to 6-5. (Virginia gained an 11th congressional seat in 1992.) </span></p>
<p><b>1998 </b><b>–</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The 6-5 Republican  advantage holds.</span></p>
<p><strong>2002 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a rare midterm rout by a party in the White House (G.W. Bush), the GOP wins three seats to secure an 8-3 majority.  </span></p>
<p><b>2006 </b><b>– </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 8-3 GOP majority is unchanged in Bush’s difficult second midterm.</span></p>
<p><strong>2010 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Tea Party GOP gains three seats in Obama’s first midterm, retaking the delegation majority, 8-3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>2014</strong> – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 8-3 GOP majority holds.</span></p>
<p><strong>2018 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">–</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dems gain three seats in Trump’s disastrous midterm to take a 7-4 delegation majority.</span></p>
<p><strong>2022 </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">– </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A possible crimson tide is little more than a ripple. A one-seat GOP gain trims Dems’ edge to 6-5. </span></p>

L. Douglas Wilder. (Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It amuses new generations of Virginians who see the commonwealth’s Democratic 66th governor, L. Douglas Wilder, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/WdVhptjcBpA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">get all lovey-dovey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the Republican 74th governor, Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps also perplexing: As Wilder warms to Youngkin, he has become an </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/wilder-governor-needs-to-get-involved-in-solving-richmond-crime-issues/article_63468317-8c0c-581b-ad5f-722bbd80af47.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unabashed critic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of fellow Democrat Levar Stoney, who holds Wilder’s old job as mayor of Richmond and aspires to another of Wilder’s former titles: governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We who have followed the nation’s first elected Black governor for decades have seen it all before. Wilder loves to frustrate those who try to predict his actions. He is to politics what Madonna has been to pop culture the past 40 years: ever changing, never boring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As fellow scribe Jeff Schapiro of the Richmond Times-Dispatch once observed when we were both members of the Capitol press corps: “Doug is chemically dependent on printer’s ink.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another well-worn bromide among the political media back in the day: “The only thing more dangerous than being Doug’s enemy is being Doug’s friend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t believe that’s always true, but taking his allegiance for granted is always risky. If you’re in Virginia politics and you haven’t at some point found yourself crossways with Wilder, you likely haven’t been at it long or haven’t accomplished much.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t look at it as politicians being crossways with me, I look at it as being crossways with the people. People feel like they have no voice,” Wilder said in a conversation last week, his populist streak still vibrant more than a decade removed from his last stint in public office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilder does what he wants when he wants, unbothered by party leaders who long ago gave up trying to persuade him to toe the party line. Consistently contrarian, Wilder – who turns 92 in January – relishes his stature as an elder statesman, a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gubernator emeritus</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who can speak his mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that he was ever bashful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take 1994, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb – like Wilder, a former Virginia governor – was seeking a second term with his once-polished reputation badly scuffed by</span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-19941016-1994-10-16-9410160012-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">various allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of conduct unbecoming a governor, including an</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1991/09/05/tai-collins-in-the-flesh/e70a9e4e-b9c0-48c2-9cc7-7a71b5d1af26/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">alleged sexual affair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a former Miss Virginia/USA. He was also brought before a federal grand jury investigating how his office obtained a recording of an</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/06/07/charles-s-robb-the-unmaking-of-a-politician/23a8f22f-a874-400b-aae7-b8abd5bc6ea2/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">illegally intercepted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> private cell phone call to which Wilder was a party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilder challenged Robb’s bid for reelection to a second Senate term, running as an independent. In a bitter campaign in which Robb at one point faced not only Wilder but Republican Oliver North and conservative independent Marshall Coleman, Wilder at times seemed to revel in doing North’s job for him, needling Robb in televised debates and on the campaign trail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Name me three things Chuck Robb has done for Virginia,” Wilder would say to reporters on the campaign trail in the summer of 1994, challenging them to respond.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Wilder withdrew from the race and, late in the campaign, endorsed Robb. Larry O’Dell, an Associated Press colleague of mine, covered the ballyhooed endorsement announcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As everyone was leaving, he saw me and came over and said hello,” O’Dell recalled in a phone call last week. “So, I said, ‘Governor, let me ask you something you’ve been asking us now for several weeks: Name me three things Chuck Robb has done for Virginia.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilder laughed it off and quickly slid into the back seat of a car that arrived right on cue to whisk him away without answering O’Dell’s question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven years later, Wilder was the star of perhaps the most consequential news conference of the first Virginia governor’s race of the 21st century, one that could have riven the Democratic ticket. He was fed up with Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mark Warner’s cozy relations with the National Rifle Association, which Warner had persuaded not to endorse his Republican foe. The NRA had been a tireless adversary of Virginia’s one-handgun-a-month law, a signature policy triumph of Wilder’s term. So one sunny morning, Wilder turned up alongside Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Donald McEachin at a state Capitol news conference and bluntly called out what he considered Warner’s apostasy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This reminds me of the tryst between the monkey and the skunk where the monkey says, ‘I have enjoyed as much of this as I can </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stand</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">!’” Wilder said, his voice indignant and climbing in volume and octaves as he spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seconds later, the event was upstaged by news bulletins about an attack on the Pentagon 100 miles to the north that morning — Sept. 11, 2001. The press conference dissolved in chaos. If a story was written about the presser, it never saw the light of day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partisan boundaries don’t deter Wilder. Over the years, he has found ways to keep political friends and foes alike guessing, often until the dramatic last moment. He could stand with his party one moment, then side with Republicans on another issue the next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilder endorsed Warner’s bid for governor, and Warner, early in his term, appointed Wilder to chair a blue-ribbon commission to recommend ways to make state government more effective and efficient. Two years later, Wilder was reprising GOP talking points in questioning Warner’s proposal to reform state tax laws that left state revenue collections short of their budgeted targets during difficult economic times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What drives Wilder today? He’s made his last run for elective office. His groundbreaking place in history is secure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today … people feel powerless. And as soon as someone recognizes them and has a platform, then they take these slogans and they run with them. ‘Black lives matter.’ Sure. All lives matter. ‘Defund the police.’ Are you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">crazy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And then you’ve got Stoney and the (City) Council talking about paying $55,000 to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">violence interrupters</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Now, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a violence interrupter?” he said with an incredulous laugh. “Is that a new name for a snitch?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He always comes back to the issue of voice, of being heard. Is he referring to himself being heard? Is he talking about the greater </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">vox populi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having known and covered this engaging and enigmatic man for almost 30 years, my best guess is a little of both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But my guidance for Millennials and Gen Xers now in full adulthood who marvel at the historical, walking paradox that is Doug Wilder is to understand this: Nobody’s ever muzzled him, and nobody ever will.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – This is a city accustomed to big league politics. The legacy of former Arkansas Gov.-turned-President Bill Clinton is ubiquitous: libraries, schools, streets bearing his name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Arkansas has major statewide elections, including those for a U.S. Senate seat and governor. Yard signs sprout like dandelions from almost every parcel of real estate in its capital city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, by contrast, has no statewide headline-grabbers, though there are some nail-biter congressional races. The 2nd and 7th Congressional Districts are anybody’s guess as Republicans, riding a wave of momentum, have targeted Democratic representatives in those swing districts. Things are getting interesting in the 10th District as well, a district in the Washington suburbs and exurbs where the Democratic incumbent should have an edge but where the Republican challenger has mounted a formidable campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This commonwealth draws a bye on statewide races. This is the one even-numbered year in every six in which there is no U.S. Senate race. And Virginia elects its governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in odd-numbered years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Arkansas has more marquee contests, odds are that voters in Virginia are more knowledgeable and engaged in the few races in which they will vote in eight days than Arkansans will be,</span><a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/most-least-politically-engaged-states/7782" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by fintech services provider WalletHub suggests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study ranks Virginia as the nation’s third most politically engaged state, trailing first-place Maryland and second-place New Jersey, according to its broad-based analysis of multiple metrics and political and election data. The information was drawn from independent, nonprofit research organizations such as OpenSecrets.org, the Center for Responsive Politics, U.S. Census data, Ballotpedia, AmeriCorps, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Thomas B. Fordham Institute and the job-search website Indeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arkansas sits on the opposite end of the spectrum: 50th in average political engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why the enormous gulf between Virginia and her Deep South sister and other states less civically or politically attuned?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The obvious built-in advantage for both Virginia and neighboring Maryland is their proximity to the seat of national government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington is a company town, and politics is the company. Business is brisk 24/7/365, and it never knows a recession, or even a bear market. That imperative  spills over abundantly into neighboring Virginia and Maryland. As in D.C., situational awareness is a prerequisite for the broad array of business that is tied to Uncle Sam in these two states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consider how many people work in government or for companies that do work for the government,” said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The percentage of people in the public sector in Virginia is probably higher than anywhere else, and it’s not just in Northern Virginia, but also in Hampton Roads with the military and veterans,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But being astute about government is not confined to the state’s most populous areas. In every region of Virginia, voters keep close track of issues that affect their communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over many years of traveling Virginia and covering politics in areas as diverse as remote southwestern counties, the leafy suburbs of Arlington, Southside’s struggling former mill towns and Navy-dominated Norfolk, I found people conversant with not only their own political and governmental issues but those making news in Richmond and in Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also helps that voters in Virginia (and New Jersey) have more experience with elections. Ours is one of only a handful of states that hold general elections every November. Even-numbered years are for elections for federal offices – Congress and the presidency. Virginia reserves odd-numbered years for state government elections: the House of Delegates every other year; races for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general as well as the state Senate every four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only four states – Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia – will hold state elections</span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/State_legislative_elections,_2023" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Virginia will elect new state senators and delegates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s meaningful from the perspective of engagement that Virginia holds elections every year,” said Kyle Kondik, the director of communications for the University of Virginia Center for Politics and managing editor of “Sabato’s Crystal Ball.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turnout for elections in Virginia – particularly the one next week with no statewide races on the ballot – pales alongside that for presidential-year elections, yet Virginians are showing up in impressive numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2020 elections, the 4.5 million Virginians who voted shattered the state’s record for turnout in any election, with an increase of 13% over the 3.9 million who voted in the presidential race four years earlier – the year Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., was his party’s  vice-presidential nominee. The 3.6 million votes cast in the gubernatorial election last November was a 26% dropoff from the 2020 turnout, but it obliterated the previous record turnout for a governor’s race (2.6 million in 2017) by 25%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this year,</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/early-voting/2022-november-general-election/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">early voting figures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compiled by the Virginia Public Access Project suggest a turnout even larger than that seen in the 2018 “blue wave” midterm election that put Democrats in control of Congress and gave the party seven of Virginia’s 11 U.S. House seats. As of Oct. 26, Virginians had cast 473,735 early ballots either in person or by mail, compared with 344,594 who voted early in the 2018 midterms, an increase of more than one-third, but the liberalized early voting measures Virginians enjoy now were not in place then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other factors that figure into the study’s measurement of political engagement included education and income.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=state-by-state%20education&amp;tid=ACSST1Y2021.S1501" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> U.S. Census Bureau educational attainment data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released this year, Virginia ranks eighth nationally in the percentage of people aged 25 or older who have at least a four-year college degree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=70&amp;step=1&amp;acrdn=2#eyJhcHBpZCI6NzAsInN0ZXBzIjpbMSwyNCwyOSwyNSwzMSwyNiwyNywzMF0sImRhdGEiOltbIlRhYmxlSWQiLCIyMSJdLFsiQ2xhc3NpZmljYXRpb24iLCJOb24tSW5kdXN0cnkiXSxbIk1ham9yX0FyZWEiLCIwIl0sWyJTdGF0ZSIsWyIwIl1dLFsiQXJlYSIsWyJYWCJdXSxbIlN0YXRpc3RpYyIsWyItMSJdXSxbIlVuaXRfb2ZfbWVhc3VyZSIsIkxldmVscyJdLFsiWWVhciIsWyIyMDIxIl1dLFsiWWVhckJlZ2luIiwiLTEiXSxbIlllYXJfRW5kIiwiLTEiXV19" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ranks the commonwealth 14th nationally in per capita personal income and 13th among states in gross domestic product for the second quarter of 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s one more category that reckoned prominently in the rankings and gives Virginia a powerful edge over most any other state: how much money it pumps into political campaigns and committees. That’s where our </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">un</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">commonwealth, with only about 8 million people, punches above its weight. We rank seventh behind the likes of California, Texas, New York and Florida, according to</span><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/totals-by-state?cycle=2020" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">OpenSecrets.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You expect Republicans to go after Democrats. And vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s what they do. Like a mongoose and a cobra. Or the Red Sox and the Yankees. They don’t like each other. It’s the natural order of things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the 2023 state legislative races, still more than a year away, have generated Republican-on-Republican aggression that’s remarkable by any accounting. And it’s happening as Republicans prepare for nationally prominent midterm</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/29/virginia-heads-into-the-fall-as-a-barometer-for-u-s-house-control/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">congressional races</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year in two pivotal Virginia districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Southwestern Virginia, bad blood developed between two Republican members of the House of Delegates shortly after the state’s independent redistricting commission lumped Republican Dels. Wren Williams of Patrick County and Marie March of Floyd County into the redrawn</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/house-of-delegates-47/district/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">House District 47</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things came to a head in September when Williams and March, both ardent disciples of former President Donald Trump, attended the same GOP event in Wytheville. That’s where, March alleges, Williams deliberately bumped into her and sent her stumbling backward as he and his wife were leaving the event. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">March, who was not injured, called the cops. And from there it became a literal he-said-she-said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She claims Williams had been needling her the whole evening, culminating in the forceful contact. She even reenacted the moment for the officers who were dispatched to investigate her complaint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams said he barely and unintentionally brushed against March without even realizing whom he had touched, and apologized to her forthwith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each has witnesses who have vouched for his or her account in the dispute. The only</span><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/contention-concern-surround-march-williams-nomination-process/article_fd77e284-4684-11ed-a11d-df152f893e10.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of whatever actually happened, from a security camera in the meeting facility, is so blurry and so distant that it’s inconclusive. It was obtained and published by the </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2022/09/26/surveillance-video-of-march-williams-incident-doesnt-show-confrontation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardinal News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A court hearing on the complaint is scheduled for Nov. 21 in Wytheville, where, perhaps, some clarity might be achieved, although the internecine quarrel is unlikely to be salved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side of the commonwealth in Strasburg, fraternal feuding broke out recently between Republicans Dave LaRock, a House of Delegates member, and Lance Allen, who made an unsuccessful bid for the lieutenant governor nomination last year. Like March and Williams, they are both trying to out-MAGA each other in their battle for the GOP nomination to run for a legislative seat they both desire:</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/state-senate-1/district/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate District 1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allen claims that LaRock crashed his campaign’s Oct. 6 screening of “2,000 Mules,” right-wing filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza’s bid to prop up the abundantly discredited claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/lanceforva/posts/pfbid0QXHDxjTj6M2m13YUdJ1CZnRYvpjciE2eZV8oaP7MKoj58goYT2TrS8CLLyi4vL56l" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a statement Allen posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Facebook, he said LaRock had been told he could attend as a member of the public but not as a candidate. LaRock showed up, Allen wrote, and “decided to ignore the rules set by the host and began campaigning as soon as he arrived.” He said LaRock tried to place campaign signs around the event venue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He contends LaRock told him in advance of the screening that he planned to come campaign, “and that if I wanted to have him removed, I&#8217;d have to ‘call the local sheriff,’ and that&#8217;s what I did.” Deputies arrived and removed LaRock, Allen said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not surprisingly, LaRock saw the event differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="https://thevirginiastar.com/2022/10/08/at-campaign-event-lance-allen-calls-law-enforcement-on-del-dave-larock/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=46c28860-7ee3-47dc-9346-a22dc069c96e" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the incident published by The Virginia Star, LaRock “did not campaign at the event,” said Daniel Davies, LaRock’s legislative aide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. Allen blocked the door and would not allow Del. LaRock to get in,” Davies is quoted as saying. “He was outside the building, never even entered the event.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Differences between candidates of the same party haven’t always gotten so raw and contentious that police have had to be called to intervene. But that’s the way it is and the way it’s likely to stay, according to people who research such trends in politics for a living.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia Republicans have come a long way from the days when congressmen who were redistricted into the same district as another Republican simply stepped aside for more senior members of Congress, as George Allen did 30 years ago,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science and international affairs at the University of Mary Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Allen (no relation to Lance) won a special election to succeed U.S. Rep. French Slaughter in 1991 but chose not to seek reelection a year later after a Democratic-controlled General Assembly put him into the 7th District with longtime Republican Congressman Tom Bliley. Rather than create a divisive intraparty spectacle, Allen focused on a longshot 1993 gubernatorial bid in which he stunned politicos by beating the presumptive favorite, Democratic Attorney General Mary Sue Terry, in a rout. In 2000, he won a U.S. Senate term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the heat in the Williams/March skirmish may arise from the fact legislative seats in their Republican-friendly region of the state became scarcer in last year’s reapportionment, Farnsworth said. That’s because of significant population shifts from rural to suburban areas over the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s another reason that party members seem to have embraced open season on one another in a Republican Party that increasingly self-segregates itself between MAGA warriors and more moderate traditionalists whom they deride as “Republicans in name only,” or RINOs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In part, it’s the Trump effect,” said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University. “The former president has unleashed a kind of political furor as a way of elevating himself, and some others in the party emulate that behavior.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an increasingly tribal society, there’s decreasing room for accord or accommodation, particularly in politics. The increased polarization has given rise to behavior that was once considered outside acceptable norms, Rozell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People who disagree have begun to look at the opposition as the enemy of the people and a danger to the republic rather than people with principled disagreements that can be discussed and debated substantively,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until there’s an electoral downside to that sort of brass-knuckled, grievance-mongering politics, don’t look for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farnsworth gets somewhat philosophical about uncivil candidate discourse and its corrosion of our civil society. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People get the politicians they deserve. If you want a better quality of character in public life, then it’s necessary to vote accordingly,” he said. “Taking character more seriously in public figures is a recipe for improved polity. But that doesn’t mean it’s a likely outcome in these times.”</span></p>

(Ørsted)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine you’re going into a pitch meeting to outline a proposal that could put your prospective client years ahead in its industry and be worth millions in consulting and development fees for your own firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a can’t miss project, you tell the client. Once it’s up and running, you can enjoy not only market dominance but a favorable reputation as you lock in healthy, long-term revenues off a readily available but scarcely exploited commodity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Great,” the client exclaims. “So let’s figure out some reasonable performance metrics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The room falls silent. You could hear a gnat burp. Slack-jawed stares from your side of the conference table toward the prospective customers on the other side of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Pardon me?” you stutter incredulously. “You actually want us to say in writing what we’re going to do and then be held accountable on how well we actually do it? You </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be serious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now imagine how quickly that meeting and the deal would collapse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not dissimilar from the position that Dominion, Virginia’s dominant electric power utility is taking with the State Corporation Commission’s attachment of a performance standard to the company’s $9.8 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s Dominion insisting on a heads-I-win,-tails-you-lose approach to its ballyhooed green energy initiative. It involves anchoring 850-feet-tall wind turbines to the sea floor miles off the Virginia coast. The steady sea winds would turn the turbines and generate electricity that is fed through cables along the ocean floor onto land and the nation’s increasingly hungry power grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the build-out goes smoothly and the project is wildly successful, then Dominion shareholders profit. But without the performance agreement, if things go south, the ratepayers, not the shareholders, will cover the utility’s bad bet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Downside risk? That’s for suckers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a tactic would be a nonstarter in the normal course of business. But remarkably, it might just work for a too-big-to-fail utility once accustomed to throwing its weight around and getting its way with government. Whether it flies this time is for the SCC to decide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC holds sweeping regulatory authority over a number of companies and industries that serve essential public functions in Virginia, including utilities. It imposed the performance standard as a condition of approving Dominion’s CVOW project in August. The standard requires the utility, not its customers, to cover the cost of buying replacement energy should the wind farm not produce enough electricity over time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is having none of it. The utility asked the SCC to reconsider the standard, citing “untenable costs.” As the Mercury’s</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/03/va-regulators-to-rule-on-whether-offshore-wind-performance-requirement-should-stay/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Charlie Paullin reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a week ago, Dominion’s most recent argument to the SCC came after several environmental groups, the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares and the planet’s largest retailer, Walmart, argued for the performance standard to stay in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fairness, there’s a whole lot more involved in turning sea winds into megawatts than appearances may suggest. As former Mercury editor Robert Zullo</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/05/for-offshore-wind-aspirations-to-become-reality-transmission-hurdles-must-be-cleared/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">explained in a story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week, pumping the extra current generated at sea into the grid is no plug-and-play operation. Major reconfigurations on land that will cost many billions of dollars have to be made to handle and distribute the power coming into the system from offshore wind farms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion also rightly notes natural and human-made vulnerabilities to offshore wind generating and transmission capabilities. There are also future public policy and market conditions that can affect the bottom line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement to the Mercury for this column, Dominion said the SCC’s accountability measure “creates an unprecedented layer of financial one-way risk to DEV (Dominion Energy Virginia). And it is inconsistent with the utility risk profile expected by our investors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s the tell: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">investors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is a private business obligated to its investors. I probably have a little Dominion stock in my portfolio. So I hope all of us investors fare well. Dominion and its shareholders have experienced both</span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/D/financials/annual/income-statement" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ups and downs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past few years. Who hasn’t? That’s part of investing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Dominion is also a regulated public utility that receives significant governmental protections many companies can never enjoy because it exists to fulfill an essential public need, namely supplying households and businesses with electrical power, something it generally does pretty well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The customers who Dominion serves and who pay its ever-higher bills face “risk profiles” every day from which they can’t indemnify themselves. There was no magic cloak government could confer to shield them from the human and financial ravages the coronavirus pandemic wrought over the past two and a half years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Economic Development Partnership</span> <a href="https://www.nfib.com/content/nfib-in-my-state/virginia/state-says-25-virginia-businesses-are-closed-temporarily-or-permanently/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported in December 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that one-fourth of the commonwealth’s businesses had closed permanently or temporarily because of the pandemic. From early April through New Year’s Eve of that year, COVID-19 killed nearly 5,100 Virginians, according to</span><a href="https://data.virginia.gov/Government/VDH-COVID-19-PublicUseDataset-Cases_By-District-De/v5a8-4ahw/data" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we recall all too painfully the resulting tsunami of job losses and “financial one-way risk” to families that was aggravated by the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/08/scathing-audit-faults-poor-management-for-virginias-unemployment-insurance-failures/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Employment Commission’s inability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cope with record numbers of claims for unemployment benefits from 2020 well into this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no state safety net for the bend-but-don’t-break health care system that was stressed beyond its limits by the critically ill who flooded Virginia’s hospitals and created</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/20/a-henrico-facilitys-outbreak-was-one-of-the-deadliest-at-any-nursing-home-nationwide-experts-say-others-are-just-as-vulnerable/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">staggering death tolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for already frail</span><a href="https://www.aarp.org/ppi/issues/caregiving/info-2020/nursing-home-covid-dashboard.html?cmp=RDRCT-350d888f-20201013" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nursing home residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the early weeks of the pandemic, the government wasn’t even able to procure sufficient basic personal protective equipment such as face coverings and gloves for health care professionals. For many,</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/18/stretched-thin-nurses-bore-covid-19s-brunt-so-why-couldnt-the-governor-give-them-a-break/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">it was too much</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it drove them into other fields or into retirement. Some even found unemployment preferable to the daily horror and heartbreak of their jobs. The talent drain remains a significant problem for the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Virginia is expected to mitigate the pain for Dominion’s investors at ratepayers’ expense if its venture into the renewable energy space encounters choppy seas?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s statement also notes that the varied risks and problems that confront its new venture come “at a time when fuel costs have increased dramatically.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell us about it. We fill our tanks with gasoline and diesel, buy heating oil and pay your monthly bills. It wasn’t that long ago that a gallon of regular unleaded approached $5 in many parts of Virginia. It eased a bit over the summer, but</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/05/oil-opec-imposes-deep-production-cuts-in-a-bid-to-shore-up-prices.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">OPEC’s extortionate move</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week to cut production has reversed that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement continues by saying that with other prices rising, that leaves “renewable energy as one of the few ways to alleviate inflationary pressures on electricity prices.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s sensible and laudable. But it still doesn’t entitle Dominion to insist on an all-profit, no-risk approach to bringing green energy to the market devoid of measurable performance benchmarks.</span></p>

(CASA in Action)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">October 3, 2022</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond, Virginia</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Ron DeSantis of Florida,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have watched with keen interest your kind efforts to provide free transportation for new immigrants to visit some of our nation’s grand cities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I recall the time in my childhood when I first saw the gleaming towers of New York City – magical sights I had only glimpsed in movies and on our black-and-white TV of buildings that seemed to comb the clouds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same for Washington, D.C., and its venerable sites such as the Capitol, the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, the White House and the Pentagon – symbols of American freedom and might known worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ditto for Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago. The list goes on and on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To round up these new arrivals from abroad — the tired and the poor, the</span><a href="https://www.wonders-of-the-world.net/Statue-of-Liberty/Poem-by-Emma-Lazarus.php" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">huddled masses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yearning to breathe free, as it were — from their entry points in your states and whisk them off on one-way chartered bus and airplane junkets to these enchanting metropolises with literally just the clothes on their backs is so darn … </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">special</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But come on, guys. Spread the wealth!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, you’ve shared these new Americans-by-choice only with political jurisdictions governed by Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, New York City: The mayor is Democrat Eric Adams, and it’s in a state whose governor is Democrat Kathy Hochul. Chicago’s mayor is Democrat Lori Lightfoot, and another Democrat, J.B. Pritzker, is the governor of Illinois. The mayor of our nation’s capital, Muriel Bowser, is also a Democrat, as are the mayors of L.A. and San Francisco and the governor of California.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y’all sensing a pattern here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You both have an embarrassment of riches – particularly you, Gov. Abbott, with families crossing the Rio Grande in unprecedented numbers in their flight from the brutality, lawlessness and repression of failing communist regimes in places like Venezuela and Nicaragua. These folks, children and adults, have trod thousands of dangerous, blistering miles across South and Central America to reach the land of the free and the home of the brave so they can feed and shelter their families.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, Gov. Abbott, you have a point that migrants are crossing the border with Mexico, including your state, in increasingly high numbers, a fun fact borne out by the </span><a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/southwest-land-border-encounters" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Customs and Border Patrol’s own data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It shows that more than 200,000 a month have entered by the southern border since March.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I get it. Texas shouldn’t be expected to handle this solo. To a lesser extent, same goes for Florida and the refugees who reach its shores from Cuba, still an insular gulag and an economic basket case 63 years after Fidel Castro’s communist revolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then why limit your immigrant excursions to cities and states governed by the opposition party? That I don’t get.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider my beloved Virginia. Opportunity abounds here!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost every year, the financial news cable network CNBC ranks our commonwealth either the very best or among the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/13/americas-top-states-for-business-2022-the-full-rankings.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top states for business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And those businesses need workers! Bigly!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the spectrum, from private business to government offices, people left the workforce during the “great resignation” at the height of the pandemic with no plans to return, a phenomenon not reflected in unemployment statistics. Many businesses are so short of staff that they burn their employees out working them overtime just to keep their burgeoning backlogs manageable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are these people enduring such peril and privation to reach the United States? For freedom and security, yes, but specifically for jobs: An honest day’s wages for an honest day’s labor. What they need, Virginia has.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, there are states more needy, but</span><a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/states-employers-hiring/101730" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">WalletHub ranks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia ninth in its research on states where employers are struggling the most with hiring. The same study shows conditions are less dire for employers in Texas (ranked 26th) and the Sunshine State (46th).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Virginians are among the most giving folks in the country, according to</span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2019-12-10/the-most-charitable-states-in-america" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. News &amp; World Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its research ranks Virginia as the eighth most charitable state. Not to throw shade on your states, sirs, but the same survey ranks Florida 37th and Texas 40th. (OK, I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">was</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> throwing shade.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely you’re not holding out on us because our governor, Glenn Youngkin, is a Republican, as are our lieutenant governor, attorney general and lower legislative chamber. Hey, if that’s an issue, ol’ Glenn’s hardly even around here these days. He’s spending tons of time in other states (maybe even yours?) stumping for fellow Republicans in governors’ races. I suspect it will be that way until Election Day … also maybe in the early part of 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if it helps, we’ve got two Democratic U.S. senators in Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. A majority of our U.S. House delegation is blue too, but we do have a couple of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/24/stage-is-set-for-dramatic-house-races-in-virginia-this-fall/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">super</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> competitive congressional races</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in which Republicans have a decent shot at flipping seats now held by Democrats. I’m sure those GOP House candidates would welcome your new arrivals into their districts with a laurel and hearty handshake if you saw fit to send them. Shucks, Gov. Abbott, one of them, Yesli Vega, the Republican challenging Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger, is a Houston-born daughter of Salvadoran immigrants!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure there are other needful Republican-governed jurisdictions that would gladly welcome “the homeless, tempest-tost,” just as it says on the Statue of Liberty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why, I’d be shocked —</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shocked!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — if GOP governors like Kay Ivey in Alabama, Brian Kemp in Georgia, Tate Reeves in Mississippi, Jim Justice in West Virginia Asa Hutchinson in Arkansas and Kevin Stitt in Oklahoma haven’t already contacted y’all about taking some immigrants off your hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bear in mind that your GOP brothers and sisters will expect a neighborly heads-up well in advance as to how many are inbound and when and where they’re arriving so they can plan a proper reception and whatnot. I know neither of you did that for the surprise charters you’ve dispatched to date, and that’s something that’s not fair either to the host cities up north or to these weary travelers who have never seen snow, have no concept of the freezing temperatures they will experience in a few weeks and have never possessed a heavy coat. Using those people as political props made your largesse look like a petty partisan prank rather than responsible and compassionate governance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure that was just an oversight – a repeated, hateful oversight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I do believe you’d find life a lot easier if you shared the abundant human resources that have blessed your borders by reaching out to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of your gubernatorial colleagues with goodwill, with common courtesy and without regard to geography or partisan affiliation going forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saludos cordiales,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the sort of place where wild-eyed, un-American ideas get seeded by some radical who dares to think beyond this decade and where it would take root and, before you knew it, creep across the purple mountain majesties and the fruited plain like kudzu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure ’nuff, it happened: a sneak attack. OK … a sneak attack with 13 years’ notice, but that’s no time at all when you’re talking about ending the sale of new gasoline-powered cars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s my name. Glenn Youngkin. I command this conservative outpost called Virginia, and if those granola-munching, tree-hugging, Birkenstock-wearing lefties are spoiling to go toe-to-toe over our precious petroleum fluids, well … hold my Chardonnay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A slick-haired, tan-from-a-can dandy named Gavin Newsom, my counterpart in California, started this dust-up. And I aim to finish it. It was his doing and that of the lefty legislature out in the so-called Golden State that flat-out dictated that come 2035, there would be no more brand-new cars sold that rely on internal combustion of petroleum distillates for locomotion. If you buy it new off a dealer’s lot or order it online factory-fresh, it’ll run off hydrogen fuel like some spaceship or you’ll have to plug it in like some lowly vacuum cleaner or washing machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s pretty rich, ain’t it? A state that barely a week ago was warning of rolling blackouts on account of a freak heat wave draining its power grid is going to force folks to buy cars that run off the very electricity that they already can’t make enough of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that it’s any skin off ol’ Glenn’s hind parts if Californians won’t have the privilege of paying upwards of seven frogskins a gallon for regular gas – nearly nine bucks for high-test – as they did several weeks ago. What slaps my chaps is that what Newsom did means I’d have to do the same thing across the country here in god-fearin’, carbon-lovin’ Virginia, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hell</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I will.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m pulling Virginia out of this Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and I’m asking the General Assembly to repeal this perfidious state law <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/02/19/continuing-climate-change-fight-virginia-lawmakers-commit-to-clean-car-standards/" target="_blank">the Democrats passed in 2021</a> that requires us to follow California’s lead on emissions policy. </span><a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2022-05/%C2%A7177_states_05132022_NADA_sales_r2_ac.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seventeen other states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are part of this same devil’s deal, but I can only strike a blow for the good of our fossil fuels here in Virginia (unless I strike it lucky in the 2024 presidential primaries, but that’s another tale).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here comes Lionel Mandrake, my somewhat uptight, British-born environmental policy wonk, walking into my office. Right on time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mandrake, have a seat,” I said, motioning to the chair opposite my desk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good evening, sir. Do I understand correctly that we’re threatening to leave the multi-state vehicle emissions compact and that you’ve placed the House of Delegates on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Condition Red</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?” Mandrake said. “Good idea. Keep the lads on their toes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m afraid this isn’t a drill, Mandrake,” I replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh dear. Is California involved?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Looks like it. Could get pretty hairy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a sip of my preferred cocktail, an oaky Pinot Grigio and rainwater. “Mandrake, I can no longer sit back and allow leftist infiltration, leftist indoctrination, leftist subversion and the international leftist conspiracy to sap and impurify our precious petrochemical fluids!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But sir, might we be acting a bit … </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rashly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? I mean, the whole bloody point will likely be moot by 2035 whether we act or not. The mass conversion to electric vehicles is well under way. Detroit and the world’s other automakers are retooling and switching entire model lines pell-mell from internal combustion engines to electric motors. Why, there’s even a</span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2022/09/21/in-pulaski-driving-toward-the-future/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Electric%20truck%20start-up%20launches%20in%20Pulaski%20County&amp;utm_campaign=Wednesday%2C%20September%2021%2C%202022" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">new start-up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> right here in Virginia that’s in business converting big-rig tractors from diesel engines to electrical. Our own transportation department just announced plans for a</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/21/what-virginia-wants-to-do-with-100-million-in-electric-vehicle-charging-money/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">major expansion of electrical charging stations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> along interstates across Virginia. And our</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">friends at Dominion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are ever so keen on the idea of vehicles that use electricity,” Mandrake said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Friends? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?” I said, giving Mandrake the stink-eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Dreadfully sorry. Habit from the not-too-distant past,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mandrake, do you realize that EV dominance is the most monstrously conceived, leftist/environmentalist plot we’ve ever faced?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nevertheless, sir, carmakers are going where the money and incentives are, and if a market the size of Cali goes EV, so shall they. Were California  its own country, it would be the world’s</span><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/california-economy-16-mind-blowing-facts-2019-4-1028142608" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fifth-largest economy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> right behind Germany and just ahead of the United Kingdom — God save the king. California’s almost $3 trillion annual GDP accounts for nearly 15% of the entire American economy,” he continued in a pleading tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And sir,” Mandrake continued, “General Motors has</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/business/gm-zero-emission-vehicles.html#%3A~%3Atext%3DGeneral%20Motors%20said%20Thursday%20that%2Ctrucks%20and%20sport%20utility%20vehicles" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">already announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it will bring 30 new EV models to market in just the next three years and manufacture EVs exclusively by 2035. Ford has invested </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/13/gm-ford-are-all-in-on-evs-heres-how-dealers-feel-about-it-.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$22 billion into electric vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and 40% of all that it produces will be all-electric by 2030. Besides, sir, this shan’t affect the sale of pre-owned petrol-powered cars by one tuppence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sit down and chill, Mandrake. I’ve already gotten the ball rolling with Todd Gilbert and our boys in the House. There’s no stopping it now,” I said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I beg of you, Glenn – politics aside — have you considered the climatological implications? It brings us incrementally closer to … the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doomsday Machine</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” he said ominously. “It’s getting worse every year, sir: triple-digit temperatures in Portland, Oregon, and even Scotland, for goodness sake; a full-blown </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hurricane</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now forecast to blast the Canadian coast near Newfoundland; estuaries and reservoirs drying up in the American Southwest; hundred-year floods happening every year.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The libs have been using that global warming hooey to try to scare the bejeebers out of us for decades now. Every study the petroleum industry pays for proves the same thing: science can’t be trusted,” I replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But you don’t have to believe me, Mandrake,” I continued, buzzing my receptionist. “Can you send in Dr. Petrolove?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petro</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">love sir?” Mandrake asked. “Wasn’t he …”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah. I put him on retainer after he made parole for his part in that Enron nastiness back in the 2000s. Knows every dirty secret in the oil and gas biz and some they haven’t even thought up yet. If your ‘Doomsday Machine’ exists, Petro will know about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“’Sup, chief?” Petrolove called out in his Texas twang as he strutted into my office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Petro, Mandrake here tells me there’s the risk of some ‘Doomsday Machine’ that could plunge humanity into environmental oblivion if we keep standing up for our friends in the carbon-energy sector,” I said. “Go ahead and tell him how full of malarkey he is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um …,” Petro said, shuffling his cowboy boots, unable to look at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Go ahead, Doc. School Mandrake for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">el hefe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Petrolove said, haltingly clearing his throat, “the Doomsday Machine is real and terrifying, but completely credible and easy to understand. If we don’t decrease the carbon that we’re pumping into the atmosphere, it will create a doomsday shroud around the planet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chills ran down my back. I swallowed hard. Suddenly I understood. Why hadn’t I seen the devastating truth of this all along? Why had I clung to naïve beliefs in the face of clear evidence? It was, indeed, an inconvenient truth, but it was high time I accepted it … and spoke it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn shame the libs got to you, too, Petro. You’re fired.”</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politicians will play politics. And there’s nothing wrong with that, generally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem comes when the malignant notion takes hold that an overwhelmingly clean, fair process of administering elections is fair game for a partisan disinformation campaign to subvert public faith in the process and impose a corrupt system under one-party control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MAGA wing of today’s Republican Party knows that its ever-deepening right-wing nationalism, its penchant for bizarre and baseless conspiracies and the extremist candidates it attracts will alienate America’s mainstream and make it harder to win fair elections in an increasingly diverse nation without its heavy thumb on the scales.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest to give comfort toward that antidemocratic end is Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is creating a 20-person “election integrity unit” in his office. That’s particularly dismaying because Miyares is not among the Republicans who falsely claim President Joe Biden usurped Donald Trump’s presidency through fraud. At least that’s what the office’s spokeswoman, Victoria LaCivita, recently assured the Mercury’s Graham Moomaw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Miyares can’t resist playing politics and pandering to the GOP’s Trumpist hard-liners whom he could ask to nominate him for governor of Virginia in less than three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve covered elections and the machinery for carrying them out from the precinct level to the top echelons of state government for decades. Perhaps the most edifying part of that job is witnessing firsthand each year how ordinary Virginians, motivated by a strong civic spirit, invest exhausting hours at neighborhood voting precincts so citizens can vote. Up and down the line in Virginia, under Republican and Democratic administrations, election officials played it by the book without regard to party or ideology, helping Virginia’s electorate translate its collective will and wisdom into government policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system was never perfect. Mistakes occur. Antiquated technology fails. There’s both misfeasance and malfeasance, but deliberate wrongdoing on a scale that can alter an election’s legitimate outcome is exceedingly rare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One validation is the risk-limiting audits the Department of Elections conducts after each statewide election as required by Virginia law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2020 presidential and U.S. Senate races,</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/rla-results_nov-3-2020/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that the risk of a mistake large enough to reverse outcomes of the election – victories for Democrats Biden and Sen. Mark Warner – was less than a ten-thousandth of a percentage point. Expressed another way, the audit found accuracy levels for both races exceeded 99.9999%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the 2021 race, dominated by Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his GOP ticket, the risk-limiting audit tested two House of Delegates races – the</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/risk-limiting-audit/audit-report-13th-District-House-of-Delegates--2022-01-20T23_15-00_00.csv" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">13th House District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won by Democratic Del. Danica Roem over Republican Christopher Stone, both from Manassas, and the</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/media/formswarehouse/risk-limiting-audit/audit-report-House-of-Delegates-75th-District-2022-01-06T01_10-00_00.csv" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">75th District</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> won by Republican Otto Wachmann over longtime Democratic Del. Roslyn Tyler, both of Sussex – and again found accuracy levels exceeding 99.7%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malicious efforts to vote illegally or fraudulently influence an outcome are scarce if prosecutions or official litigation are a reliable measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conservative Heritage Foundation has created</span><a href="https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a searchable online database</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all the “recent proven instances of election fraud from across the country” that it can find. For context, it considers the early 1990s recent. It calls the database “a sampling” and “not an exhaustive or comprehensive list.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The database, spanning at least eight presidential elections, documents 1,375 proven instances of fraud. Of that total, 1,182 resulted in criminal convictions, 48 resulted in civil penalties, 103 resulted in a diversion program, and 42 resulted in official or judicial findings, which can sometimes overturn the result of an election or exclude a candidate from the ballot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty of the 1,375 cases were in Virginia. They date to 2007, and none involved findings that reversed elections. Six of the cases were false registrations, and five each were for ineligible voting, mostly by felons, and ballot petition fraud, mostly bogus signatures. The most serious case, tried in 2007, involved the former mayor of Appalachia and 14 others who were convicted of conspiring to buy votes in the 2004 municipal election with, among other things, cigarettes, beer and pork rinds. The mayor served two years in jail and two years of monitored home detention in what the Heritage Foundation calls “the largest voter fraud conspiracy to date in Virginia.”</span></p>

		<p class="newsroomBlockQuote ">The most serious case, tried in 2007, involved the former mayor of Appalachia and 14 others who were convicted of conspiring to buy votes in the 2004 municipal election with, among other things, cigarettes, beer and pork rinds.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the database includes only cases in which there has been a dispositive outcome, it does not reflect the recent indictment of Michele White, a former top Prince William County election official, on corruption charges as announced by Miyares’ office. As The Washington Post </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/09/07/prince-william-election-registrar-indicted/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported on Sept. 7</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, current Prince William County Registrar Eric Olsen said that a small number of votes in the 2020 election may have been affected, but not enough to affect any election results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voting or election fraud is serious business in a democracy. It deserves to be prosecuted. For every vote illegally cast or every action that falsifies or cheats someone out of the right to vote, a citizen is deprived of his or her franchise, the most precious of blessings in a democratic republic. The same goes for deceitful and intimidating voter-suppression tactics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to assert that it is somehow pervasive, as “election integrity” crusades rooted in Trump’s corrosive election lies do, is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider that in the 15-year span during which those 20 Virginia cases were adjudicated, nearly 41 million Virginians voted in fall general elections. That doesn’t count special elections, local municipal or county races or primaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s hardly a ratio that demands a call to arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares knows that. He’s a smart guy and a good lawyer. He knows that the office to which he was elected already has “full authority to do whatever is necessary or appropriate to enforce the election laws or prosecute violations thereof.” His prosecution of White had already demonstrated that better than his subsequent announcement of an election bunko squad ever could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s less to his strike force than meets the eye. It has no separate budget. It will be composed primarily of staff who can juggle election investigations alongside other duties to which they are already assigned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, alas, it’s good politics – for Miyares, anyway. Not only does it stoke a GOP base that will likely be asked to choose between him and Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in 2025 for the party’s gubernatorial nomination, but the unit stands to get a lot of fodder tossed its way soon because of an impending change in the partisan makeup of electoral boards in all 133 localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the spoils that go to the victor of gubernatorial elections is the right to have the new governor’s party dominate state and local electoral boards. Next year, those boards shift from Democratic majorities to GOP majorities. And in Miyares, they have an attorney general with a platoon poised to pounce on any perceived irregularities they feed him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How better to contrive an argument for restoring the restrictive voting laws the GOP implemented while it dominated the General Assembly for most of the first two decades of the 21st century? Laws like the photo ID requirement and rigid constraints on early and absentee voting that made it hard for marginalized and disabled Virginians to vote were repealed after Democrats briefly won full control of the General Assembly in 2019. Republicans, who regained a slim House majority last year, advanced voting restriction bills in the 2021 legislative session, but they died in a Democratic Senate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’d hope that Miyares and his party could advance beyond one election in which Virginia (and the nation) repudiated the most noxious president in U.S. history without trying to immolate the nation’s imperfect yet solid election infrastructure in obsequious fealty to Trump’s delusions. Virginia proved to the country last November, just one year after it had resoundingly elected Democrats, that its system is not rigged against Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And nothing made the case better than Miyares’ own impressive victory, the most unexpected of them all.</span></p>

(Kennedy Library)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, a court in Virginia Beach was asked to find two books depicting sexual activity obscene and ban their sale at a Barnes &amp; Noble store to people younger than age 18.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/30/judge-throws-out-obscenity-case-attempting-to-restrict-sales-of-books-in-virginia-beach/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">court declined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, largely sidestepping the question of whether the content was legally obscene and instead deconstructing the anachronistic state obscenity law dating to 1950 under which the complaint was brought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, this was litigation undertaken with an eye toward election year politics. It was filed by Del. Tim Anderson, a conservative lawyer, on behalf of fellow Republican Tommy Altman. At the time of the filing, Altman was running in the GOP 2nd Congressional District primary, attempting to run to the right of state Sen. Jennifer Kiggans, the eventual nominee.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The complaint sought to have the court declare “Gender Queer” and “A Court of Mist and Fury” obscene and ban their sale to minors unless they had the consent of their parents. Had the court ruled in Altman’s favor, any subsequent sale of either book or even the lending of them from one person to another anywhere in the commonwealth could have subjected the seller or lender to criminal penalties,</span> <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/virginia-obscenity-proceedings-against-two-books" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contends the ACLU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gender Queer” may ring a bell. Maia Kobabe’s graphic novel memoir was published in a format similar to a comic book with illustrations depicting sexual contact, masturbation, use of a sex toy and,</span> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/01/15/loudoun-schools-book-removed/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an erotic scene of a man and a boy on what appears to be a Grecian urn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The book became the most contested of 2021, based on an </span><a href="https://www.ala.org/advocacy/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/top10" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Library Association survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that tracked 729 challenges to library, school and university materials and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, it generated raucous debates at school board meetings, notably in Loudoun County but also in other localities, as outraged parents demanded the book’s removal from school libraries. Republican Glenn Youngkin’s successful gubernatorial campaign seized on the issue, and it gained traction, notably in Democratic-voting suburbs, as he championed the rights of students’ parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, Anderson and Altman were piggybacking on Youngkin’s success a year ago with the litigation, claiming that their lawsuit was intended to give parents oversight of what their minor children may purchase. Parental prerogatives make for potent and resonant politics, as former Gov. Terry McAuliffe</span> <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4979586/user-clip-terry-mcauliffe-i-parents-telling-schools-teach" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learned the hard way</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after a televised debate with Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But attempting to use a wobbly, antiquated law that trial Judge Pamela Baskervill noted would allow the government to exercise unconstitutional prior restraint against speech or expression is not the way to do it. The retired jurist, presiding for Virginia Beach judges who recused themselves because of the involvement of a lawmaker in a state where legislators appoint judges, also found the law unworkable because it could make criminals of people who sell or even lend books unaware that a judge in a locality hundreds of miles away had ruled the material obscene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In comments to journalists after Tuesday’s hearing, Anderson and Altman pondered the prospect of appealing the ruling to the Virginia Court of Appeals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In support of the intent, the men note the existence of age-based restrictions such as those that apply to movie theater admission and assert that similar systems should apply to books. Anderson said he is considering legislation for next winter’s General Assembly session that would establish such a system in state law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Movie ratings, however, are not imposed by law. They are voluntary, a regimen put in place in 1968 by the Motion Picture Association of America that assesses the appropriateness of films for children and teens and designates them accordingly on a scale from G, for all audiences, to NC-17, forbidden to all under 17. Nobody risks arrest, a day in court or jail time if a 16-year-old watches an NC-17 flick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even arguing in 2022 over archaic constructs from the final third of the previous century is a fool’s errand – a doomed finger-in-the-dike approach to holding back oceans of digital content that children are far more adept at accessing than their parents. And much of what dwells online is more harmful than any book ever placed on the shelves of a library or bookstore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also mystifying why efforts to restrain expression focus so obsessively on sexuality, especially LGBTQ issues, with far less regard for mind-warping, gratuitous violence including interactive, immersive bloodlust fantasies and how-to kits for building bombs and firearms. A creative kid with a credit card number can access a gambling portal and squander untold sums in seconds. All of those arguably carry more potential for ruin than words or illustrations that explore one’s sexual awakening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, there are safeguards intended to deter children from abusing online venues they have no business visiting, and some of them have real teeth, but any kid worth his username can easily defeat them if left to his or her own devices absent parental supervision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ah! There’s that word again that Anderson, Altman, Youngkin and other Republicans have leveraged politically with varying degrees of success: “parental.” And credit them: they’ve rightly underscored for the political world how essential and difficult parenting is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of my sons are grown and have long since ventured out on their own. The eldest has a child, and I worry about the world in which he and my daughter-in-law must raise him. The job that they have is much tougher than it was when my sons were children, with many of today’s threats unfathomable then. But sexual content – some of it explicit, even obscene – isn’t among those threats; it was around even before my long-ago childhood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfair as it may seem, those heightened risks and the hard work of neutralizing or minimizing them resides first with parents. But it’s also incumbent on society and our communities to better aid and empower them. The most effective solutions are the least expensive and intrusive, and they needn’t involve government – three virtues that should gladden any conservative’s heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities owe it to young families to police themselves for situations that compromise the safety of children and call out habitually bad actors. Neighborhoods – and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">neighbors</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – owe it to them by being connected, mindful and watchful for one another and all the children in their midst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those concepts work, or at least they did in a simpler, less riven America. The term “it takes a village” was around for ages before Hillary Clinton appropriated it as the title for her 1996 book. The “village” approach accomplished far more than the heavy hand of government ever can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t know if villages of that sort are possible in the collection of quarrelsome tribes that our culture has devolved into over the past decade or so. That’s a shame because it leaves only inflexible legislation, exorbitant appropriations and still more divisive litigation as a sorry substitute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as poor an option as legislation and litigation are, those are easier for guys like Anderson to tout on 2023 re-election campaign materials than a genuine – even quixotic – appeal to the common good and the better angels of our nature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, if you want a pretty good idea how things are going to go, just follow a pair of Virginia races in the state’s 2nd and 7th Congressional Districts. Those two bellwethers are likely to presage a trend for one party or the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If Virginia 7 flips, I think that’s indicative of a pretty good night for Republicans,” said Kyle Kondik, a researcher at the University of Virginia Center for Politics and managing editor of its nationally followed newsletter, “</span><a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2022-house/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Likewise, if Virginia 2 stays Democratic, that’s the kind of world in which Democrats could still be holding the House,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both races feature incumbent Democratic women elected in the 2018 blue wave midterms who are being challenged for a third term by Republican women in brand-new districts whose electoral history and demogr</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aphics make them prime political barometers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The respected</span><a href="https://www.270towin.com/2022-house-election/cook-political-2022-house-ratings" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Cook Political Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rates the 7th District race between Rep. Abigail Spanberger and Republican nominee Yesli Vega and the 2nd District contest pitting Rep. Elaine Luria against Jennifer Kiggans, a Republican state senator from Virginia Beach, as toss-up races — two of 33 nationwide that, by Cook’s reckoning, could break either way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “Crystal Ball” and the nonpartisan</span><a href="https://insideelections.com/ratings/house" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside Elections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also rated Luria’s district as a toss-up as of last week, but both gave a very tenuous edge to Spanberger in the 7th District. Sabato’s newsletter listed 21 House races nationally as a coin-toss, and Inside Politics listed 19.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The political </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cognoscenti</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forecast a Republican takeover of the House, where Democrats as of last week held 221 seats and Republicans held 212. The GOP needs to flip just five Democratic seats to take the majority. Out-of-power parties have a built-in advantage in midterm elections. And this year, the major steering currents – an uncertain economy with the highest inflation in 40 years and an unpopular president – are headwinds for Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats are given better odds for retaining control of the Senate. But Virginia is sitting out this fall’s Senate races. Sen. Mark Warner won a new six-year term in 2020; Sen. Tim Kaine is up for re-election in 2024. So that puts all the focus on the U.S. House races.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides the 2nd and 7th districts, the only other race generating buzz is Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton’s bid to keep her 10th District seat in Northern Virginia. Reapportionment added GOP-leaning precincts in Rappahannock and Fauquier counties to her district, making it less favorable than the 10th District she won twice before. But it is still a district that has given Democrats comfortable margins in recent elections, though former Gov. Terry McAuliffe edged out Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin by just 1.6 percentage points there last fall. Cook and Inside Elections rate Wexton’s seat as safe from little-known GOP challenger Hung Cao. Sabato is slightly less generous, downgrading Wexton’s seat this summer from “safe” to “likely Democratic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the stakes so high, expect unprecedented spending on Virginia’s marquee House races underwritten by national partisan organizations such as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee. There will be even more by secretive special interest groups whose donors are opaque and whose claims are often wildly exaggerated, sometimes false.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the final week of the summer doldrums, before campaigns throttle up for the fall’s stretch run, the advertising spend was nearly $7 million in the</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/us-representative-2/elections/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2nd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ($2.8 million supporting Luria or attacking Kiggans; just shy of $4 million on Kiggans’ behalf or attacking Luria) and nearly $9 million in the</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/political-ads/election-10474/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">7th</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with its pricier D.C.-area media market ($4.7 million for Spanberger or slamming Vega; $4 million supporting Vega or attacking Spanberger). And those figures, based on Federal Communications Commission filings tabulated by the</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/about-us/mission/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Public Access Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, don’t include independent expenditures by outside organizations allied with various candidates or parties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s new U.S. House district lines bear little resemblance to those of 2020. They were drafted by the state Supreme Court, a task foisted onto the justices after the new independent redistricting commission</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/10/08/va-redistricting-commission-implodes-as-republicans-reject-compromise-and-democrats-walk-out/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">failed to do the job</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Analysts who’ve crunched precinct-by-precinct election data say the plan is balanced overall. Rural districts in the Southside, Southwest and Shenandoah Valley will remain predictably Republican. Urbanized and suburban districts near the Beltway will reliably back Democrats. The battlegrounds are in districts that meld rural areas with urban or suburban ones.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_3558" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:200px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Elaine-Luria-Headshot.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-3558" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Elaine-Luria-Headshot-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Elaine-Luria-Headshot-200x300.jpg 200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Elaine-Luria-Headshot-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Elaine-Luria-Headshot-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Elaine-Luria-Headshot-696x1044.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Elaine-Luria-Headshot-1068x1602.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Elaine-Luria-Headshot-280x420.jpg 280w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Elaine-Luria-Headshot-1920x2880.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Elaine-Luria-Headshot.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  <em>U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Norfolk.</em></p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fiercest is likely to be Luria’s fight for survival in a district that covers Virginia’s entire Atlantic Coast, from the Eastern Shore’s border with Maryland to the North Carolina line before it juts westward. Redistricting cost Luria Democratic-friendly precincts in Norfolk and on the Peninsula. Her district, now slightly redder, is also known for shifting partisan allegiances. Should Kiggans win, it will be the fifth time since 2000 that one party has taken the seat from the other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“An interesting thing about Virginia 2 is that it just so happens to be the median district for presidential performance of all 435 districts in the country,” Kondik said. That means if you took all the new districts and arrayed them along a spectrum from the strongest support for Trump in 2020 to the strongest for Biden, “the one smack-dab in the middle at 218 is Virginia 2, and Biden won it by 2 (percentage) points,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year later, Youngkin would carry those same precincts by 11 percentage points over McAuliffe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luria and Kiggans are both Navy veterans in a district closely tied to the</span><a href="https://cnrma.cnic.navy.mil/Installations/NAVSTA-Norfolk/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">world’s largest naval base</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and highly attuned to foreign affairs and national security. Luria is betting heavily on her role on the House committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol siege by a mob loyal to former President Donald Trump. The only endangered Democrat on the panel, Luria had a starring role in the nationally televised</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrT_qfcCtvU" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">July 21 primetime hearing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, during which her questioning led witnesses to detail the former president’s callous inaction as rioters intent on hanging then-Vice President Mike Pence came within feet of him inside the Capitol before his besieged security detail evacuated him from it.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_20488" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:209px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kiggans.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-20488" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kiggans-209x300.png" alt="" width="209" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kiggans-209x300.png 209w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kiggans-293x420.png 293w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/kiggans.png 398w" sizes="(max-width: 209px) 100vw, 209px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  <em>State Sen. Jennifer Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach.</em></p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much her moment in the spotlight will help or hurt Luria is unknowable. It will steel the resolve of Trump admirers to vote against her just as it will motivate those who detest the former president to vote for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But bigger issues are at play in the highly nationalized 2nd and 7th District races. While the economy favors the GOP, that edge could soften if energy prices continue easing and inflation cools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other issues emerged over the summer from which Spanberger and Luria could benefit. The most potent is the conservative U.S. Supreme Court’s reversal in June of the 1973 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roe v. Wade</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision that upheld women’s right to reproductive autonomy for 49 years, unleashing furious protest and handing Democrats a formidable organizational, fundraising and mobilization tool. Republicans were alarmed when voters in conservative Kansas resoundingly</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/upshot/kansas-abortion-vote-analysis.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">defeated a referendum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a proposed statewide abortion ban. Abortion also figured significantly in Democrat</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/24/nyregion/pat-ryan-special-election-abortion.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Pat Ryan’s victory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week in a special election to fill a vacant New York House seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden remains a burden on Democrats, but his fortunes improved over the summer. He</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/19/1118419271/-4-trillion-how-the-biden-administrations-legislative-successes-became-reality" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">won passage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for several key pieces of his policy agenda in a narrowly divided Congress. In the middle of it all, he authorized a</span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/hellfire-missiles-al-qaeda-leader-al-zawahiri-minimal/story?id=87885003" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">precision missile strike</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that killed the world’s most-wanted terrorist and architect of the 9/11 attacks, al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawhari, as he sipped his morning coffee on the balcony of his Kabul townhouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though his poll numbers have been underwater for a full year, Biden’s job approval mark in the</span><a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president-biden-job-approval-7320.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Real Clear Politics Average of Polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> surged last week to 42%, its highest mark since early May and a 5 percentage point jump from his all-time low of 36.8% a month earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Could Democrats actually hold the House? I don’t think the door’s entirely slammed shut. Maybe it’s cracked open more than it was,” Kondik said. “But if the Democrats are going to hold onto it, Virginia 2 is the kind of seat they need to hang onto.”</span></p>
<p><em>This story has been corrected to note that <span style="font-weight: 400;">reapportionment added GOP-leaning precincts in Rappahannock, not Loudoun, County to the 10th District.</span></em></p>

(Photo by Ryan M. Kelly/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tomorrow, the first rituals of fall and a fresh school year will renew themselves as boys (and some girls) across Virginia snap the chin straps to their helmets, dig their cleats into the turf and start a new season of high school football.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, the nostalgia gets so thick I could spread it with a butter knife. Football was all I wanted to do when I was the age of these kids who will take the field for the opening games of 2022 on Friday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was fortunate enough to do it longer than many and play the game at a respectable level – Ole Miss of the Southeastern Conference. I got a college degree out of it. Much as I once dreamed of playing the game on Sundays, my skill set was not NFL caliber, and I realized that in time to get serious about academics and a future as a journalist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So pardon me while I bite the hand that fed me: football must change itself radically to survive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you follow the sport at all – or, perhaps more notably, if you follow neuroscience – you are familiar with “chronic traumatic encephalopathy,” an insidious, irreversible degenerative condition linked to brain trauma from the same type of blows to the head that are inherent to American football and boxing, to name two conspicuous causes from sports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stories</span><a href="https://www.al.com/alabamafootball/2022/08/former-alabama-coach-ray-perkins-had-degenerative-brain-disease-cte-in-my-heart-i-knew-he-had-it.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">like this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the late Ray Perkins – one of Johnny Unitas’s favorite receivers as a Baltimore Colt and later head coach of the NFL’s New York Giants, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and his alma mater, the Alabama Crimson Tide – tend to make the story real for football fans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when you learn that a former teammate and old friend is in the same twilight struggle that contributed to Perkins’ demise and those of many other former football players of a variety of ages, it becomes personal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I knew then – the 1970s – what I know today about CTE, which essentially hollows out vast expanses of its victims brains over time, I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">might</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not have risked playing the game I loved and still follow devotedly in spite of myself. If I could, the 66-year-old me writing these words would zoom back in time half a century and tell the 16-year-old me, about to start my final high school season, that the game’s not worth the risk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My answer is equivocal because I doubt my younger self would have listened to the creaky, cautious, old gray man offering him hard-learned decades of insights. Such admonitions hold little currency among testosterone-fueled boys that age who believe they can run unscathed through a brick wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That feeling of being 10 feet tall and bulletproof is why we played the game as recklessly as we did – with players far larger, faster, stronger and more violent than than our fathers, in more primitive, less protective gear, had been. That sense of invincibility was abetted by advances in headgear and equipment design, particularly unbreakable fiberglass helmets with shatterproof, steel-reinforced face masks that allowed players to use their faces as battering rams, heedless of the devastating consequences that the shock from such crashes causes inside the cranium.  Such blows would have been unfathomable a generation earlier to players who wore leather helmets </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sans</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> facemasks and </span><a href="https://youtu.be/A1bI9Z8Kp1I" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were taught</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to block and tackle with their shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My freshman season in college, we were explicitly instructed to aim the middle of our face masks like guided missiles between the numbers on the ball carrier’s jersey (the one part of his body he can’t juke) and explode through the target with the force of our whole bodies. There was a phrase for it: “Bow your neck and stick your nose in there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The results, even in practice, were predictable. Some guys were cold-cocked. Others saw stars and were disoriented. We laughed it off when a defensive player who “had his bell rung” stumbled into the offensive team’s huddle in practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My worst bell-rung moment came in a 1977 game against Alabama in Birmingham. I was a center, the guy who had to snap the ball to a punter about 13 yards behind me in eight-tenths of a second or less, then run downfield and try to tackle the world-class sprinter who catches the punt. On this hot early September night, Ole Miss’s punter, Jim Miller, boomed a high, hanging kick late in the game, and I had zeroed my facemask in on Tide All-American and eventual All-Pro Tony Nathan, convinced that he either had to duck out of bounds or run … straight into me and my oncoming face mask. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I didn’t know was that another Bama All-American and future All-Pro, Barry Krauss, was sprinting downfield to block for Nathan and had me in his crosshairs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time I awoke flat on my back on the Legion Field Astroturf, Nathan had run the ball about 60 yards in the other direction. The stadium lights spun like a merry-go-round. The roar of the huge Alabama crowd sounded tinny and far-away, as though heard over a car radio. I couldn’t get air back in my lungs. The rest of our blowout loss was a blur.</span></p>

		<p class="newsroomBlockQuote ">Would I be more mentally agile now had it not been for all those hits? I’ll never know. CTE can only be definitively diagnosed by an autopsy.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In film review the next afternoon where the coaches dissected our drubbing, I saw the hit from a pressbox view and thought I resembled a dog that had blundered onto a freeway in front of an 18-wheeler. From the point of contact to the spot where I came to rest, I traveled about 12 feet, most of it in the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Damn, Lewis,” said an assistant coach, who reran the film forward and backward repeatedly, “I never saw anybody fly that far without a boarding pass.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think about that and lesser blows I absorbed and inflicted during my dozen youthful seasons playing varied levels of organized tackle football. It bothers me when I can’t recall a name right on the tip of my tongue, when I walk into a room and momentarily forget why I came in there, or when I’m writing and a word or fact doesn’t fall into place as quickly as it once did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it a normal part of aging? Would I be more mentally agile now had it not been for all those hits? I’ll never know. CTE can only be definitively diagnosed by an autopsy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I do know is this: I posted the link to the aforementioned Perkins article on social media recently and one of the comments came from a beloved fellow member of my 1973 freshman football class at Mississippi. It was a devastatingly honest and plaintive revelation that he is dealing with some of the symptoms that bedeviled Perkins: depression, anxiety, fractured relationships, to name a few. To numb the brain, he wrote, he used alcohol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It broke my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been rules changes at all levels of the sport to outlaw using the helmet as a weapon, to penalize blows to the head and eject players from the game who commit them, and to mandate that players medically diagnosed with concussions be withheld from contact until the brain injury has healed, even if it takes weeks. Football has made grudging, incremental gains, but brain trauma is still far too common in the sport. The Virginia High School League</span><a href="https://www.vhsl.org/sports-medicine/concussions/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has its own guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for concussion protocols.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My heart would mourn the loss of the matchless autumnal magic that to me has always been football, especially at the high school and collegiate levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But my advice to kids across Virginia on the eve of tomorrow’s season-opening kickoffs: until the game drastically reduces or eliminates the devastating blows to the head that are commonplace among ever larger, faster and stronger athletes, it’s not worth the risk.</span><i> </i></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selma. Kent State. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both are known to history, at least on first blush, as loaded euphemisms for notoriously violent upheavals, characterizations that blemish the goodness of those places and their people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just over five years ago, another city joined the list of those that need no state name, datelines that stand alone in implied infamy. Charlottesville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was nothing the modern city of Charlottesville wanted, and it’s absolutely nothing it deserved. The images, sounds and descriptions that saturated every form of media as it happened showed almost medieval-style fighting incongruously set against the backdrop of the quaint, open-air mall that gives the city its cozy, cultured, college-town character.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White people, mostly men, brought flags of Nazi Germany, the Confederacy and neo-fascist banners to Charlottesville and the University of Virginia, where they bellowed their hatred and ignorance to a global audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the sun set on the sickening events of Aug. 12, 2017, 32-year-old Heather Heyer</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/13/543175919/violence-in-charlottesville-claims-3-victims" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">lay dead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and dozens were maimed after a neo-Nazi sped his car through a downtown street and into a crowd of counterprotesters after the day’s worst fighting abated. The assailant, avowed Hitler acolyte James Alex Fields Jr.,</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/28/james-fields-jr-charlottesville-sentencing-heather-heyer-unite-the-right/1587233001/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was sentenced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the equivalent of centuries in prison for a litany of federal and state felonies including hate crimes and murder. Adding to the heartbreaking carnage, two Virginia State Police troopers who had monitored the riot from a helicopter, Berke M.M. Bates of Quinton and Jay Cullen of Midlothian, died when the</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/helicopter-pilot-in-fatal-charlottesville-crash-lost-control-and-lacked-key-training-from-state-ntsb-says/2020/07/15/528fe8ec-c6ef-11ea-8ffe-372be8d82298_story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">aircraft crashed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> near Charlottesville in the late afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A night earlier, hundreds of white nationalists carrying decorative lawn torches designed to burn citronella oil and chanting “Jews will not replace us” as well as the Third Reich mantra “blood and soil” marched through the grounds of the University of Virginia and around its centerpiece structure, the Rotunda, before instigating a brawl with counterprotesters who had gathered around a statue of the university’s founder, Thomas Jefferson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because Charlottesville, a progressive island in a sea of conservative rural Virginia, was planning to remove from a city park a statue of Robert E. Lee, commander of an army that waged war against the United States in support of a government premised on human enslavement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To an unholy coalition of protofascist extremists that included, but was not limited to, neo-Nazis, Klan members, Confederate sympathizers and neo-Confederates, that was intolerable. They descended on Charlottesville armed and angry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In televised comments the afternoon of the riot, President Donald Trump drew a moral equivalence between the belligerent combatants who turned out for the Unite the Right rally and counterprotesters. He denounced an “egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took Trump two more days to call out the neo-Nazis. A day after he did that, he gave those groups more rhetorical cover during a White House news conference when he praised Lee as “a great general,” sympathized with efforts to block removal of his statue and, most memorably, said there were “very fine people, on both sides.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden, who would defeat Trump’s re-election bid three years later, cited Trump’s response as his reason for entering the presidential race. Biden’s victory would unleash many of those same far-right forces, all loyal to Trump, in another violent siege, this one on the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to block Congress from confirming Biden as the rightful president-elect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this took a deep toll of anguish and internal acrimony on Charlottesville, which struggled to regain a sense of community in the riot’s fractious aftermath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Gibson spent a distinguished career as a top state government and politics correspondent based in Charlottesville at its newspaper, the Daily Progress. Nobody understands the city’s pulse and history better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Charlottesville was a victim, no question, and the city’s name is still, unfortunately, tarred too much by those who brought their violence to our town,” Gibson said last week. He had put</span> <a href="https://roanoke.com/opinion/commentary/gibson-where-does-charlottesville-go-to-get-back-its-good-name/article_e473d96c-4c6b-5441-87d2-cd800a848c24.html?fbclid=IwAR3sjxZ2gLan-mECqUiFXLM_a6zqfLGraI30px6X4wyvGDuQ91izuWqoW3g" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his own thoughts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the issue into print in a monthly column he still does for his old newspaper and the Roanoke Times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fair or not (and it’s not), the city’s name may bear that stain for a long time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Selma, a quiet town in southeastern Alabama, labored for decades under the ugly image of state troopers bludgeoning Black people crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge on “Bloody Sunday,” the start of a march in 1965 to the state capitol in Montgomery in support of voting rights. A leader of that march, future Congressman John Lewis, would</span><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/rep-john-lewis-recalls-bloody-004857694.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">often recall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that after a nightstick cracked his skull that day, “I thought I saw death.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first returns of a Google search of “Kent State University” are accounts of the May 1970 antiwar protest in which four students were killed and nine were injured when Ohio National Guard troops opened fire on unarmed students. Neil Young helped cement the notorious moment into an entire generation’s memory with his antiwar anthem “Ohio” and its unsettling refrain: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Got to get down to it, soldiers are cutting us down. Should have been done long ago. What if you knew her and found her dead on the ground? How can you run when you know?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past five years, Charlottesville residents have bitterly debated the torpid response by local and state governments to events that, after the previous night’s brownshirt-style torchlight march and confrontation at the university, were wholly predictable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gibson was among about 600 people who at the time the march began was attending a speech by Yale University lecturer and leftward political activist Cornel West at St. Paul’s Memorial Church across University Avenue from the Rotunda. He grasped the meaning of the gathering and the impending crisis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We got out of that church service about the time those folks, 200 to 300 strong, were marching around the Rotunda with tiki torches and yelling ‘Jews will not replace us.’ It was an ugly, ugly, ugly scene and we were told that they had weapons. They used their tiki torches to throw at the students who were at the Jefferson statue in front of the Rotunda that night,” Gibson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials had ordered the “Unite the Right” rally out of downtown and into a park outside the city center. Its organizers challenged the city’s decision in court and had it reversed, returning the event to a more congested, urban and combustible setting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Police had assembled in sufficient strength but were inexplicably held back as battle lines formed and the fighting commenced. By the time officers were fully deployed, the situation raged out of control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likewise, Virginia National Guard troops waiting outside of downtown were not summoned as protesters set upon counterprotesters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath, city government was convulsed by the wrath of its residents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Five years ago, everybody was blaming the political leadership as well as the police,” said Gibson, who directed UVA’s</span><a href="https://sorenseninstitute.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorensen Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Political Leadership for eight years after his journalism career. “Charlottesville was a very divided place. City Council meetings were so disruptive that you couldn’t go there and expect to be heard with the yelling and screaming and demanding more change than you could do in a day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five years and a pandemic later, things have calmed, but the tragedy of Aug. 12 will never disappear. It shouldn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The street corner where Heyer was murdered is the scene of constant impromptu memorials. The totems erected after Reconstruction that glorified secessionist “lost cause” narratives have been removed subject to the due process of law. The familiar rhythms of the tranquil city at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains are returning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those who call Charlottesville home know that. Most Virginians do too. But mention the city’s name to folks in, say, Long Beach, California, or Chicago, or Fort Worth, Texas, and it’s the gothic brutality of that day that springs to mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, as Gibson rhetorically asks in his most recent column, “Where does Charlottesville go to get back its good name?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good question. Unfortunately, there’s no good answer.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury 2019) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has justifiably prided itself on its kindergarten through 12th grade public schools that have been well regarded nationally – certainly as a cut above those of most of her sister Southern states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, our student outcomes and college admission statistics have been, over the decades, comparable to those of the perennial elites in the Northeast and upper Midwest. The commonwealth’s educated workforce has been reflected in Virginia’s frequent rankings as the best state – or among the two or three top states – for business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of that is now at imminent risk as the backbone of our public school infrastructure — teachers and other educational professionals — race for the exits in unprecedented droves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, Virginia, this is not a drill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are not alone. The depletion of the professional public school educator corps has reached crisis levels across the country, with an alarm being sounded not only by advocates for teachers but also by school administrators’ organizations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the eve of the 2022-23 academic year, panicked Virginia school superintendents are scrambling to staff critical vacancies. In Virginia Beach, officials are trying to entice retired teachers to return to the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kate Masters’ must-read</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/09/virginias-teacher-shortage-is-fueling-big-spending-on-recruitment-and-retention/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reporting</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in The Mercury last week showed that in the state capital region alone, the shortage could be as high as 1,000, according to an estimate by Richmond School Board member Elizabeth Doerr. Masters documented 163 unfilled teaching slots in the city’s schools, and 211 and 243 in the neighboring Henrico and Chesterfield divisions, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The causes of the Great Educator Exodus didn’t pop up overnight, or even over the past year. They’ve lingered and worsened for many years and were sharpened and aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teacher salaries are at the heart of it and have been for decades. Since the 1990s, Virginia has ranked in the mid- to high 20s nationally for average teacher pay. And pay raises given sparingly over the years failed to keep pace with inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average annual Virginia teacher’s salary 20 years ago was $41,743, then the 23rd highest in the land. Had pay just kept pace with the Consumer Price Index over that time, the average today would be $68,726. Instead, it’s just under $60,000, good for 25th place, according to the most recent state</span> <a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/teaching/workforce_data/salaries/2020-2021-teacher-salary-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span> <a href="https://www.nea.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/2022%20Rankings%20and%20Estimates%20Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Education Association</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, the system has held thus far. Virginia ranks 10th for pre-K through high school performance in the latest</span> <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/rankings/education" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. News &amp; World Report’s Education Rankings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortages that have caused the system to buckle are approaching the point where officials fear it could snap. “I have never seen it this bad,” the head of the School Superintendents Association, Dan Domenech,</span> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/08/03/school-teacher-shortage/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">told the Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay, however, is not the lone factor pushing educators like John Reaves to rethink their career choices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s burnout – the result of overwork as fewer teachers preside over more crowded classrooms representing levels of student achievement ranging from advanced to remedial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the end … I was teaching classes with a high concentration of students with diverse needs,” said Reaves, a 2007 graduate of Henrico’s Mills E. Godwin High School who returned to his alma mater to teach English for five years. “When you have 25 kids who are anywhere from AP (advanced placement) to those who probably should have a 101 environment, it just makes a single teacher trying to accommodate all of that seem like an impossible task.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s the lasting learning loss that students suffered from the pandemic’s disruptions and months of remote learning that devalued the teacher’s role and profoundly corroded the classroom teaching dynamic. Reaves said that remote learning conditioned students to regard teachers as “just another voice on their laptop or phone” rather than authority figures, a dysfunction that persisted when in-person learning was restored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s much less respect and appreciation for the professionalism of teachers from the public, from parents and, increasingly, from elected officials. Across the nation, culture warriors have assailed school boards, administrators, teachers and librarians over issues such as equity for LGBTQ students and the truthful teaching of America’s complicated and troubled history, particularly regarding race.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, Republican Glenn Youngkin made the alleged teaching of “critical race theory,” a graduate-level concept found on college syllabi that every school district in Virginia denied was in its curriculum, a significant and resonant issue in his successful campaign. Now governor, Youngkin’s administration has set up an anonymous email snitch line parents can use to accuse faculty of instruction or practices they consider “inherently divisive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of it all – the constraints on creativity, expanded demands and diminished esteem for his livelihood and the gratification he derived from it – Reaves had enough, likening what his job had become to “babysitting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In order for the students to receive what I think they need from a teacher, it took all of my life, and I just can’t do that anymore,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Reaves left Godwin in June to pursue a new career as a screenwriter, a passion he and his wife, Sara Roan, have indulged in producing independent films. “</span><a href="https://vimeo.com/686329072" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and Him and Me</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” a drama the couple shot “on a shoestring” in Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, won a competition at the Gila Valley Film Festival in New Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping bright, engaged and imaginative educators like Reaves in the profession is a challenge America has barely begun to grasp. Expect the problem to worsen before solutions are found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the General Assembly took a laudable first step by including teachers in a 10% state employee pay raise in the new 2023-24 budget. That should elevate the commonwealth closer to the national average, but once you factor in an annualized inflation rate of 8 to 9%, the higher take-home pay is already spoken for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School divisions desperately trying to address the short-term problem on a money-first, hand-to-mouth basis will only worsen the problem over the long term. Already, school divisions are offering incentives such as stipends to poach teachers from other districts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Masters’ reporting noted, Richmond is offering $2,000 signing bonuses and $6,000 in moving expenses to lure teachers from localities more than 50 miles from the city, effectively setting off a bidding war for teachers willing to pull up stakes.</span> <a href="https://www.cbs17.com/news/local-news/wake-county-news/wake-county-billboard-offers-up-to-10k-for-teachers-to-work-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A billboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> along Interstate 440 in Wake County, North Carolina, promises a $10,000 bonus to teachers who move to Richmond. But what about Virginia teachers who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">haven’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> left? Will they share in the bounty fronted to incoming free agents? Imagine the resentment and the departures that will be precipitated if they don’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not one of the many educators I have known got into the business thinking they would crack the Forbes Richest list. They did it because teaching was (or is) their passion. Watching current and former students flourish is a lasting source of fulfillment to them. The abiding gratitude and affection of those students, the respect for their work within their communities and the knowledge that they strengthened the foundation of a working, self-governing civil society and the economy that underpins it for generations to come are the non-monetary rewards they treasure well into retirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s past time for Virginia and the rest of the nation to financially prioritize public education, but the educator departures that now imperil America’s long-term intellectual infrastructure in the global knowledge economy require a holistic overhaul far beyond mere compensation increases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elected leaders from courthouses to statehouses to the White House have to seek out the John Reaveses who are taking their innovations and talents out of our classrooms and away from our children, listen to what they’re saying and fix this before it’s too late.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t live near Richmond and get your news from its regional media market, the last time you probably heard of a place called Dogwood Dell was a little over a month ago when Virginia’s capital city made national news for boldly claiming to have foiled a mass shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The claim by Richmond’s police chief and mayor came on the heels of atrocities in Uvalde and Buffalo. Just two days earlier, a rooftop gunman indiscriminately mowed down spectators lining a Fourth of July parade route on the streets of Highland Park, Illinois.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Chief Gerald Smith and Mayor Levar Stoney explained to a phalanx of television cameras on July 6, a tip from a “hero citizen” allowed police to apprehend two Guatemalan men illegally in the United States and foil their plot to take high-powered firearms to Dogwood Dell, a bandshell and amphitheater in a city park, and unleash hell on hundreds attending an evening Independence Day concert and fireworks display.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story made network evening newscasts, an upbeat counterpoint to the fresh horror from suburban Chicago. Smith did cable news interviews</span> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/06/us/richmond-virginia-tip-mass-shooting-thwarted/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with outlets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN, spreading the word. The publicity was a perfect balm for a police department whose community relations had been strained mightily by its heavy-handed response in the summer of 2020 to demonstrations along Richmond’s Monument Avenue triggered by the broad-daylight police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stoney was forced to fire the police chief at the time, William Smith (no relation to the current chief), after officers in riot gear teargassed, maced, cursed and kicked protesters gathered peacefully at the since-razed statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. It took the city two years, prodded by the settlement of a citizens’ lawsuit, to formally apologize for those police actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this summer, in the first week of July, buoyed by national headlines of a police triumph and lives spared, the city seemed to have made notable strides toward restoring faith in its leadership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story seemed almost too good to be true. Now, a month later, a city prosecutor has given us reason to believe it’s not true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked directly in open court by Richmond General District Court Judge David Hicks last week if there was any evidence of plans to attack Dogwood Dell on July Fourth, Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Clint Seal gave a clear, unequivocal and crushing response: “No.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that moment wasn’t the first time cracks in the city’s story had appeared. Troubling questions began surfacing as early as the upbeat July 6 press conference itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why, if there was a known threat of a mass shooting, were the Dogwood Dell festivities allowed to proceed as scheduled, particularly with one of the two suspects not yet in custody?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why was one of the suspects – at a minimum, a person illegally in the country – granted a low $15,000 bond on the same day Smith and Stoney announced his arrest? Five days later, another judge thought better of it and revoked the man’s bond, meaning both suspects are now being held without bail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why, if the alleged plot was so ignominious and worthy of the bold assertions unambiguously trumpeted by the city’s top officials, has neither man been charged in connection with it? Why is it not mentioned, even obliquely, in any of the charges currently pending against them? (Both are being held on federal immigration and firearms charges and facing deportation.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And why have city government and police officials steadfastly stiff-armed persistent media requests to answer those questions and elaborate on the case?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The response from the police chief and the mayor? Double down on their claim and insist that it’s valid, the prosecutor’s contradictory statement in court under pain of perjury notwithstanding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The basis for the chief’s belief that the two men planned specifically to shoot up Dogwood Dell? Essentially, his gut. And probability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It came “from the experience and knowledge that your police department has and dealing with situations every day; of studying what happens in mass shootings, mass casualty incidents,&#8221; Smith said after the court proceeding in an</span> <a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richmond-police-chief-dogwood-dell-plot-august-03-2022" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on-camera interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with WTVR-TV in Richmond. “It comes from just your police department knowing what it&#8217;s doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s Richmond. Fourth of July celebration. It&#8217;s at the Dogwood Dell,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no paucity of Independence Day observations in Richmond, a city with its own significant contributions to the nation’s struggle for independence. Arguably better known than Dogwood Dell is the annual fireworks display after the final out of the Richmond Flying Squirrels game at The Diamond, a minor league ballpark at the opposite terminus of Arthur Ashe Boulevard from Dogwood Dell. The city’s suburbs have their own numerous public celebrations and pyrotechnics extravaganzas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turns out, we’ve been shown no more evidence for a plot targeting Dogwood Dell than we have for any other potential venue, though we’ve been implored to believe the claim absent any publicly shared substantiation beyond a conversation overheard by an earnest citizen tipster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of this is to suggest that these suspects don’t need to be sent away. They do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolman Alberto Balcarcel had been deported twice from the United States and had returned a third time when he was arrested last month. His housemate, Julio Alvarado-Dubon, is charged with illegal possession of a firearm by a person illegally in the country. He had purchased two assault-style rifles, a handgun and multiple high-capacity ammunition magazines at a yard sale near Fredericksburg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Colette McEachin last week asked the U.S. Department of Justice to take over prosecution of the men because they are “two illegal aliens with guns so we wanted them prosecuted at the highest level possible.” There was no reference to a mass shooting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did Balcarcel and Alvarado-Dubon plan to carry out a bloody assault on U.S. soil – perhaps Richmond soil? I don’t know. Clearly, they had an arsenal capable of it. The chief and the mayor say that was their intent, but nobody in authority has yet put one word of it in writing, made such a claim in a legal proceeding, or shared a shred of corroboration beyond </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">because we say so!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should not lose sight of the fact that law enforcement performed a great service by taking these two into custody based solely on the armaments seized and the wanton immigration violations alleged in court documents. They deserve our thanks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problems come not from the work officers did but from city leadership building so fantastical a narrative and announcing it so broadly yet sharing no proof to support it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The press may not be the juggernaut it once was, but there are still a lot of journalists out there who are really good at skeptically listening to a claim, methodically vetting and finding holes in it, and asking those responsible to explain the discrepancies. When those officials can’t – or won’t – the whole thing unravels pretty fast, particularly after scenes like the one in Judge Hicks’s courtroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What, for a few weeks, seemed like a much-needed PR breakthrough for city leadership in general and the police in particular has instead put both on the defensive again as Smith’s and Stoney’s sensational account falters on the verge of collapse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chief Smith, Mayor Stoney – if you’ve got the goods that you say you do tying these two guys to a mass murder plot at Dogwood Dell (or any place else), it’s time to stop stonewalling legitimate inquiries and back your claim with some verifiable proof.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At stake is the public trust and confidence necessary to govern.</span></p>

Did COVID-19 teach us nothing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last week, the</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/20/testing-and-treatment-still-limited-as-monkeypox-spreads-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Mercury’s Kate Masters revealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that Virginia was behind the curve in responding to monkeypox, a viral infection growing across the nation. The state, she reported, lacked sufficient vaccines, testing and other forms of treatment, raising the specter that the outbreak will become harder for officials to contain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sound familiar?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s set the dial on Professor Peabody’s</span> <a href="https://youtu.be/3E8zmaOiCVw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Wayback Machine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to early 2020 when the commonwealth was making its first tentative acknowledgements that an emerging contagion that had ravaged Asia, Europe and parts of the United States was actually present within its borders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In early March, having just begun her work as the Mercury’s health care reporter, Masters wrote that then-Gov. Ralph Northam, a doctor, and other leading state health officials were insisting there was</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/04/despite-limits-on-testing-capabilities-northam-says-virginia-is-prepared-for-coronavirus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">no community spread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Virginia, that somehow the risk was low from a freakishly contagious disease spread merely by inhaling where an infected person had breathed. It was a rosy assessment that, at the time, had been extrapolated from just 17 tests statewide. And it proved tragically wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t clear then, the story said, how the state would respond as the demand grew exponentially for hard-to-find tests that took a long time to deliver results. And prospects then for a vaccine or effective treatment laid many months – perhaps years – in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Northam administration’s initial response to the deadly novel coronavirus to which humans had no immunity was halting, and within a month the gravity of the pandemic in Virginia had become sobering. With severe illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths mounting, the state scrambled for protective gear for hospital staff and other medical professionals. A dearth of tests led officials to recommend that Virginians turn to private labs for testing. By the second week of April, a</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/us/coronavirus-nursing-homes.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">New York Times analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> had identified a nursing home in far western Henrico County as having the highest death toll of any long-term care facility in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the breadth and apocalyptic gravity of the disease became indisputable, Northam finally lowered the boom, ordering wholesale closings and quarantining. By then, the disease was rampant. Remarkably, that didn’t keep voices from the far-right fringe from assailing the governor for the lifesaving steps he belatedly took.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But you get the idea. The state was tardy in summoning all hands to battle stations at the dawn of the pandemic, and you can see early signs that a similar pattern may be playing out now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, some context.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The virus that causes monkeypox is a member of the family of viruses that causes smallpox. Unlike the coronavirus, it is spread by physical contact with an infected person or animal, not by mere proximity. Its symptoms include fever, headaches, chills and blistering rashes and lesions. The disease was once almost unheard of and outbreaks were largely confined to Africa. But the 2022 outbreak has seen cases spring up worldwide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As of Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed</span> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">2,891 cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the United States, or about 17 percent of the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/world-map.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">16,538 cases worldwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Only Spain, with 3,125 reported cases, had more. The Virginia Department of Health as of Friday</span> <a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/monkeypox/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">listed 64 cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> statewide, with the bulk of them, 50, in Northern Virginia. That places the commonwealth well behind the No. 1 state, New York, with 830 reported cases Friday, or even neighboring Washington, D.C., with 110, according to the CDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the reported cases are only as good as the extent of the testing, and, as Masters reported, that’s not going so well. Case counts have taken off since the first Virginia diagnosis in May, but because of limitations on testing and widespread unawareness of the presence of the previously rare virus, many infections likely aren’t getting diagnosed or reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike COVID-19, monkeypox has been around since the Beatles broke up, so there are vaccines already developed to keep it at bay. But, like tests, vaccines are frustratingly hard to find.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the Virginia Department of Health seems slow out of the blocks, it’s only mirroring an asleep-at-the-switch federal response that, as with the start of COVID-19, fails to inspire confidence. At the beginning of June, there were just a dozen monkeypox cases in the United States. Shortly before that, the White House’s coronavirus response czar, Ashish Jha, gave a facile assessment of those cases: “It is not as contagious as COVID. So, I am confident we’re going to be able to keep our arms around it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus the feds dawdled and did not marshal America’s peerless research and manufacturing might behind the effort to produce more tests, vaccines and therapeutics to help those who already have symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now,</span> <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/07/19/monkeypox-spread-many-experts-believe-the-virus-cant-be-contained/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">scientists fear</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the genie has escaped Aladdin’s lamp and isn’t going back. This weekend, the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-62279436" target="_blank">declared the outbreak a global health emergency</a>, the highest alert it can issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Advocates for LGBTQ communities wonder aloud – and with good reason – whether the response would have been more robust if monkeypox were not disproportionately afflicting those who identify as gay or bisexual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dominant vaccine, Danish-manufactured JYNNEOS, is distributed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to states. As of July 19, HHS’s Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response had dispensed 191,372 doses, according to the </span><a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov/SNS/Pages/JYNNEOS-Distribution.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">ASPR website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Virginia, as of last Wednesday, had been allotted 4,051 of those doses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feds allot doses based on case counts and likelihood of spread. That’s why Uncle Sam has sent only a dozen doses to Alabama and eight to Montana, yet California and Florida were sent more than 26,000 doses apiece and the cities of New York and Los Angeles were sent about 22,000 and 24,000, respectively. Virginia follows a similar template for dispensing its doses, meaning the lion’s share will go north of the Occoquan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While monkeypox is nowhere near the threat to life or the resilience of the health care system that COVID has been, it’s worth remembering that Virginia once took a carefree, wait-and-see attitude toward a new virus, purportedly of Chinese origin, that emerged in the deep winter weeks of 2020, dismissing the first cases as merely come-heres that hitched a ride to the commonwealth in overseas travelers and denying that the killer respiratory disease was already spreading in our communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nor is monkeypox likely to reach pandemic proportions and shut down the economy as the coronavirus did. We’re not going to see restaurants limited to takeout, cinemas shuttered, basketball seasons halted and pro football games played in empty stadiums.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this certainly would have been a good time for a country emerging from those privations to see its federal and state health agencies a little more ahead of the game for a change.</span></p>

Jack Reid, R-Henrico (Reid family)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew Del. John S. “Jack” Reid was in the building just by his unique booming voice and</span><a href="https://youtu.be/PFZqR4r6fcM" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Foghorn Leghorn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> dialect. It echoed through the marble-floored corridors of Virginia’s Capitol and even pierced the chaotic din of the press filing room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard it, I knew it was almost showtime. The House of Delegates was about to convene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess that sense of fun was what I missed about the General Assembly after Jack’s retirement in 2007. And it’s what I thought of first when I learned of his passing in </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/john.reid2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">a social media post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by his son, Richmond radio talk show host John Reid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jack was an original, larger than life. Predictably conservative and always accountable, unafraid to call out foolishness, including his own, notwithstanding its party of origin. I was not the only scribe covering the General Assembly who admired him for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He and a few of his partners in mischief along the back row of the House floor on the Republican side were a never-ending font of rollicking commentary and practical jokes that kept the chamber giggling, to the occasional vexation of multiple speakers of the House and its longtime clerk, the late Bruce Jamerson.</span></p>
<p>Jack was a founding father of the House’s “Sensitivity Caucus,” which perennially administered the eagerly awaited end-of-session rite that became known as the Pop-Up Award.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jack and his buddies – seatmate and former Del. Jack Rollison, current Majority Leader Terry Kilgore, former Del. S. Chris Jones and the late Del. Tom Gear key among them – would take careful, if imprecise, notes of delegates who felt compelled to “pop up” from their seats most frequently to hold forth on most any piece of legislation, great or trivial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once, in the punchy exhaustion of the final day of the 2000 session, Jack took the wireless center aisle microphone from the House into the men’s lavatory just off the floor. Each time the House speaker, Vance Wilkins, tried to speak, the gurgle of a flushing urinal flooded the sound system and drowned him out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then there was that time when a crusading delegate (I won’t embarrass him here) notorious for his unstinting advocacy of legislation advancing certain social causes had just finished a stemwinder on the House floor. The bill was going nowhere, but why waste a perfectly good opportunity for purple oratory?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw Jack and some of his cohorts who had heard it all too many times huddled and whispering. They enlisted the help of a woman member of their caucus to discreetly imprint her lipstick onto a blank piece of paper and write on it that she was a gallery spectator who was aroused by his speech. The note was folded and given to a House page with instructions to deliver it to the delegate in question. Jack and his posse dissolved into hopeless laughter as they watched the delegate adjust his tie and suit jacket, straighten his posture and scan the gallery for a secret admirer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We goin’ to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">hell </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">for this,” he told a co-conspirator who was doubled over laughing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not everything was fun and games. Jack</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2006/01/27/gun-toting-delegate-misfires-at-va-capitol/1174f47f-21f3-45b4-b4c4-8f54a2d1dc3f/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">made headlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> when a handgun for which he had a concealed-carry permit accidentally discharged in his General Assembly Building office as he released the clip and unloaded the weapon for storage in his desk. The round struck a bulletproof vest hanging in his office and caused no harm. Visibly shaken, Jack personally apologized to his colleagues that morning, starting with the Democratic Caucus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jack and the General Assembly of that era feel longer ago and farther away than the 15 years since he left public office. Democrats and Republicans battled over policy in his years, and Jack could be as fierce as any of them in advancing positions against government regulations, high taxes and such – even his lost cause to end the requirement that motorcyclists wear helmets, which he called “brain buckets.” But they weren’t intractable blood enemies as partisans are today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The House was a collegial body then. It was still possible to get things done across the aisle and even indulge a little mirth along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jack, your spirit made the legislature a better place. I miss you. Rest in peace.</span></p>

(Robert Zullo/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can bite off more than is good for you. That’s true whether you’re ordering a full slab of pork ribs at a Danville barbecue joint or pandering to your base in politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stridently anti-abortion Republicans in the Virginia General Assembly would do well to keep that in mind as they trip over one another in a volatile social environment rushing to introduce legislation that would effectively ban abortion in the commonwealth after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed </span><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Roe v. Wade</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> last month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Proposals from the GOP in Virginia are all over the map, from Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s opening proffer to restrict abortion to, say, the first 15 to 20 weeks of pregnancy to Republican legislators clamoring to shut down abortions from the instant of conception, no exceptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Youngkin has adapted his message to his audiences. In a videoconference with the Family Foundation of Virginia, he told members of the anti-abortion group restive over his idea of allowing abortions as late as 20 weeks that he would press for much stricter laws should the GOP take over the state Senate next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, Youngkin has been slippery on abortion since his candidacy last year when he downplayed his position on abortion publicly but was</span><a href="https://americanindependent.com/virginia-gop-gubernatorial-nominee-glenn-youngkin-abortion-views-election-independent-voters-planned-parenthood/?utm_content=bufferfe33d&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">recorded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the downlow</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> telling progressive activists posing as abortion foes that he “would start going on offense” if he won the election and gets a Republican legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/glenn-youngkin-face-the-nation-transcript-07-10-2022/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with CBS  “Face the Nation” host Robert Costa a little over a week ago, he twice pirouetted around Costa’s direct question of whether the governor would support a total abortion ban consistent with his belief that life begins at conception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not just state legislators who are weighing in. U.S. Rep. Bob Good, who represents Virginia’s 5th District, called for a no-exceptions statewide ban and chided fellow Republicans who would compromise on anything less.  Abortion,</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/congressman-bob-good-abolish-abortion-rally-richmond" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">he declared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, “should not be negotiated, it should be eliminated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it’s not just legislation that Republicans are pursuing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Multiple outlets have reported that Del. Dave LaRock, R-Loudoun, is recommending to Youngkin that he withhold funding from hospitals at state-supported universities that provide abortion services, even though the procedure is fully legal in Virginia. And the Richmond Times-Dispatch quoted LaRock as saying that Youngkin is “paying close attention” to his request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Youngkin’s press secretary, Macaulay Porter, declined to address whether the governor was specifically considering LaRock’s suggestion. In text messages from Buchanan County where Youngkin viewed flash flood devastation on Friday, she wrote: “the governor’s office has heard from several legislators on the issue of abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Republicans are now, as Youngkin said, “going on offense” in trying to pare back abortion access after last month’s</span><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/19-1392" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> decision is unsurprising. Some states dominated by GOP governors and legislatures were primed and ready before the ruling, having already passed “trigger laws” that would outlaw abortion in those states as soon as the Supreme Court ruled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Until January, when a Republican majority overtook the House of Delegates and Youngkin succeeded Gov. Ralph Northam, Democrats held utter control of policymaking in Virginia and, in their two years of partisan hegemony, they repealed many abortion restrictions the GOP imposed over two prior decades. Republicans, particularly those representing culturally and politically conservative rural districts, made it clear they plan to roll back the clock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But to the 1920s?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Republican lawmakers from outside Virginia’s vast eastern swath of suburbia have nothing to lose doubling, even tripling down on abortion prohibitions. While Youngkin supports exemptions for victims of rape and incest or to protect a woman’s life imperiled by a pregnancy, a good many Republicans don’t. Good, who favors “no exceptions,”  is among them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a time when rape and incest exceptions were accepted standards of compassion among most Republicans. Rigid absolutism on abortion, driven by the party’s hard-right conservative base – those who dominate primaries – has since gripped the GOP. Recent examples abound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesli Vega, the Republican nominee challenging Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger for her 7th District seat in Virginia, was</span><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1541379792246902784" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">caught on a recording</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> last month dismissing the likelihood of women becoming pregnant from rape. It’s essentially the same</span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8765248" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">medically discredited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> claim that ended the career of</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/video/2012/08/todd-akin-legitimate-rape-victims-rarely-get-pregnant-011369" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Rep. Todd Akin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, R-Mo., in 2012. Vega, a police officer, said on the recording that she had “worked one case where, as a result of a rape, the young woman became pregnant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim had to go to neighboring Indiana to end her pregnancy because Ohio’s new abortion ban grants no rape exception, even for a child in elementary school, GOP elected officials and right-wing media called it a lie. Then authorities arrested a 27-year-old man and arraigned him last week in the attack on the child. U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, deleted a tweet labeling the claim false, but</span><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jim-jordan-has-no-regrets-for-calling-10-year-old-rape-victims-abortion-a-lie?ref=home" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">refused to apologize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Mississippi, the Republican speaker of the state House of Representatives, Philip Gunn, said it should be</span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WDAMTV/videos/324358513234878/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">illegal for a girl of 12 to terminate a pregnancy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> arising from molestation by her father or uncle. Mississippi’s abortion law allows rape and life-of-mother exemptions but, pointedly, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> one for incest. Gunn opposes an incest exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Republican North Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, in a</span><a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1543591991220572160" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">CNN interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> defending her state’s anti-abortion trigger law with no exception for pediatric pregnancies, dissembled when host Dana Bash asked her if a 10-year-old girl should be forced to carry a rapist’s fetus to term. She condemned the man charged in the crime, noted that her state’s law allows exceptions only for a mother’s life, and said she opposes further exemptions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">State and national polls have long shown that majorities support a right to legal abortions. But the issue is nuanced, not binary, as indicated in a statewide</span><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/about/news/rc_poll_politics_june_2022" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Roanoke College poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from May. Fifty-three percent of respondents said abortion should be legal some of the time compared with just 35 percent who said it should be legal in all cases. Only 11 percent said it should be illegal in all circumstances. The poll, conducted days after POLITICO published a leaked draft opinion revealing that the Supreme Court was poised to end half a century of federal legal protection for abortions, found that 57 percent disagreed with the decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Years of polling shows that the more extreme abortion policy gets – whether it be banning the procedure totally or allowing it almost up to birth – the less support it has. The U.S. electorate’s vast majority prefers a measured middle ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frothing-at-the-mouth anti-abortion fervor may work for rural legislators. But their rhetoric doesn’t stop at their district boundaries. What may earn them a pat on the back in rural Virginia is toxic to Republicans in suburban or exurban swing districts for U.S. House seats this year and state legislative seats in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Abortion alone is unlikely to determine outcomes either of those years. A troubled economy with the worst inflation in more than 40 years along with President Joe Biden’s plunging popularity favors the GOP, certainly this year. But the issues of abortion and gun control will carry extraordinary motivational power this fall, particularly among Democrats given the Supreme Court’s decisions to cripple abortion rights and loosen gun restrictions, even as the country averages almost</span><a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">two mass shootings per day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> so far this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s valid to note that abortion rights had marginal sway in previous elections, including last year’s, perhaps because the threat to those rights was hypothetical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This year, at least in Virginia, it’s existential.</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="800" height="534" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1241501544-e1656107035601.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Abortion-rights activist Jamie McIntyre reacts to the 6-3 ruling in Dobbs v.

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Americans have always held, as a matter of faith, that if they don’t like something, at least they have the freedom to raise hell about it. At a minimum, it makes them feel better – like they’ve </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">done</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> something. There’s even the possibility that it might lead to change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it became clear that the war in Vietnam was floundering and that the Pentagon was shoveling the best and brightest of our youth — most conscripted against their will — into the killing fields of an undeclared, stalemated war, protests convulsed the nation. The more the government tried to mute them, the louder and more numerous they got.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took a dozen years and three presidencies, but in 1975, with domestic support for the war nil, the last U.S. troops left Vietnam and use of the military draft was discontinued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The vicious 1992 beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police and George Floyd’s curbside killing 28 years later by a Minneapolis cop who blithely ignored pleas from horrified onlookers for nine minutes were both captured on video. Both times, images of Black men being savaged by White officers sent pent-up rage from four centuries of injustice spilling into the streets from sea to shining sea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those flashpoints forced introspection as a nation into the historic and continuing inequities visited upon Black Americans and, after Floyd’s death, brought</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1280" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">incremental changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to policing procedures. It forced the removal of Jim Crow-era totems of White supremacy in numerous cities, especially Richmond where statues celebrating leaders of a treasonous enemy of the United States were at last dismantled along Monument Avenue, until recently the world’s largest collection of consolation prizes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In May, the leak of a draft</span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/19-1392" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">U.S. Supreme Court ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that would, weeks later, reverse the court’s 49-year-old precedent guaranteeing women the legal right to abort unwanted pregnancies touched off protests nationwide, particularly near the Supreme Court building and outside the Fairfax County, Virginia, home of the author of the majority opinion that struck down the</span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/roe_v_wade_(1973)" target="_blank"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">Roe v. Wade</span></i></a> <span style="font-weight: 400">decision, Justice Samuel Alito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among the protesters’ messages for the justices: images of coat hangers, a grisly reminder of a day when those were instruments of illegal abortions before </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Roe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> established a right of privacy that covered abortions. Protest placards read: “No privacy for us, no peace for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, though, the outlook for protesters is uncertain and complicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some authorities are actively trying to suppress public demonstrations outside the homes of the justices, and there is</span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1507" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">a federal law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that unambiguously empowers police to do just that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Granted, nobody wants crowds picketing, chanting, waving signs and using bullhorns outside their homes – the refuge for themselves and their families. The protests in question target the court’s conservative majority. The nine jurists on the court hold unmatched legal authority and lifetime sinecures during which to exercise it — their decisions are the final word on any legal dispute arising in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nor is it an extraordinary leap to imagine someone might attempt violence against a judge or officer of the court. In June, an armed California man</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/08/kavanaugh-threat-arrest-justice/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">arrested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> near Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s Chevy Chase, Maryland, home told police that he was suicidal and intended to kill Kavanaugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Further, it’s beyond dispute that the justice system collapses at every level if outside forces are allowed to intimidate or corruptly influence judges, so some level of security is necessary for judges. On July 1, Gail Curley, the marshal of the Supreme Court, sent letters to Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan as well as the top officials in the Washington, D.C., suburbs of Fairfax County, Virginia, and Montgomery County, Maryland, imploring each to strictly enforce local and state laws to halt the protests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those laws seem destined to collide with the clear language of the U.S. Constitution. And if that happens, could the ultimate decision reside with the very justices who would have to weigh their own peace and comfort against the First Amendment?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The answer is yes, though it has already,” said longtime First Amendment lawyer Michael A. Bamberger who recalled a 1965 opinion that upheld a Louisiana law modeled on the current federal statute and found constitutional, even though it reversed a conviction obtained under the state law because it had been improperly applied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Along with assuring the freedoms of religion, speech and the press, the First Amendment also expressly guarantees “the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” The framers added no codicils of qualifiers: no asterisks, footnotes, exceptions or subsections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over time in the United States, the rights of assembly and the right to petition have “been subsumed” into the right to expression, said Bamberger, a senior counsel with the law firm Dentons who has tried more than 100 First Amendment cases. “And that’s interesting because the right to petition goes all the way back to the Magna Carta and was considered very important to the people who wrote the Declaration of Independence.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The test would likely be whether the laws squelch expression based on what is being said, according to Gabe Walters, a Richmond-based attorney with</span><a href="https://www.thefire.org/about-us/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">FIRE</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is well established that the First Amendment protects peaceful political protest on public property. Whether imposed by federal law or not, any restrictions on peaceful protest on public property must be narrowly drawn to further a significant governmental interest and be content neutral,” Walters said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Laws in Maryland and Virginia have already been questioned by officials in those states, who said as much in their responses to Curley’s letter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The law cited in the letter is a likely violation of the First Amendment, and a previous court case refused to enforce it,” said Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jeff McKay. A separate statement from the Fairfax County Police Department said its Civil Disturbance Unit is skilled at providing “a safe space for individuals to exercise First Amendment rights and also maintain community safety.”</span></p>

Wade decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion. (States Newsroom D.C. Bureau)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hogan’s spokesman</span><a href="https://twitter.com/riccimike/status/1543313595563495424/photo/1" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">tweeted Maryland’s response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, noting that Attorney General Merrick Garland, the nation’s top law-enforcement officer, had already declined a</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/05/12/protests-youngkin-hogan-justices-abortion/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">written request made jointly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by Hogan and Youngkin to use federal assets to enforce the federal law. In a pointed rebuke to Curley, the spokesman continued: “Had the marshal taken the time to explore the matter, she would have learned that the constitutionality of the statute cited in her letter has been questioned by the Maryland Attorney General’s Office.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bamberger questions whether a claim that protests are an attempt to influence the court can now be valid. The court has ruled on hot-button issues such as abortion, gun-rights, public school prayer and gutting federal power to regulate pollution from power plants and is recessed until a new term begins in October. How, he said, can protests now against those decisions be construed as undue influence?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In early May, after POLITICO published the leaked draft but before the final ruling had been issued, Youngkin struck an ideal balance in melding a cooperative state and local police response to demonstrations outside Alito’s home that shielded the justice and his family and protected the rights of those peaceably assembled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Youngkin’s response to Curley’s letter was to agree with her contention that “threatening activity outside the justices’ homes has increased,” but argue that the duty resides mostly with Fairfax County and the feds, bluntly imploring Garland to “do his job by enforcing the much more robust federal law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Every resource of federal law enforcement, including the U.S. Marshals, should be involved while the Justices continue to be denied the right to live peacefully in their homes,” read a statement from Youngkin’s office. “The governor remains in regular contact with the justices themselves and holds their safety as an utmost priority.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So there’s no clear forecast for what awaits those who protest within earshot of a justice’s home. The answer from bright legal minds: “We shall see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Free expression has not fared so well recently in the courts or elsewhere in government but shrinking from the challenge and meekly acquiescing is the wrong response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The answer must come from a place of principled patriotism and the courage to dissent, not from guessing what the court might do. Our republic is never well-served by allowing the First Amendment to atrophy from disuse.</span></p>

Wade. (Kate Masters/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Marshall got what he wanted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a generation as a Republican member of the House of Delegates from Prince William, Marshall was the foremost anti-abortion voice in Virginia government until he lost his seat in 2017 to Democratic Del. Danica Roem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every legislative session during Marshall’s tenure saw a flurry of bills from his pen that would crimp access to abortion in Virginia – some successful, others going too far even for fellow Republicans who ruled the General Assembly at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His real goal – outlawing it – got a lot closer to reality when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the 197</span>3 <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18" target="_blank">Roe v. Wade</a> precedent that kept abortion clinics in Virginia open and Marshall and legislative anti-abortion crusaders at bay.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, absent federal court protection, abortion rights are determined state by state, with many – mostly in the Deep South – already severely restricting or even banning the procedure. Virginia is not among them, but that may not last much longer. And if or when that happens, women and families with the least will suffer the most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of Thursday, bans were in place in 20 states, and abortion remained legal in 19 states plus the District of Columbia, according to a</span> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-ruling-states-a767801145ad01617100e57410a0a21d" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state-by-state count of abortion laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by The Associated Press. Virginia was listed among 11 states where the issue remains to be determined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirteen of the states that now ban or sharply restrict abortions had “trigger laws” on the books waiting to take effect as soon as the Supreme Court released its </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruling. In those states, except for a few where court challenges have enjoined the law from taking effect, abortion clinics were forced to close immediately. In some states, the law would make a felon of any doctor who performed an abortion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ink hadn’t yet dried on the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dobbs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> decision before Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin called for new legislation restricting abortion access in Virginia. Details he has offered publicly are still vague, but he has said he would sign whatever limiting legislation the General Assembly sends him and expressed an interest in cutting off abortions after 15 to 20 weeks of gestation with exceptions for victims of rape and incest and to protect the life of the mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not exactly what he’s telling abortion opponents from the other side of his mouth. The</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/29/youngkin-abortion-life-conception/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Thursday that in an online forum with the Family Foundation of Virginia, Youngkin called the 15-week cutoff he proffered just a first step to put something palatable before a divided General Assembly, but said he would push for stricter limits as political conditions might allow later. During the forum, the Post reported, he acknowledged that a 15-week ban “won’t be the bill we all want,” adding that he believes “life begins at inception” – a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">faux pas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his spokeswoman later corrected to “conception.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s what you can do with the folks that you have,” Marshall said in a telephone chat last week, acknowledging the limitations of the current partisan legislative split.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a candidate, Youngkin tried to keep his antipathy for abortion rights on the down-low, but</span><a href="https://americanindependent.com/virginia-gop-gubernatorial-nominee-glenn-youngkin-abortion-views-election-independent-voters-planned-parenthood/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">hidden camera</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> subterfuge by progressive activists posing as abortion foes blew that up. In a covertly recorded conversation, Youngkin said he had to soft-pedal his position on abortion to win independent votes he would need to get elected, but once he’s governor with a Republican legislature, he confided, “then we can go on offense.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He got part of what he wanted last November with his victory over Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an abortion rights supporter, in the governor’s race and a Republican takeover of the House. Democrats still hold 21 of the Senate’s 40 seats, but the swing vote on abortion issues would be Sen. Joe Morrissey, a pro-life Democrat. Assuming any legislation yields a party-line 20-20 vote with Morrissey siding with the GOP, fiercely pro-life Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears would cast the decisive vote, returning women’s reproductive rights in Virginia closer to what they were before 1973.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a time when women living on or below the margins financially had little choice but to carry their pregnancies to term and forfeit opportunities while wealthier women could jet away to locales where abortion was safe and legal and “get it taken care of” discreetly, preserving their social standing and their educational and career options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s what post-Roe America will resemble. Even while Roe was in force, women at or beneath the federal poverty level were disproportionately driven to seek out abortion services, according to</span><a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/characteristics-us-abortion-patients-2014" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Guttmacher Institute. In 2014, the study found, three-fourths of patients were low-income: 49 percent at or below the federal poverty level and 26 percent at or slightly above it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, with abortions banned, many women and their families on the cusp of penury will likely slip deeper into helplessness and hopelessness. One comprehensive multi-year study conducted at the University of California-San Francisco looked at 1,000 women who sought abortions at 30 clinics in 21 states. The research, which began in 2008 and is known as “</span><a href="https://www.ansirh.org/research/ongoing/turnaway-study" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Turnaway Study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” compared outcomes for women who were able to have abortions and women who sought them but were turned away by providers because they were too far along in their pregnancies to qualify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By tracking those women with semiannual telephone surveys for five years, the study’s researchers found that women who were turned away experienced more detrimental financial, health and family outcomes. </span><a href="https://www.ansirh.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/the_harms_of_denying_a_woman_a_wanted_abortion_4-16-2020.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them:</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Women denied a wanted abortion who were forced to give birth were four times more likely than women in the survey who received abortions to live below the federal poverty level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted that pro-life advocates vigorously dispute the study’s findings and assert that abortion causes far greater harm to women in addition to their seminal argument that the process terminates what would be a human life. In rebuttal, they cite various papers</span><a href="https://lozierinstitute.org/three-fabrications-of-roe/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">like this one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the alleged ancillary harms, all produced by pro-life organizations.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Virginia doesn’t act to restrict abortion access, bans in neighboring states will make it more difficult to obtain abortions for Virginians. </span>Tennessee and Kentucky have already enacted abortion bans (although a court challenge in Kentucky has stayed enforcement of that state’s law), and some conservative lawmakers in North Carolina <a href="https://www.wfae.org/health/2022-07-01/heres-who-would-be-impacted-by-a-20-week-abortion-ban-in-north-carolina" target="_blank">want the state</a> to enforce a 20-week ban that&#8217;s been on the books since the 1970s but has been stymied by Roe.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expectant women from those states cross into Virginia, where abortion is still legal, the influx will dramatically increase caseloads for Virginia’s providers, forcing longer waits for appointments for women whose pregnancies are already approaching the point of fetal viability past which elective abortions can no longer be performed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is not a hotbed for abortions,</span><a href="https://data.guttmacher.org/states/table?state=AL+AK+AZ+AR+CA+CO+CT+DE+DC+FL+GA+HI+ID+IL+IN+IA+KS+KY+LA+ME+MD+MA+MI+MN+MS+MO+MT+NE+NV+NH+NJ+NM+NY+NC+ND+OH+OK+OR+PA+RI+SC+SD+TN+TX+UT+VT+VA+WA+WV+WI+WY&amp;topics=66&amp;dataset=data" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Guttmacher Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a research and policy nonprofit focused on reproductive health</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2017, the most recent year for which complete data are available, Virginia’s abortion rate was 10.2 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, ranking the commonwealth 25th nationally. The 17,210 abortions performed in Virginia that year accounted for just 2 percent of the more than 862,360 abortions performed nationally. The District of Columbia, New Jersey, New York and Maryland, in that order, had the four highest abortion rates that year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tannis Fuller sees firsthand the urgent desperation women in crisis seeking abortions experience. As executive director of the Blue Ridge Abortion Fund, which last year provided more than $600,000 to nearly 1,900 women who needed assistance, it’s her job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Life will get even tougher for the poor, many of them minorities, if Virginia restricts or ultimately bans abortion, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Any time someone doesn&#8217;t have the financial means to access abortion it can be devastating,” Fuller wrote in an email response to an inquiry from the Mercury. “If the General Assembly makes abortion illegal after 15 or 20 weeks (of) gestation, we will most certainly see patients who need care later in pregnancy needing additional financial support to access care in states where it is still available, most likely Washington, D.C., Maryland, New Jersey, or New York.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of it as trickle-down inequity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those with the financial means will once again get inconvenient pregnancies in their proper, comfortable households discreetly dispensed with, just as they did 50 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The privations and pain, meanwhile, will pool knee-deep for the masses in America’s  socioeconomic basement who can least afford it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as they did 50 years ago.</span></p>

The "part-time" legislative model isn't working anymore and everyone knows it, Bob Lewis argues. (Virginia Mercury file photo by Graham Moomaw)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">You hear it regularly on Capitol Square in Virginia: Ours is a “part-time” legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not really.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not for years and years now, either in fact or by definition. But it sure evokes wistful nostalgia in presentations loaded with gauzy clichés about “the Virginia way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Look no further than this year’s long-running session in which the General Assembly came 13 days from being without a new budget in time for the start of Fiscal Year 2023 on Friday. That was extraordinary, even for legislators accustomed to extra innings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The biennial task of cobbling together from scratch a two-year spending blueprint for state government remained unfinished when time ran out in March on the regular General Assembly session limited by the state Constitution to no more than 60 days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Building the budget is a Herculean assignment and attempting it in just two winter months beggars the expertise and endurance of accomplished professional staffs and legislative laymen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So again, as it has done for the </span>past five years in a row,<span style="font-weight: 400"> the legislature called a special session in 2022 to finish business left over from a mid-winter legislative work period – a timetable designed for Virginia as it was a century ago, when tobacco was king, most every town had a passenger train depot and everything west of Arlington and south of Alexandria, was for farming or hunting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The business of legislating this year didn’t necessarily end when the House of Delegates and Senate completed work on Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s amendments to the state budget on June 17. Instead of adjourning </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">sine die</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, the General Assembly recessed a session that will extend into September – effectively eight months of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pardon the comparison, but doesn’t that sound a little like … </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Congress</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time has come for a state as dynamic, wealthy and essential to national commerce and American global leadership as Virginia to part with an anachronistic model for enacting policy. Virginia deserves a longer-running, better compensated, less time-stressed legislative model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">None of this is a knock on our legislators. And it’s not really a knock on a system that served the commonwealth pretty well until the latter years of the 20th century. If anything, it’s a knock on Virginia’s notorious resistance to change, even when that change is necessary to provide our elected leaders the time to fully grasp the issues besetting our state and get policymaking right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s impossible to precisely compare how many days the 50 U.S. legislatures are in session each year and definitively rank them because not all states prescribe specific dates or numbers of days, according to</span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Dates_of_2021_state_legislative_sessions" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">information compiled by Ballotpedia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Virginia’s regular session, however, is among the briefest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The National Conference of State Legislatures</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/full-and-part-time-legislatures.aspx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">classifies Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as one of 26 states with a “hybrid” legislature, a murky middle ground between the 14 part-time legislatures with low pay and small staffs and the 10 full-time assemblies with greater pay and smaller staffs. But the NCSL also notes that</span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/about-state-legislatures/the-legislative-pay-problem636360604.aspx" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">salaries for Virginia lawmakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are among the lowest nationally at $18,000 for senators and $17,460 for delegates, not counting $211 per diem for each legislative day. West Virginia, with one-fifth of Virginia’s population,</span><a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Comparison_of_state_legislative_salaries?msclkid=a8b9e1a9a63111ecab2e19478f4f09b4" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">pays its legislators a $20,000</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> annual stipend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Virginia is the nation’s 12th most-populous state. Six of the 11 larger states have full-time legislatures as do four smaller ones, according to the NCSL. There are larger states, however, even more mired in the past. Texas legislators convene every other year and receive only $7,200 annually.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mark Rozell, dean of George Mason University’s Schar School of Government and Politics who focuses on Virginia, noted in a</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/21/virginias-legislature-was-built-agrarian-times-is-it-time-an-update/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Washington Post op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in March that Virginia’s rapid, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural population explosion in recent decades in addition to the increased speed at which business is transacted and information moves has made governing Virginia more complicated than anyone could have imagined 50 years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We need to get past the fiction that a very part-time legislative body working with a lame-duck governor can get the job done on time,” Rozell said in an interview last week, aptly observing that the problem is compounded in Virginia because it is the only state that prohibits back-to-back terms for its governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How many more years consecutively can we see a legislature going into multiple special sessions before we acknowledge that it’s not working as it used to?” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A look at the</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?213+oth+MTG&amp;213+oth+MTG" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">General Assembly’s Legislative Information System</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> website shows that it has called special sessions to finish its work in 15 of the 23 legislative years since 2000. In four of them, including last year, it required more than one special session. Those figures alone demonstrate the need for a more expansive, dedicated and better resourced legislative system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this year’s regular legislative session, the House and Senate punted 47 bills into the current special session, including two budget bills – one that wraps up the current fiscal year that ends on Thursday and a $165 billion budget that begins when the clock strikes midnight. Of those bills, 21 won final passage on June 17, according to the LIS.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most years, extra sessions are necessitated by the budget, the single most important piece of legislation enacted in any year. Not only does the budget direct scores of billions of dollars in state spending, its provisions supersede other statutes. That’s why Youngkin attempted to insert budget amendments that would establish a three-month gasoline tax holiday, create new felonies for demonstrations targeted at judges and deny state aid to help poor women pay for abortions when incapacitating fetal disabilities are diagnosed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite their importance, budgets are the driest legislation of any session. For years, the task fell to me to keep an eye on the dozen or so senators and delegates sequestered in stuffy Capitol Square office suites dickering over differences between House and Senate versions of the budget. Many nights, they dickered into the wee hours, and I stuck it out with them. Sometimes they’d shake hands on a deal just hours away from final adjournment. A remarkable cadre of sleep-starved staff accountants and analysts was left to pull an all-nighter transcribing their compromise into written amendments, preparing summaries called “half-sheets” to be placed on the desks of all 140 legislators,  and briefing them on the changes by noon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a testament to the money committee staffs’ stamina and skill that there were no serious math or drafting errors in final printed documents nearly two inches thick. But while the spirit is willing, humans have limitations and sooner or later, the run of good fortune will expire as both the astonishing sums of money and the complexity of allocating them compounds with each succeeding biennium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The system as it exists made sense in an earlier time with a smaller, less diverse population, an agrarian economy and a political ethic that the less government does, the better,” Rozell said. “Any constitutional scholar (who is) asked to design a governmental system for such a state (as modern Virginia) would never say, ‘I have a great idea: let’s do a very part-time legislature with a lame-duck governor!’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can’t imagine that they would pick the system that we have today,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jonathan would have blended into the diffuse background of the 2001 governor’s race as far as Virginia’s senior political correspondents at the time were concerned but for the fact that, at seemingly every stop, he sought us out. He hovered like a horsefly. He noticed everything. He engaged the gray-hairs of the press corps in conversation and asked us about the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He filled a variety of roles – driver, body man, tracker – for the campaign of Mark L. Earley, the state attorney general and Republican nominee for governor. I’d have written him off as just another partisan, except that he didn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">behave</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> like one. He seemed to be methodically studying the system writ large, analyzing it from the inside out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No memory is more vivid than Labor Day of that year – a sweltering, grotesquely humid late morning in the village of Buena Vista after its parade, once an obligatory event for statewide political nominees. Back then, campaigns were somewhat somnolent in the summers (“the Virginia way”) and the BV parade was among a handful of Labor Day weekend events including Sunday’s Acres of Democrats in Wytheville, a Monday parade in Covington and Rep. Bobby Scott’s annual picnic in Newport News. They kicked off the nine-week autumn sprint to Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Buena Vista parade would step off after GOP and Democratic breakfasts in the city’s business district, course through streets lined with families perched on their porches or curbside lawn chairs amid a thicket of campaign yard signs, turn right on West 10th Street by the old Parry McCluer High football field, cross the bridge over the Maury River, then culminate at an open-air pavilion in Glen Maury Park where each candidate got the microphone for a few minutes to</span><a href="https://youtu.be/GJBsDnLXtPo" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">court the electorate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once finished, candidates were consumed in a media scrum that would envelop them from every direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mark Warner, the Democrat and eventual winner of 2001’s gubernatorial election, had alighted from the stage and was swarmed by scribes who pushed recorders or microphones as close as possible to his mouth to clearly capture his words over the din of the nearby crowd. Among those craning forward with a recorder was Jonathan, acting as Earley’s tracker – a campaign staffer who records firsthand audio (now video) of an opponent in hopes of exploiting a gaffe. Someone jostled Jonathan’s arm and his recorder inadvertently brushed Warner’s lip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dave “Mudcat” Saunders was advising Warner’s campaign on its rural strategy that year. Among his ideas was entering a Warner-logo car in a</span><a href="https://us.motorsport.com/automotive/news/jon-wood-martinsville-sponsorship-announcement/1871202/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">NASCAR event</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Martinsville and a</span><a href="https://youtu.be/BchLv9B_Gj8" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">bluegrass-themed campaign song</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> set to the tune of the Dillards’ “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/_6_hXjOBAMI" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Dooley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.” Mudcat was on the periphery of the gaggle and saw red when Jonathan’s recorder nudged Warner’s face. He grabbed Jonathan and tried to yank him from the scrum. Nothing came of it more than a few angry glares and muttered oaths, which was probably fortunate for Mudcat considering Jonathan’s youth and size advantage. Most striking, however, was the speed with which Jonathan shook it off and regained his focus, just as any member of the press corps should have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mudcat, a colorful former newspaperman not known for self-censorship, was later remorseful and, when I recalled the incident years afterward, said in his mountain drawl: “Ah felt shi**y ’bout how ah treated that boy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That memory replayed itself last week as I sat in a group of people listening to Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns, both New York Times national political correspondents, discuss their new bestseller, “This Will Not Pass.” Their national book-promotion tour brought them to Richmond where they did a Q&amp;A about their work documenting former President Donald Trump’s aberrant behavior in the 2020 campaign and his alarming efforts to stay in power by any means after losing to President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nobody in 2001 could have pegged</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jmartNYT" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">JMart</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to surmount the ziggurat of American journalism as he has. He found his way into the profession at Hotline, the political newsletter of the National Journal, then got in on the ground floor of POLITICO in 2007 before joining the Times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But he is hardly unique among journalists who’ve risen to national prominence from inauspicious Virginia roots. The late Roger Mudd started a career at the Richmond News Leader that would make him a primary CBS News political correspondent and, for two years, co-moderator of NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Mudd’s Washington &amp; Lee classmate, the late Tom Wolfe, was a Richmond native who worked at the Washington Post before becoming an early pioneer of the “New Journalism” which employs a novelist’s storytelling style in nonfiction books. Vivid examples are Wolfe’s classics, “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test” and “The Right Stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Carl Bernstein, who co-bylined the Post’s legendary coverage of Watergate and the Nixon White House and co-authored “All the President’s Men” with Bob Woodward, was the Post’s Richmond-based Virginia government correspondent in the early 1970s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are more recent stories involving my contemporaries. You can’t watch CNN’s coverage of Congress or the White House without seeing correspondent Ryan Nobles, an alumnus of Richmond’s WWBT-TV who covered Virginia government. A fellow alum of Ryan’s at WWBT, Aaron Gilchrist, is now a network anchor at NBC News. Peter Baker, Mike Shear and Anita Kumar were once the Post’s chief Capitol Square correspondents: Baker and Shear are now top Washington correspondents for the Times, and Kumar is POLITICO’s chief White House correspondent and associate editor. Jo Becker, who covered state government with Shear, is a three-time Pulitzer winner at the Times. Maria Sanminiatelli, who worked at the Daily Progress in Charlottesville before joining me on the Associated Press staff in Richmond, now directs AP’s Top Stories Hub in New York. Joe St. George, formerly of WTVR-TV in Richmond, is now the Washington-based national political editor for Scripps Television. Michael Paul Williams won a Pulitzer last year for columns he wrote at the Richmond Times-Dispatch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m sure I’ve missed many, and for that oversight I apologize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The point being: you never know where talent, hard work and a bright, inquiring young mind can take people in this business. Which brings me to the present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may have read recently of staff transitions at the Virginia Mercury. That’s relevant because in 44 years in the journalism and communications business, working with many amazingly gifted colleagues, I’ve never been associated with an organization as strong wall to wall, ceiling to floor as this one. (Full disclosure: I am not on the Mercury staff.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Past Mercury staffers Mechelle Hankerson, now the news director at WHRO, and Katie O&#8217;Connor, senior staff writer at Psychiatric News, have gone on to big things. Ned Oliver, a news virtuoso who was named <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-mercury-wins-honors-in-press-competition/" target="_blank">Virginia&#8217;s outstanding journalist in 2021</a> for his work with the Mercury, decamped to join a new Richmond-based publication of Axios. Kate Masters, who joined the Mercury at the start of the pandemic and differentiated and distinguished it with her state-specific health care and education coverage in a time of unprecedented tumult, is moving to New York. She was named<a href="https://www.vpa.net/articles/virginia-press-association-names-virginia-mercury-reporter-2021-outstanding-young-journalist/" target="_blank"> Virginia&#8217;s outstanding young journalist</a> for her work last year. And Robert Zullo, a masterful journalist and the maestro who assembled this remarkable team as the Mercury’s founding editor, is moving to Illinois where he will write about national energy policy for States Newsroom, the Mercury’s owner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A parting testament to Zullo&#8217;s stewardship is the fact that he turns the keys over to Sarah Vogelsong, an excellent journalist whom he hired and who has become Virginia’s authoritative voice on environmental and energy policy coverage.</span><a href="http://www.sarahvogelsong.com/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Sarah</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, who got her start at a Virginia weekly, will be editor-in-chief of the Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Mercury is doing what few news organizations can these days: it’s hiring, replacing talent that’s moving up the ladder. Staying at Sarah’s side will be Graham Moomaw, who holds the Mercury’s cornerstone beat as its legislative/governmental/political writer. Graham’s reporting and storytelling skills are equal to or better than any of my aforementioned colleagues who’ve shot on to national stardom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a career that has spanned parts of six decades, I’ve sadly lifted many a glass toasting those who’ve advanced, retired or moved on. Years removed from the frenzied competition and deadlines of daily reporting, seeing colleagues excel and ascend brings a deep satisfaction as time passes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Twenty-one years passed between the time my orbit intersected with Jonathan’s and the evening </span><span style="font-weight: 400">last week</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> when I told him publicly how proud I am of what he’s accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I am this side of the sod and of sufficiently sound mind and body in another 21 years, I hope to say the same to the rising young stars I’ve been blessed to know as a Mercury contributor.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin signs legislation in February ending school mask mandates. His proposed amendments to recently passed legislation would give Virginia's state health commissioner total discretion over local health director appointments, a change some worry could undermine trust in public health authority. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On some level, the notion is understandable and meritorious. Old-school management wants to see employees at their desks ready to go on time, bright-eyed, dressed for success and brimming with enthusiasm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, perhaps thinking old school, Gov. Glenn Youngkin saw merit in his May 3 dictate that all state employees who’ve been working from home for more than two years shall return to their 9-to-5 lives in state office buildings by July 5 unless they’ve requested and been granted waivers, in some cases with approval necessary from the most senior aide to the governor himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You read that right. It’s not a misprint. Here’s the plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose an auditor or procurement specialist or data technician in some state agency wants to work from home a day a week. Under Youngkin’s decree, that is a decision that only the statewide director of that agency can make. If the employee requests two days, the request is escalated to the relevant secretary in Youngkin’s cabinet. Those with the temerity to seek three or more days a week working remotely would have to get dispensation directly from Younkin’s chief of staff, Jeff Goettman. Employees had to tender those requests, citing health or personal reasons, by May 20.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right away, this masterwork of micromanagement belied any suggestion that efficiency drove the policy. An unwieldy construct that defies scalability, it seemed inevitable that Team Youngkin would blow right through its self-imposed June 3 deadline for vetting those employee requests –</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/06/03/glenn-youngkin-telework-virginia-governor-deadline/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and it did</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as a candidate, Youngkin made clear his antipathy for the protocols and precautions that the coronavirus necessitated starting in early 2020. It’s very popular with the Republican base, by the way: be done with masks, get kids back into classrooms, make vaccines optional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, truth be told, it feels </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">damn</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indulging the idea that this fast-mutating virus from hell took its best shot and, a million or so U.S. deaths later, we’re still going. It was nice on a recent flight to and from California knowing that we passengers could pull down our masks without risking a mile-high imbroglio or to belly up to the bar last week at a favored watering hole I hadn’t visited since February 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But those safeguards, despised though some were, clearly saved lives and kept our hospitals and medical care infrastructure from collapsing until science and the America’s unparalleled manufacturing might, set at full throttle by the Trump White House, produced enough vaccines in record time to turn the tide in the fight against the illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those safeguards was working from home. And a strange thing happened in those many months when business districts in Richmond, Norfolk, Alexandria, Roanoke and elsewhere became ghost towns: productivity from staff working remotely did not suffer. In fact, it held its own and, in many cases, improved, according to a</span><a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/us-remote-work-survey.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 workplace survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the global accounting and business services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report said that businesses would gradually bring more people back into the office as companies moved toward a flexible hybrid office model where many workers would rotate in and out of shared spaces in an office, allowing workers to blend time on-site with colleagues and others to telecommute. The model makes them less a prisoner to the clock and empowers them to balance the personal and the professional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, not all jobs can be done anywhere you can find an internet connection. Buses, Ubers, 18-wheelers and jetliners don’t drive themselves (</span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/21/why-the-first-autonomous-vehicles-winners-wont-be-in-your-driveway.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">yet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and nobody’s figured out how to do it using a joystick from mom’s basement. The pandemic rightly made heroes of nurses and doctors and orderlies who risked (and sometimes lost) their own lives during the contagion’s darkest days in an often futile fight to save strangers’ lives. Highways have to be paved, burst pipes and HVAC systems have to be fixed, fires have to be extinguished and bad guys have to be arrested. You can’t do that from your sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the information marketplace, many professionals have found the independence of telework liberating and motivating. Others, however, found it distracting and confining and yearned for a return to the old normal of the office where they feel more productive, according to</span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/02/16/covid-19-pandemic-continues-to-reshape-work-in-america/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a recent study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Pew Research Center, a nonprofit and nonpartisan think tank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It showed that 59 percent of workers whose jobs can be performed remotely have chosen that option all or most of the time even as their offices reopen. But while 64 percent said it improved their work/personal life balance, six in 10 said they felt less connected to colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as offices reopen – still mindful that a new variant of the virus could scuttle everything in a matter of weeks – the allure of telework has been a powerful tool for employers in intellect- and data-heavy industries who compete fiercely with one another for top talent. Firms that imposed rigid back-to-the-office requirements found themselves trailing the pack and had to relax it to be competitive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s clear that more work will shift back to offices, but that comes with financial considerations for both the employer and the employee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies and agencies that embrace telework have the opportunity to realize savings by reducing their real estate footprint – fewer square feet to lease, heat and cool. Even before the pandemic, some employers were experimenting with replacing permanent designated offices with workspaces or meeting rooms that employees can reserve for the day, a concept called “office hoteling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, through generous use of remote work, employees also realize savings that take on greater import amid staggering inflation and out-of-control gasoline price hikes. Crunching the numbers helps illustrate how things add up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s likely, at least initially, that dress codes may be a bit more relaxed than pre-pandemic couture. I’m glad my retirement portfolio wasn’t heavily leveraged in companies that make neckties. But you can’t go back to the office and put in eight hours in a bath robe, sandals, baggy gym shorts and a faded Grateful Dead T-shirt. Prices for new men’s suits at Joseph A. Bank this week started at $299. That didn’t include dress shirts or pocket squares.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there’s the drive to the office and back with gas approaching the unfathomable benchmark of five bucks per gallon in Virginia, up 6 percent in the past week and 14 percent since mid-May. If it continues at that pace up to the Independence Day holiday, the average Virginia price per gallon will be nearly $5.50 a gallon by the time state workers return to their offices the next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s use my daily commute from a few years ago as a template. My trip was right at 12 miles each way, or 120 miles a week. With the average mileage of American cars just over 25 miles per gallon in 2019, the latest year for which</span><a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-fuel-efficient-are-cars-sold-united-states/#:~:text=The%20average%20miles%20per%20gallon%20across%20all%20car,in%20the%20fuel%20efficiency%20of%20sedans%20and%20SUVs." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">data are available</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that comes to about 4.7 gallons per week, or about 19 gallons a month. At $5.50 per gallon for regular, that’s just over $103.50 a month for fuel alone, not counting parking costs, wear-and-tear and the value of time and productivity forfeited to driving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, unless you brown-bag it, toss in an extra sawbuck each day for lunch, meaning you’re out another $200 a month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure I’ve missed other costs, but you get the picture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bottom line for a manager – or even the governor – is this: if an employee’s getting the job done telecommuting, why arbitrarily command that he or she fill a seat in a cubicle in a commercial building somewhere? There are ways to determine who excels working from home, who needs the regimented life of the office, and who really should be put on notice. Surely the state does annual, if not quarterly, job reviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the great thing about online work is it gives bosses a rich digital trail of performance metrics on their direct reports, making it impossible to fudge who was logged in and working and when, and what was accomplished. And surely folks deeper on the org chart than a cabinet member or the governor’s chief of staff can parse that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also shows conclusively who’s meeting deadlines – </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who’s missing them.</span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/0604_vm_capitol_tunnel03-1024x683.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/0604_vm_capitol_tunnel03-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/0604_vm_capitol_tunnel03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/0604_vm_capitol_tunnel03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/0604_vm_capitol_tunnel03.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Multiple construction zones surround the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, Va, June 3, 2022. A new tunnel will connect the Capitol with the new General Assembly building. (Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’re digging a big trench through Capitol Square in Richmond where a steel-reinforced concrete tunnel will be constructed as a secure portal for legislators, staffers and the public between the handsome new General Assembly office tower and the Capitol – the temple to democracy designed by Thomas Jefferson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t miss it. Construction fencing shrouds an earthen gash being cut through the heart of the seat-of-government grounds inside which massive machines move tons of soil and sink support pilings deep into the earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it’s completed, likely sometime next year, it will allow the state’s elected legislators to move safely between their offices to the House and Senate chambers and back – a concession, at least in part, to our increasingly angry and violent national ethos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With it, I fear, a cherished part of Capitol Square’s essential character will be forever lost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The roughly 12-acre preserve where the primary institutions of Virginia government are based is its own small town in the middle of a city, and that is one of the reasons I dearly loved going to work there every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who wouldn’t? It’s a remarkable garden in Virginia’s long growing season. Its habitues know each other and enjoy an easy, friendly rapport. When time allows, they stop and chat, sometimes for quite a while on slow days. In the busy season, people go about their business intently, sometimes pitching in to help out where help is needed, but the underlying grace and pleasantness remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors and tourists feel it, too, whether it’s constituents visiting from a far corner of Virginia, a tour bus full of retirees from Missouri listening to guides explain the history that fairly drips from every wall, or Hampton Roads fourth-graders on a field trip. They are struck by the approachability not just of the docents walking them through living history but the amicable air of the staff who make the place tick.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Step just one block away – be it Broad Street to the north or Main Street to the south – and you sense the difference, an increased sort of impersonal, all-business impatience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more than 13 years as I showed up for work in the press filing quarters of the Capitol or, for two years, the Patrick Henry Building which houses the commonwealth’s governor and his cabinet, I marveled at the rare privilege of practicing journalism on-scene there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was back on the Square last week for the first time since before the pandemic for a meeting in the Patrick Henry Building, and it felt like coming home. Everywhere, I ran into old friends – hearty hugs and handshakes, catching up on each other’s lives. I noticed how much some things changed even as so much stayed the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tunnel construction began in December as a massive project to raze and rebuild the legislative office tower known as the General Assembly Building, or “GAB” to regulars, headed down the stretch toward conclusion on the northwestern corner of Capitol Square. The new GAB is expected to open this year, but the tunnel is not due for completion until sometime in 2023.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Schools, welfare and a tunnel: How new Democratic majorities put their mark on their first budget&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/03/12/schools-welfare-and-a-tunnel-how-new-democratic-majorities-put-their-mark-on-their-first-budget/embed/#?secret=H2jrDKcfvl#?secret=UsFMz9KqGC" data-secret="UsFMz9KqGC" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for the $25 million tunnel project, which will allow people passing from the General Assembly building to the Capitol to avoid having to go through another security checkpoint, is clear to anyone who recalls the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent, insurrectionist mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in Washington, intent on subverting the legitimate outcome of a presidential election and hijacking the constitutional process of peacefully transferring power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, one need look no deeper into history than the mass shootings in</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/27/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-timeline/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Uvalde, Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two weeks ago and</span><a href="https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/timeline-related-to-mass-shooting-in-tulsa/article_3a362ef4-e2a5-11ec-b0bb-47b434a89395.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Tulsa, Oklahoma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, last week (at least as of noon Friday) to justify a secure passageway for the elected trustees of the commonwealth’s government. The unreasoning rage that poisons so many in our society, their growing contempt for the rule of law, and the ease with which they obtain modern infantry rifles built to inflict death at industrial scale could put policymakers at risk on a leisurely stroll between their offices and the Capitol, less than the distance from home plate to the deep centerfield wall in a Major League park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those walks have been important. It’s when legislators emerge from their musty offices and conference rooms where they cut deals and speak in the acronym-chocked bureaucratese during winter General Assembly sessions into the fresh air to interact with real people – well-wishers, old friends, voters, lobbyists, journalists, groups demonstrating for or against this or that – as they head to the House and Senate chambers for daily floor sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are times when I’ve made that walk with them, conducting interviews on the way. I’ve seen legislators visibly moved by those groups: revulsion at grisly photos of fetuses shoved in their faces by abortion opponents; gun-rights advocates with intimidating battlefield weapons slung over their shoulders; several hundred women lining both sides of every walkway and the access road that loops around the Capitol, standing silently, shoulder-to-shoulder, in an unforgettable protest to a 2012 bill that would have required an invasive ultrasound procedure of any woman seeking abortion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps most unforgettable: families of those killed and wounded by an enraged student gunman at</span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/us/virginia-tech-shootings-fast-facts/index.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That day, tears spilled, chins quivered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of that can happen in a tunnel. But that’s the country we’ve made for ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a time, as late as the first years of this century, when Virginia’s Capitol threw its doors wide open to all who wanted to visit. Literally. On cool, sunny autumn afternoons, it was not uncommon to see the west, north and east doors propped open to let the fresh, crisp breeze wash through the ground floor. That ended on Sept. 11, 2001. Magnetometers and pat downs became the rule for visitors. Electronically encoded access cards were required for employees, vendors and the press.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tunnels are not new, either. In the late 1930s, a</span><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/2338/2492105501_2b49579893_k.jpg" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sprawling subterranean labyrinth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was built that linked the Executive Mansion, the Capitol, what’s now the Oliver Hill Building, the Patrick Henry Building (then the new State Library), the Medical College of Virginia and the “State Highway Department” before it was known as the Department of Transportation. There could be no connection to the General Assembly Building because it did not exist then. On the site stood</span><a href="https://youtu.be/yOEUZ8Cl6gM" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a theater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where a live country music radio program originated each Saturday night in the 1940s and ‘50s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was debate from 2001 to 2004 about building a tunnel to link the old GAB to the Capitol as plans took shape to rehab and restore the Capitol from its foundation to its roof and add the Extension underneath the South Lawn. Budget hawks of the day prevailed, arguing that it would be an extravagant and elitist perk of power that separated legislators from the people. It didn’t make the cut when ground was broken on the renovation and Extension project that began in the spring of 2005. The tunnel under construction now will open into the upper level of the Extension, which is closed until the project is completed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the work is all done, I hope those in whom Virginia voters invest their trust won’t reflexively abandon their open-air walks – except maybe during snowstorms or the like. I hope they continue to interact with people – be they friends, visitors, lobbyists, even reporters – on those walks. I hope they don’t make the hardened burrow their default choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of all, I pray that no one ever gives them reason to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued his report earlier this month that the status quo in Virginia’s public education has not held its own relative to achievement rankings of other states and that new approaches to schooling are warranted, legislative Democrats peremptorily dismissed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Its conclusions, they insisted before the ink on the report dried, are just another way for the Republican governor to push ahead with alternatives to the state’s legacy system of public education like charter schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is the report a political document? Well, it’s not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> a political document. His team designed it to position the governor’s agenda in its best possible light. It does that in part by tacitly noting ebbing student performance metrics over the terms of two Democratic governors. That’s how political communications work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that doesn’t wholly invalidate it, either. The</span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/statistics_reports/our-commitment-to-virginians.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400"> 34-page report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> draws on data from respected national sources, particularly the last five years since the State Board of Education de-emphasized grade level proficiency in math and reading to enable more schools to meet accreditation requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The report compares results from the commonwealth’s Standards of Learning tests with benchmarks from the National Assessment of Education Progress, which prepares “The Nation’s Report Card.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The governor’s report asserts some sobering findings that, distilled to their essence, show Virginia slipping from the top echelons of states with the most accomplished and highly regarded public schools, but you wouldn’t know it from looking at homegrown school assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For instance, three-fourths of the state’s fourth-grade pupils were rated grade-level proficient in reading in the state’s 2019 SOL tests, yet only 38 percent were shown to read at a fourth-grade level in the NAEP survey, Youngkin’s report says. The document refers to the 37 percentage point difference between the state and national figures for fourth-grade literacy as the “Honesty Gap,” a dig that implies deceit and certainly does nothing to win over Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are discomfiting findings in the report that convincingly withstand protests of partisan authorship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2015, for example, Virginia ranked third nationally in the percentage of high school graduates whose scores on college advanced placement, or AP, tests qualified them for college credit. By last year, Virginia had dropped to ninth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It notes that Virginia parents are voicing their frustrations with public schools by moving their children to private schools or home-schooling them. The pandemic-scarred 2020-21 academic year was especially bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number of home-schooled students in Virginia was 59,638 in the first full year of the pandemic, up from 38,282 in the 2019-20 school year, a 55.7 percent increase. For the school year ending now, with students mostly back in classrooms, the number of home-schooled pupils declined by only 6 percent.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eT7zk45hrk"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/01/03/across-cultural-lines-home-schooling-has-boomed-since-covid-19-hit/">Across cultural lines, home schooling has boomed since COVID-19 hit</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Across cultural lines, home schooling has boomed since COVID-19 hit&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/01/03/across-cultural-lines-home-schooling-has-boomed-since-covid-19-hit/embed/#?secret=qAXHnTpWOC#?secret=eT7zk45hrk" data-secret="eT7zk45hrk" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another 3,748 public school students transferred to in-state private schools for the 2020-21 year, the report said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The report says that the learning loss among children who remained in public schools and attended class remotely for much of the past two years was significant for Virginia pupils, especially children of color. In a</span><a href="https://emilyoster.net/wp-content/uploads/MS_Updated_Revised.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">study of math and English language arts outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 11 states for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Virginia showed the steepest declines of all the states surveyed – 34.1 percentage points in math, and 10.1 percentage points in language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For African American students, the report notes, the toll from the pandemic and online classes was harsh. Forty-five percent of Black third-graders passed their SOL reading assessment for 2021 compared with 61 percent who passed it in 2017. For Hispanic third-graders, that figure fell from 66 percent five years ago to 43 percent last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The state’s teacher advocacy organization, the Virginia Education Association, understandably took umbrage. It accused the administration of deceitfully manipulating the data and belittling teachers. A VEA spokesman said Friday that the organization expects to have a more detailed response ready later this week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last week, Senate Democrats</span><a href="https://www.vasenatedems.com/news/fact-versus-fiction-senate-democrats-lay-out-the-truth-on-public-education-in-virginia" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">released a rebuttal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that convincingly pushes back on the suggestion that they sat idly for years when they had full control of both the General Assembly and governor’s office. There’s an exhaustive menu of Democratic-authored public education legislation offered and enacted the past few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Initially, Democrats called the report “an outright lie,” “a joke,” “tomfoolery” and “dog-whistle talking points.” An </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ad hominem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> harangue by Sen. Louise Lucas accused Youngkin of trying to revive Jim Crow and dismissed his report as an “outright attack from the far right, riling up racist constituencies with lies and deceit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s a lot to unpack, and it goes back to last year’s election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Youngkin’s use of public education as an issue was arguably his decisive tactical maneuver in defeating Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Sure, he used education as something of a Trojan horse packed with conservative culture wars grievances dear to his base. In his campaign, Youngkin thundered against the alleged (and widely disputed) indoctrination of pupils into “</span><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/critical%20race%20theory" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">critical race theory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">” mandatory masking of students in classrooms and reading assignments for books that touched on issues of race and sexuality, saying parents should have veto power in such matters. It resonated among some suburban voters in Northern Virginia and the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas who had assured the Democrats years of primacy in statewide politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Youngkin flustered McAuliffe in the televised final debate of the campaign to the point where the former governor</span><a href="https://youtu.be/nWrpleKHmno" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">blurted out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that parents should have no say in determining what their students are taught, it was a turning point for some affluent, educated commuter moms and dads who select their neighborhoods based on school district rankings. McAuliffe still won the populous suburbs, but his margins were insufficient to withstand record turnouts in GOP-voting rural localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as now, Democrats raised the bloody shirt of bigotry and doubled down on efforts to equate Youngkin to former President Donald Trump whose toxicity in Virginia poisoned one Republican statewide candidate after another from 2016 through 2020. It didn’t work last November. Absent specifics to impeach the governor’s data and the report’s conclusions, it won’t work now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s not to say that Democrats should accede to the governor’s education agenda for the next 3½ years. To the contrary, they have a duty to vet and challenge his education aims and assert better ideas if they have them. Youngkin’s charter schools proposals have already been shot down by a Senate that Democrats will rule at least through next year. But it’s also tone-deaf of Democrats to not acknowledge that the state’s once-sterling public schools have accumulated far more rust than Virginians gladly tolerate and to summarily reject viable analyses from credible national sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Youngkin has already cloaked himself in the mantle of public education to his benefit and the Democrats’ detriment once. His deft political weaponization of it has been elevated by the GOP nationally as a “best practice” for the mid-term congressional and gubernatorial races in numerous states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s going to take more than denial, outrage and invective to checkmate an apprentice politician who is far shrewder than his detractors care to admit.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an appallingly familiar plotline. Only the names and places change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuesday, it was Uvalde, Texas. Ten days earlier, it was Buffalo. Before that it was Boulder, or Sandy Hook, or Orlando, or Columbine. It was Virginia Beach and Virginia Tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes this way: bloody mass murder is carried out by man (isn’t it always?) carrying weapons of war against innocents, usually people he never knew or were no threat to him. Usually, he takes the easy way out and turns the weapon on himself as the police move in. His ignominious remains are anonymously laid in a forgotten coward’s tomb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans sit stunned, breathless,  even crying as they were Tuesday afternoon on my flight as it arrived at O’Hare in Chicago. As the plane taxied toward the gate and passengers toggled their mobile devices off airplane mode after a four-hour flight from Los Angeles, gasps, horrified exclamations and sobs could be heard throughout the cabin as they saw news alerts of the fresh Texas horror that unfolded while we jetted east at nine miles a minute 37,000 feet over the vast Southwestern desert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh God! It’s happened again! Nine children in their school in Texas – I don’t know how you pronounce the name,” cried one woman several rows forward. While most passengers grabbed their bags from overhead bins and rushed for connecting flights, many others remained seated, transfixed by the news. A young woman with an outline of the state of North Carolina tattooed on the inside of her forearm who was seated with her elementary school-aged son and daughter in the row directly in front of me cradled her children to her with one arm as she scanned her screen. Her hand appeared to tremble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News anchors and camera crews parachute into this latest town in hell’s own traveling carnival of gore and, to the utter dismay of every sentient being on earth, thrust cameras and mics into the faces of emotionally shattered relatives and ask them how they feel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the body politic weighs in after it’s had a moment to focus-group its talking points. There are “thoughts and prayers” – always lots and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lots</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of thoughts and prayers – because they require no actual expenditure or measurable commitment to change. Some, mostly Democrats, reflexively voice righteous but empty outrage that the military-grade firearms and high-capacity ammo magazines engineered as anti-personnel military battlefield weapons were so easily obtained and used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others, usually Republicans and their National Rifle Association enablers, extend sympathies to the families and instantly begin dissembling, as Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott did yesterday. The militantly pro-gun all-hat-and-no-cattle governor called for mental health reforms, remarkably not even acknowledging that a truly despicable nihilist on his 18th birthday procured such withering firepower without so much as an eye being batted or a question raised. You got the cash, you get the gun, son. Yee Haw, and Gawd bless Texas!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the days, weeks and months pass. The spray-tan talking heads and their satellite trucks disappear. Families are left alone to the crushing, never-ending sorrow of an eternally empty seat at the dinner table, a closet full of children’s clothes and toys to give away, and a lifetime of nightmares that only worsen when they wake. Then, like the parents of Sandy Hook and Tech, the bright lights return, and they get asked to relive the horror the next time there’s another gun atrocity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">always</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a next time, when the whole nauseating saga replays itself, step by contemptible step. If it were a book or a play, critics would rightly savage it as a failure, a lazy and cliché attempt at modern-day tragedy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States is a<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-25/how-many-guns-in-the-us-buying-spree-bolsters-lead-as-most-armed-country#:~:text=In%20this%20article&amp;text=US%20gun%20owners%20possess%20393.3,now%20of%20about%20330%20million." target="_blank"> nation awash in firearms</a> and lacking the political will to enact commonsense reforms to address it. Efforts to restrict access to the kinds of cutting-edge, rapid-fire, mass-killing instruments that are the weapon of choice in massacres like these fail routinely at both the federal and state level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? Because pro-weaponry absolutists and their organized advocates are a force in Republican politics. So extreme are some of these paranoid bunker dwellers that they contend arsenals up to and including anti-aircraft and tank-busting weaponry are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">guaranteed</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to their private arsenals by the Second Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never mind that such a position is grossly out of step with overall U.S. sentiment.</span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3500861-majority-in-new-poll-favors-stricter-gun-control-measures/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fresh polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Morning Consult and POLITICO shows that 59 percent of Americans surveyed felt it was “very” or “somewhat” important to pass tougher gun laws compared to just 13 percent who felt it was “not too important” or “not important at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But politics today, in both parties, is all about appeasing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the base</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – an apt collective descriptor at several levels. That’s because to win in November, you must first win the nomination in the spring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only the most hard-bitten activists show up for primaries or nominating conventions. From the right, they’re hell-bent on protecting </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">laissez faire,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> open-air gun bazaars and trade marts on one hand while ensuring that government dictates women’s most intimate reproductive autonomy decisions on the other. And because of the way partisan reapportionment works in most states, it’s possible to engineer state legislative or U.S. House districts capable of electing Vladimir Putin if he were the Republican nominee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all boils down to this: Republicans and their fellow travelers have rarely been forced to own their all-out obstruction of even modest restraints on firearms access and the toll it exacts in blood and funerals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few exceptions, including a notable one in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, Republicans ruled the General Assembly and had a fighting chance to hold their lock on legislative power that fall as Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam fought for his political life after a photo of two men – one in blackface and the other in a Klan robe – was found on his medical school yearbook page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It changed when a heavily armed malcontent entered the Virginia Beach Municipal Center and killed a dozen people before police officers put him out of his misery. In one of the best pivots in Virginia politics, Northam and his party shifted the narrative to the fresh carnage. He smartly put GOP gun-lobby acolytes who ruled the Senate and House of Delegates on the record in opposition by calling the General Assembly into a special summer session to consider tightening gun laws. Playing to their base, the Republicans summarily adjourned the session less than an hour after it convened, taking no action. In November, voters gave Democrats majorities in both chambers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the subsequent two years of Democratic rule, the commonwealth passed several gun-control bills. That included restoring a Gov. Doug Wilder-era limit of one handgun purchase per month, universal background checks on gun buyers, a mandatory 48-hour window for owners to report stolen or lost guns, a “red-flag” law giving police the power to temporarily seize guns from people deemed a threat and penalizing people who recklessly leave loaded guns in the reach of a child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One law that eluded the Democrats’ brief season of gun reforms was a ban on the sale of assault-style semiautomatic weapons and high-capacity magazines – exactly the sort of weapon used in this month’s mass murders in Buffalo and Uvalde. After passage in the House of Delegates, four moderate Democratic senators concerned about codifying in law what constitutes an assault rifle and the prospect of criminalizing widely owned weapons sided with Republicans to</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB961" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sink the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all the world, only the United States permits such universal, unfettered and indiscriminate access to firearms and the horrifying scale of death and desolation that results from it. It’s not a problem that’s beyond a solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by 19 foreign terrorists who commandeered jetliners and used them to kill 3,000 innocent Americans in Manhattan, the Pentagon and a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, Congress quickly passed tough and effective legislation that, 21 years on, has prevented a repeat of such an act of war.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet in 2020, there were </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">45,222 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. gun-related deaths. Broken down to an average monthly basis, that exceeded the 9/11 total by 25 percent. Of that total, 97 percent were a form of homicide or the taking of a human life: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">24,292, or 54 percent, by suicide; 19,384, or 43 percent, were murder. The rest were either accidental, involved law-enforcement or were of indeterminate circumstances, according to the </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pew Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Uvalde – and other wholesale executions before it – assures us that until this perpetual cycle of episodic shock and hyperbole followed by official stalling and inaction is disrupted, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">there</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">be a next time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">next time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some of the kids slaughtered by combat weaponry so casually sold to a known monster who left a crimson trail of clues, </span><a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/public-mass-shootings-database-amasses-details-half-century-us-mass-shootings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like so many mass shooters do before they strike</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, could be yours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bill Fitzgerald and I have been friends for years. He’s the evening and night anchor for the newscasts of WTVR-TV in Richmond, the CBS affiliate in Virginia’s capital city. A lot of its coverage is of state and local government and politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A thoughtful, seasoned and soft-spoken journalist not given to rants, Bill was frustrated by the same trend that chafes reporters and editors nationally. Why, he asked, won’t government officials and elected officeholders respond to questions about significant issues confronting Virginians?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He didn’t have to specify what, specifically, he was referring to. I’ve watched him and WTVR end scores of stories about the serious, long-running dysfunctions of the Virginia Employment Commission with the notation that repeated calls requesting answers and interviews from VEC officials got no response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would never overstate the importance of one TV affiliate in one city in Virginia, but it just seems like it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">does not</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400">matter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">,” he said (the emphasis his). “If a newsperson of a legitimate news operation says, week after week, ‘We asked to speak to the person in charge,’ and every week, they said, ‘No, they will not speak to us,’ or they just ignore us, well there was a time when that had an impact.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember those times. I was part of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back in the salad days of legacy journalism, when newspapers considered a 20 percent annual yield on investment as underperforming and owning a network broadcast affiliate in a city the size of Richmond amounted to a license to print money, public officials dismissed an inquiry from a bona fide outlet at their peril. Nothing raised the public’s eyebrows like the notation in a story that someone “ignored repeated requests for comment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How does it affect real people? Well, let’s use the example Bill offered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gov. Glenn Youngkin had vowed as a candidate to clean up the Dumpster fire the VEC had become under former Gov. Ralph Northam – an unresponsive bureaucracy that floundered for more than a year as hundreds of thousands of unemployment claims caused by the coronavirus pandemic accumulated and gathered dust starting in the spring of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bill said he asked Northam face-to-face if the governor would make the former VEC director available to respond to legitimate, longstanding inquiries about thousands of people facing insolvency who spent hours on the phone and emailing the agency in vain, day after day, desperate for answers about their stagnating claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He (Northam) flatly refused,” Fitzgerald said. “They were confident that they could run out the clock.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among his first official acts, Youngkin fired the agency’s former director, Ellen Marie Hess, replaced her with the current director, Carrie Roth, and promised swift results. Sure enough, on Feb. 21, the administration issued a press release crowing that VEC had slashed the number of claims by nearly 90 percent, from 246,273 to just 27,728.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s a phenomenal result! Unbelievable, you might say. So you can imagine the media calls for follow-ups and details about how an agency that couldn’t walk and chew gum at the same time just weeks earlier had dispatched 225,145 claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was a 10-line press release that allowed all the powers-that-be to bloviate a little,” Fitzgerald said. “But the point was they announced this and then refused to talk about it. You cleared 200,000 cases at the VEC in five weeks? What cases were they? Were they first-time claimants? Were they appeals? Were they something else?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They refused, they refused, and they refused – they didn’t want to discuss it. But do the math: five weeks, 200,000-plus cases – 40,000 cases a week? That’s 6,000 cases every day, seven days a week. Did you talk to people? Did you just throw them in a Dumpster? How did that happen?” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now it’s late May. Those questions remain unanswered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Government wasn’t always so unresponsive to the Fourth Estate. I had an advantage covering Virginia policymakers from the 1990s into the 20-teens for The Associated Press. An officeholder or agency could brush off a small town paper or radio station without much consequence. Knowing it was a correspondent whose copy could appear in minutes in newsrooms of all sizes across the state, nation or even the globe — including that small town outlet — had a sobering effect on public officials and institutions and their mouthpieces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lot has changed since then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mainstream news outlets, particularly those supported chiefly by advertising revenue, have seen their fortunes plunge, many to the point of enfeeblement or worse. Staffs have been pruned to the trunk, often starting with the most experienced and accomplished pros with the most perspective and institutional memory, leaving mostly the greenest (and least expensive) staff to find their way without mentors. Resources once devoted to covering government and public policy have been cannibalized to benefit shareholders, and nowhere is that more evident than the Virginia Capitol press corps — numerically a skeleton of itself 20 years ago, but still toiling valiantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some news outlets were dealt to predatory buyers for whom providing thorough news coverage for their communities was never a primary (or secondary, or tertiary … ) interest. Some got snapped up by ideologically driven syndicates that view local outlets as platforms to disseminate, cultivate and advance a political or cultural viewpoint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Market share — determined by audits of paid circulation or, in the case of legacy broadcast media, audience measurement services such as Nielsen — has declined over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Increasingly, public figures, officials and institutions are bypassing traditional or “mainstream” media to micro-target their messages at select audiences via online channels such as social media, email, bloggers and influencers, and allied cable outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It happens to some degree on both poles of the political spectrum, but it’s more prevalent on the right, said University of Mary Washington political science professor Stephen Farnsworth. That was among the findings of research conducted for “The Nightly News Nightmare,” a book Farnsworth co-authored 20 years ago with S. Robert Lichter that examines news media coverage of politics and elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ultimately, a lot of people in politics now see the political environment as a set of silos,” Farnsworth said. “Rather than the traditional idea of trying to grow your base, reaching beyond people who are automatically on your side, today’s politicians increasingly think they only need to talk to the true believers and make sure they turn out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So rather than </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">broadcast </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">the message to the public broadly and risk addressing discomfiting issues they’d sooner sidestep, they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">narrowcast</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> to unquestioning, all-forgiving true believers who’ve already disciplined themselves to reject anything that challenges a favored political figure’s unsupported assertions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Narrowcasting can be very effective in getting to your personal supporters, particularly on the right,” Farnsworth said. Such tactics may benefit a candidate in a nomination fight but later limit a candidate who preaches only to the faithful and excludes those who might be persuadable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Any politician wants to be questioned as little as possible, and the social media environment makes it more possible to say what you want in an unfiltered way. But citizenship depends on context for the facts, and that’s not something you’re likely to get on Twitter or other social media venues. If you’re listening primarily to a media outlet, to the left or the right, that is primarily about promoting an ideological agenda, you might want to look for some other media outlets,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More troubling than the balkanization of the media landscape along cultural and partisan fronts, Farnsworth said, is the willingness of significant segments of the populace to reject evidence even when independent, documentary data that supports the reporting is verifiable and shared publicly. “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/VSrEEDQgFc8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Alternative facts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">” are easier to create and spread under such conditions, unaccountable to honest brokers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, Bill, traditional news media — and those, like you, who do its painstaking and earnest work every day — are disadvantaged to say the least, and probably will be for the foreseeable future. But the real losers, Farnsworth notes, are voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The process depends on informed voters, and if you’re going to freeze out some of the biggest media voices in a community, you’ve made it more difficult for voters to make an informed decision,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1997, Gilmore and his political team came up with the most potent three-word, perfect-for-bumper-stickers campaign mantra I’ve ever seen. “NO CAR TAX.” It was the rocket fuel that propelled him into the Executive Mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It needed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">zero</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explanation, at least not to any vehicle owner who had already paid through the nose to buy the car, maintain it, insure it and fuel it, yet still had to stroke checks for hundreds of dollars — maybe even more for the most bougie of rides – just for the privilege of owning it. The rates varied by locality, but no one in any of the 133 cities or counties that imposed the levy considered it cheap or fair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was universally despised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twenty-five years later, it’s no less loathed – especially as taxpayers open mail from their city or county revenue commissioners’, treasurers’ or finance department offices to see that what they owe on their cars and pickup trucks is anywhere from one-fifth to one-third greater than just a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like everything else, blame COVID-19. The pandemic created profound cutbacks in car manufacturing worldwide, resulting in shortages that have driven sticker prices for new vehicles to extortionate levels and created an unprecedented demand — and insanely inflated valuations — for used cars, valuations on which the new taxes are based.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chesterfield County quickly realized that banking this year’s projected $22 million windfall from the higher vehicle valuations was a nonstarter.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia Beach, the city council has approved applying a 75 percent ratio to personal property tax bills, meaning they will be reduced by one-fourth, offsetting the higher valuations, according to a report by</span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Radio IQ/WVTF</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Richmond suburb of Henrico County has already postponed its payment deadline for the first of two personal property tax installments from June 6 to Aug. 5. The Board of Supervisors intends to take up a separate piece of legislation over the summer that would apply a credit to their second payment that, as Henrico’s finance director, Sheila Minor told WVTF, amounts to “basically giving back that surplus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others are still figuring things out and have made no overtures yet to rein in the car tax bonanza, including Roanoke, the public radio station reported. And to those localities, time’s a-wasting, and the consequences of inaction can be politically crippling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How crippling?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask U.S. Rep. Don Beyer. In 1997, Beyer was the sitting lieutenant governor and the Democratic nominee for governor. At that time, he was the only Democrat holding a top state office chosen by voters statewide, but Democrats still enjoyed hegemony by razor-thin margins in the General Assembly. His race against another top statewide elected officeholder, Gilmore, then the attorney general, was initially expected to be a tight one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“NO CAR TAX” irreversibly changed that. Initially, Beyer battled against the powerful political tide by pointing out — correctly, though in vain — that it was not sustainable fiscal policy. Eventually, however, Beyer attempted something of a “me too,” countering Gilmore’s promise to wipe out the locally imposed tax on the first $20,000 of a vehicle’s value with a $250 state tax credit on household incomes of $75,000 or less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilmore won the election with 56 percent of the vote. A year later, majority General Assembly Democrats grudgingly acceded and Gilmore’s</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title58.1/chapter35/section58.1-3503/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Personal Property Tax Relief Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was passed. “Promises made, promises kept,” Gilmore said in signing his centerpiece policy accomplishment into law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law prescribed a gradual phaseout of the tax, or at least that’s what taxpayers would see. But the way it worked was that rather than end the tax, localities would collect the tax only on vehicle valuations exceeding $20,000 and the state would reimburse those cities and counties for its lost revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, it worked fine when the first-phase reimbursement levels were low during the rip-roaring economic expansion of the 1990s largely fueled by the embryonic and overheated internet technology sector. When the “dot-com bubble” burst and created a recession at the turn of the 21st century, it became the bane of Gilmore’s final year in office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With quarterly general revenue collections for the 2001 and 2002 Virginia fiscal years falling below those from the preceding year and monthly collections trailing budgeted growth estimates 17 out of the 24 months in calendar years 2001 and 2002, Gilmore battled the General Assembly to keep his car tax phaseout on track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skirmish created an internal rift between the governor and allied Republicans in the House of Delegates on one side and, on the other, GOP senators who agreed with Democrats that the full car tax phaseout was fiscally untenable. The feud helped Democrats reclaim the offices of governor and lieutenant governor in the 2001 election. And Gilmore, in his final weeks in office, conceded that the car tax repeal could not advance on schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2004, a tax restructuring bill pushed by Gilmore’s successor, Mark Warner, that permanently capped the car-tax phaseout was approved by a GOP-dominated legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even so, the car tax still provokes civic anger — a grievance that, as Gilmore proved, can translate into a mighty political movement. Decision makers in local governments still on the fence about whether or not to just harvest this year’s car tax windfall or return it to the taxpayers would do well to remember that.</span></p>

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">America’s culture wars were already simmering over everything from COVID masking to school library book bans when POLITICO published the</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/read-justice-alito-initial-abortion-opinion-overturn-roe-v-wade-pdf-00029504" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">leaked draft of a Supreme Court decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would reverse abortion rights protections women have enjoyed for 49 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That turned the burner up from simmer to a furious boil, and for good reason. The decision, if left unaltered from Justice Samuel Alito’s draft majority opinion, would criminalize, with few exceptions, abortions in some states – instantly in at<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/us/state-abortion-trigger-laws-roe-v-wade-overturned/index.html" target="_blank"> least 13 of them</a> with more Republican-ruled states racing to follow suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion rights advocates, who had – or should have had – an inkling that this was coming since three right-wing jurists appointed by President Donald Trump tipped the court’s ideological balance, are outraged. Marches, pickets and vigils sprang up quickly. There were</span><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/05/10/abortion-rights-activists-hold-protest-outside-of-justice-samuel-alitos-home/?msclkid=2796c0c1d15111ec86769b3dd6d32829" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">peaceful demonstrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> near the homes of justices. In Virginia, students in dozens of high schools</span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/virginia-high-school-students-walk-out-in-support-of-abortion-access/3046606/?msclkid=ecfa3a68d15011eca90cbe85546996cc" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">walked out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of classrooms in protest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservatives, evangelicals and MAGA voters who had awaited this moment since the 1970s were euphoric. They hailed the pending evisceration of a privacy right the Supreme Court held as the basis for its 1973 Roe decision. Some states seemed intent on pushing the issue further as </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/louisiana-law-would-ban-abortion-conception-punishable-murder-1704013" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Louisiana advanced legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would define abortion – at any point from conception on – as homicide and subject patients to murder charges. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rage in American society is approaching dangerous levels. And, as Gov. Glenn Youngkin learned this week, the last place you want to be is the desolate terrain between entrenched, warring armies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s measured response to the abortion rights protests outside Alito’s Mount Vernon home ensured that there was sufficient state and local law enforcement to guarantee the safety of Alito and his family. The protest was peaceful, something that could not be assumed in advance given a</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/08/us/madison-anti-abortion-center-vandalized.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Molotov cocktail attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the night before on the office of a Wisconsin anti-abortion group and the arsonists’ chilling graffiti: “If abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/secretly-recorded-video-ignites-abortion-debate-in-virginia-governors-race/2724066/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">staunchly anti-abortion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Republican governor  made sure there was enough security to keep the demonstration orderly and protect both Alito and the First Amendment “right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” A reasonable person couldn’t ask for better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But reason left this discourse long ago.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin attended Virginia&#8217;s fourth March for Life, an annual anti-abortion event held outside the Capitol, on April 27, 2022. (Kate Masters/ Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s actions drew visceral rebukes from the right wing of his own party, upset that he didn’t order an iron-fisted crackdown on the protest, according to a</span><a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/05/10/virginias-gov-glenn-youngkin-hit-by-conservatives-for-failing-to-crackdown-on-scotus/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">report from Salon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some asserted that Youngkin had the authority to arrest protesters</span><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1507" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">under a federal law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the constitutionality of which is debated among legal scholars. His failure to do so, one right-winger tweeted, was tantamount to</span><a href="https://twitter.com/mkolken/status/1523973782112813058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1523973782112813058%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.salon.com%2F2022%2F05%2F10%2Fvirginias-gov-glenn-youngkin-hit-by-conservatives-for-failing-to-crackdown-on-scotus%2F" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">abetting terrorism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, it brought the politically ambitious governor to heel. On Wednesday, Youngkin and fellow Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, who run states many justices call home, sent </span><a href="https://twitter.com/GovLarryHogan/status/1524494786031280128?s=20&amp;t=nNAD7puS4DKgEC7RlU9gzw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a joint letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Attorney General Merrick Garland asking that the Justice Department secure the justices’ houses and enforce the federal statute. Youngkin later took a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/GovernorVA/status/1524526177246924801?s=20&amp;t=S9cVZlODLL7heh-0qWDqBw" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly harsher tone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Fox News interview and then tweeted it for good measure afterward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things are no gentler on the other side where urging restraint can get you burnt, especially if suggested by someone without a uterus. Bearing a long legacy of lower pay and less advancement for the same work as men, workplace harassment and worse, the impending loss of their reproductive autonomy has left women in no mood to hear from men how they should channel their anger. It matters not that they’re friendly admonitions against actions that allow adversaries – reeling since the leaked opinion was published – to invert the political narrative and gain a tactical advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the aftermath of a Minneapolis cop’s broad-daylight curbside murder of George Floyd two years ago. The</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">righteous railing against intolerable racial injustice was subverted by calls from the far left to “defund the police.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans amplified and leveraged “defund” to stain all Democrats, including the vast majority of those who rejected the idea, crippling what appeared to be a 2020 “blue tsunami” poised to expand the party’s sizeable U.S. House majority and deliver a filibusterproof Senate majority. The result was a spare Democratic House majority and a 50-50 Senate split that effectively allows GOP-friendly West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin to single-handedly doom most any bill he wants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Defund” still haunted Virginia Democrats last fall as it</span><a href="https://youtu.be/XW-91ocurlI" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">helped the GOP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> win its first statewide election in a dozen years, giving Republicans the governor’s, lieutenant governor’s and attorney general’s offices plus the House of Delegates. Thus, the future of abortion rights in Virginia, at least through 2023, resides with one abortion-averse male Democrat, state Sen.</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/05/09/draft-supreme-court-ruling-makes-morrissey-the-wild-card-in-deciding-the-future-of-abortion-in-va/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Morrissey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, if Alito’s draft becomes final and restrictive legislation reaches the Senate floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rage is easy. It feels good in the moment. But in the real world, rash actions taken in anger cause electoral harm. And </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">elections matter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The right-wing court that is about to overturn Roe and end a half-century of legal protection for abortion rights is a direct consequence of the 2016 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Youngkin, you did the right thing before realizing you’d riled your party base and did a humbling walkback. But by allowing the peaceful demonstration to proceed, it was a one-day story, not another historic horror show of Virginia cops in riot gear busting heads on a public street as teargas suffuses a bucolic neighborhood. We can only hope your judgment is as sound if there’s a next time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both sides in this struggle should remember that anger is a beneficial companion until it slips its leash.</span></p>

Joe Morrissey, D-Richmond. (Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A draft U.S. Supreme Court opinion that, as published by POLITICO a week ago, would end a federal guarantee of abortion rights granted under the 1973 &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Roe v. Wade</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> decision.&#8221; If the final opinion in a case challenging a strict Mississippi anti-abortion law is anything like the leaked draft, abortion rights will become a state-by-state crazy quilt of differing laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Virginia, that puts Democratic state Sen. Joe Morrissey squarely in the middle, whether he wants to be or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So-called red, or Republican-ruled, states are poised to rapidly –</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/parenting/2022/05/06/support-in-states-banning-abortion/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">in 13 states, instantly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> – ban or drastically limit abortions if the Supreme Court reverses </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400">Roe</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400">. Think of the South along with a scattering of Midwest and Rocky Mountain states forcing wholesale overnight closures of women’s clinics within them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blue, or Democratic-ruled, states (think California and the Northeast) would remain open for women who decide to terminate unwanted pregnancies, and women from the red states could go to blue ones in a post-</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Roe</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The battlegrounds will be states such as Virginia where neither party holds the balance of power outright. And in the commonwealth, no political figure is more pivotal to determining the future of abortion rights than Morrissey, a trouble magnet whose career arc has repeatedly defied political physics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Morrissey is a Democrat in the 40-seat Virginia Senate where his party holds the slimmest possible majority – 21 to 19. Lose just one Democrat on a party-line floor vote and Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle Sears casts the deciding vote to break the 20-20 tie. Sears makes no secret of her disdain for </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Roe</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Such a scenario gives Republicans a clear path to curb or ban abortion because Republicans control the House of Delegates and the governor’s office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fightin’ Joe,” as he bills himself (his history literally backs him up; more on that later), is hard to pigeonhole, either by the GOP or his own party. On some issues, he’s progressive. In the legislative session that ended in March, he led the fight to end mandatory minimum sentencing on most felonies, arguing that draconian punishments enacted in the get-tough-on-crime era of the 1980s and ’90s disproportionately harmed people of color by taking away a judge’s discretion to lessen sentences for first-time offenders or those convicted of crimes with significant mitigating circumstances. Two Democrats joined a united GOP caucus to defeat his bill on the Senate floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Morrissey, a former Richmond commonwealth’s attorney,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">has been at the heart of numerous landmark criminal justice reforms enacted since 2019 when Democrats began a two-year period in which they controlled both the Legislature and the governor’s office, including the repeal of the death penalty in Virginia, where more inmates had been executed than any state except Texas since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976. Virginia is the only state in the South to have done so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But on the issue of abortion, Morrissey, a Roman Catholic, finds himself more aligned with Republicans. He has said he would consider limits on abortions, perhaps after 20 weeks – about five months. That aligns with what Gov. Glenn Youngkin has proposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am a moderate who tries to bring consensus to this,” he said in an interview with me last week. “While I’m personally opposed to abortion, I believe the woman’s decision should be made after consulting with her doctor, her partner and perhaps her spiritual adviser. I don’t think women should be jailed for having an abortion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There has to be some type of middle ground. Perhaps it’s if the child can feel pain. But I believe my moderate position is the view of the people of my district as well as … Virginia and that’s how I’m going to approach this,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, Morrissey’s position was boilerplate in the party not so long ago. Rather than a fulsome, unlimited embrace of abortion rights, Democratic candidates took a measured approach in the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century. Theirs was a carefully calibrated message succinctly articulated by Bill Clinton in his successful 1992 presidential campaign: “Abortions should be safe, legal and rare.” Back-to-back Democratic governors Mark Warner and Tim Kaine backed “a woman’s right to choose,” but were careful not to mire themselves in such issues as whether late-term procedures should be allowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since then, as polls have shown support for legal abortion and sustaining </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Roe</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and as the party’s progressive wing has gained clout, many Democrats have been more and more willing to push the envelope. Some now bristle at any suggestion that abortions should be rare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It came to a head in Virginia in 2019 over</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2491&amp;ses=191&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2491" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that would have relaxed abortion restrictions to allow the procedure</span><a href="https://youtu.be/ZeYamfLZqdE" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">as late as labor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, provided that just one doctor certified that delivering the child would affect the mother’s health, not the concurrence of three doctors that delivery could kill  the mother or severely damage her health.  The bill died quickly in committee in a General Assembly then under GOP control, but Republicans – including then-President Donald Trump – had a field day, labeling it “infanticide.” Then-Gov. Ralph Northam, a pediatric neurologist who has since returned to his medical practice, aggravated the PR maelstrom when he appeared to</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-ralph-northam-legislation-va-state-wire-womens-health-7f30ea0a5f1045aa82c130c9dece1ab8" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">defend the legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in</span><a href="https://youtu.be/SkTopSKo1xs" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">on live radio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that can most charitably be described as clumsy and tone-deaf. His Dumpster-fire interview was overshadowed just days later when a photo of a person in blackface and another in Klan regalia was discovered on Northam’s medical school yearbook page.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Morrissey’s position on abortion and the leaked draft Supreme Court decision is already an intraparty flashpoint. Lashrecse Aird, a Democratic former delegate who is challenging Morrissey in the 2023 primary, takes a significantly more expansive position on abortion than Morrissey. Aird quickly used the POLITICO disclosure to rouse abortion-rights voters by saying the ability of women in Virginia to make their own reproductive decisions hinges on Morrissey’s ouster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is the only vote that is required to undo the progress that has been made,” Aird said in</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/05/03/youngkin-denounces-supreme-court-leak-as-roe-case-casts-uncertainty-over-abortion-in-virginia/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">an interview with the Virginia Mercury</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It could be a very persuasive argument for Aird. Primary voters aren’t known for moderation in either party. Her statement, however, omits the significant fact that Morrissey does not sit on the</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+com+S4&amp;221+com+S4" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Senate Education and Health Committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> where GOP abortion bills go to die before they reach a vote by Morrissey and the full Senate. It happened in March when Republican Del. Karen Greenhalgh’s informed-consent abortion bill, which had passed the House of Delegates on a 52-48 vote, died on a 10-5 Senate committee vote, ensuring that it never made it to the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But you get Aird’s drift. And it could be a potent issue for her because primary voters are not known for moderation. Besides, whether Morrissey remains in the Senate could be moot to the issue of abortion if the GOP achieves an outright Senate majority or even a 20-20 tie in legislative elections still a year and a half away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Publicly, Morrissey is projecting an almost</span><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/bd/f5/bb/bdf5bb2ca36e3a4a49ff2ec3e4181e6c.jpg" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Alfred E. Neuman-</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">esque</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> “What – me worry?”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> air about the challenge. But, as even a short interview reveals, Aird clearly has his attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t win in politics if you’re on the extreme. Lashrecse Aird is on the extreme,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, you don’t normally win in politics or serve in elective office if you’re doing time for allegedly having sex with an underage employee less than one-third your age. In 2015, when Morrissey was in the House, he was</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/us/virginia-joseph-morrissey-set-to-serve-in-jail-as-well-as-house.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">commuting daily to the Capitol from jail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> where he served a six-month sentence for a misdemeanor, contributing to the delinquency of a minor. He and his </span><span style="font-weight: 400">onetime</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> law office secretary have married and have four children ranging in age from 4 to 9 years old. Northam pardoned Morrissey earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Morrissey has also been jailed for <a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/central-virginia/from-the-archive-morrissey-baugh-get-5-day-sentences-they-apologize-but-only-to-judge/article_04f32f64-1c48-5e61-9d51-8a031ce8d0ea.html#tracking-source=in-article" target="_blank">resorting to fisticuffs</a> in a courthouse, lending credence to his pugilistic brand. Currently disbarred for a second time, he is fighting to get his law license restored. And all of that was known to voters when he easily won his Richmond-area Senate district seat three years ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Politically, he’s outlived premature obituaries and enjoyed more lives than a cat. At age 64, he wouldn’t know what to do with himself without the hot breath of adversity on his neck. Now, thanks to a Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority and the likely demise of abortion rights, Fightin’ Joe may be in for the fight of his life.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lord in heaven, I know I swore many years ago that I’d do all in my power to avoid getting pulled into a rabbit hole by Paul Goldman, so please don’t strike me dead for this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But here goes: Paul is right in suing to force House of Delegates elections this fall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a long career as a lawyer and Democratic strategist, Paul has been known to approach members of the press from time to time pitching ideas that sometimes felt off-topic, even a bit crackpot, or at least not something worth pursuing in the near term – and by “near term,” I mean </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ever</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paul is a student of history and the constitutions – those of both the United States and Virginia – and his perspectives were, and are, moored in them, both in how they form the superstructure of the national and state governments as well as the rights they safeguard at a level far beyond that of statutory law. Correct though he may have been, his entreaties to correspondents hung on a question of newsworthiness (or at least the media’s arbitrary interpretation of it at the time).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as now, Paul seemed – at least to us ink-stained wretches of the Capitol Square press corps following the daily, incremental intrigues of politics and legislation – to be somewhat unbound by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">realpolitik</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> considerations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Caller ID became a thing, it was not uncommon to let Paul’s calls roll over to voicemail during a busy day. A dialogue with Paul over a pet issue I was disinclined to cover could chew up quite a swatch of time as precious as oxygen to a reporter pushing a copy deadline. I’m not proud of doing it, but it was easier than explaining to an unhappy Associated Press desk editor why my story, which we had promised to newspaper and broadcast newsrooms by a certain time, was now overdue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even when Paul came at us with ideas out of left field – occasionally, wide of the foul pole – there was still undeniably an argument rooted in the law, the Constitution, administrative and legislative norms, or all of the aforementioned. I and other writers dismissed Paul at our own peril.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So it seems like a heaping helping of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">déjà vu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> that Paul is the author of and plaintiff in a lawsuit that would force a second election in as many years for all 100 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. It would coincide with this year’s election for all 11 of Virginia’s seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. And, if the court rules in Goldman’s favor, that would create no small amount of electoral confusion in a state where voters are accustomed to having their federal elections on even-numbered years, such as this, and elections for state offices on odd-numbered years, as last year’s races for delegates’ seats plus governor and two other statewide offices were.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A ruling on Goldman’s federal lawsuit is expected soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Virginia Mercury’s Graham Moomaw</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/29/virginia-explained-the-lawsuit-trying-to-force-new-house-elections/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=525dfcb7-3424-4611-bd56-72b526552827" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">unpacked the lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, its genesis and the potential consequences in a laudable work of explanatory journalism on Friday. The “Cliff’s Notes” version of it: Virginia didn’t meet its constitutional obligation to redraw its state legislative districts in time for last year’s House of Delegates election chiefly because of the pandemic. The U.S. Constitution directs the government to conduct a census every 10 years, and the onset of the coronavirus and COVID-19 (now the cause of just shy of 1 million U.S. deaths) derailed the 2020 census just as it got rolling. The contagion sent the world into a tailspin that will take years yet to overcome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Virginia Constitution requires that the commonwealth’s congressional and legislative districts be reapportioned the year after each census – essentially, every year that ends in the numeral “1” – to equalize the population of each district. That’s to ensure the constitutional “one-person, one vote” principle, ensuring that each ballot cast carries statistically the same weight, and that is the indispensable premise on which Goldman bases his litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in more functional, non-pandemic times, redistricting in Virginia was a frenetic, fast turnaround. To have any hope of meeting the state’s electoral timetables for filling delegates’ seats in that odd-numbered reapportionment year, the granular Census Bureau data required to draft new, equally apportioned district boundaries should be in the state’s hands by April. Last year, that didn’t happen until August.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only was that extraordinarily late to have any hope of resetting lines in time for a November election, the new, bipartisan Redistricting Commission that voters added to the state Constitution by passing a referendum on their 2020 ballot turned out to be anything but functional.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The commission, created to eliminate the naked partisanship that dominated reapportionment when the General Assembly alone handled it, dissolved in partisan discord last autumn, utterly failed at its only task, and punted it to the Virginia Supreme Court which finished its work three days after Christmas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last November’s elections were held in old districts that had grown hopelessly out of kilter since they were drawn in 2011. Some districts grossly exceeded what should have been an average population of 86,313 based on the 2020 census in Virginia; others, particularly in rural areas, fell woefully short of it. So fast-growing suburban areas got shortchanged on proportional representation while rural districts, where disheartening population drains continue, were disproportionately over-represented.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why Paul is right and, despite the state’s pearl-clutching over holding what would amount to three House of Delegates elections in three consecutive years – last year, this year and 2023 – is a huge pain, the court should rule in his favor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A constitutional, democratically elected republic – a government of, by and for the people – is sometimes messy. It can be inconvenient and confusing. It demands a level of civic awareness and participatory buy-in from an increasingly jaded and fatigued public. It requires an environment of robust, free speech and debate over ideas, even if it breeds vehement disagreements, but a shared willingness to settle our differences at the ballot box rather than the seditious violence that mercifully failed six days into 2021. But that willingness must rest on the foundational certainty that every vote counts and all votes are equal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words we put into our constitutions aren’t recommendations or guidelines to be followed when it’s convenient. They guarantee our liberty and form the guardrails in which we practice self-governance – a belief each generation for nearly 250 years has upheld, shedding blood and sacrificing lives to preserve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paul is correct in asserting that people have every right to believe that votes Virginians cast in Scott or Northumberland counties matter just as much as votes cast in Alexandria or Virginia Beach. And if that necessitates a little extra diligence by voters and time and expense by candidates, then – as the people of Ukraine will attest – that’s a miniscule price to pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Paul, if you’re reading this, sorry about the unanswered calls.</span></p>

(Photo courtesy of DBHDS)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been decades — at least three of them — with a continuous litany of embarrassments, mismanagement, tragedy and even death that have dogged Virginia’s dysfunctional system of mental health services and hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the drumbeat continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little over a week ago, two felons broke out of the Eastern State Hospital in Williamsburg where a court had placed them. One was captured the same day. The other remained on the loose, reportedly armed and dangerous, for several days before being apprehended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The escapes last week were the second time in 12 months patients escaped Eastern State, established in 1773 as one of America’s first mental hospitals. In March, a patient at Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie escaped from that facility for the second time in three years and</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/zachery-oakey-escapes-central-state-hospital-twice-in-3-years" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">drove a big rig to Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> before he was caught. A patient with a history of violence</span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/news/local-news/richard-garrett-update" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">broke free</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Dinwiddie hospital last November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does that rattle any cages on Capitol Square?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has lurched along for at least 32 years, in fits and starts, trying to address well-chronicled, often grim, sometimes even infamous failings in its system for helping those with mental and behavioral health and substance abuse needs. And just when there’s progress, politics interferes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin has</span><a href="https://www.wavy.com/news/virginia/virginia-to-review-security-of-state-mental-facilities-after-escapes-from-psychiatric-hospital/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered a security review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the state’s mental hospitals after the Easter weekend Eastern State escapes. As he should. But it’s probably not his last headache over the state’s mental health system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the public policy quicksand in which previous governors have found themselves in recent decades. Felons busting out of state hospitals seems trifling in comparison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting in 1990, the Justice Department began a multi-year investigation of Virginia’s mental hospitals for what it described as patient care so inadequate that it created dangerous and even life-threatening conditions. In the latter part of that decade, my friend and Associated Press colleague Bill Baskervill embarked on groundbreaking reporting that documented ghastly, almost medieval practices at understaffed, poorly managed and poorly overseen state hospitals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baskervill, long since retired, worked in AP’s Richmond bureau and won national accolades for his dogged investigative reporting into horrifying treatment of patients at state-run mental hospitals. Among his findings were accounts of patients who lay on their backs, bound hand and foot with heavy leather restraints for days on end; of a</span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-jul-13-mn-12216-story.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">woman who died</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in such conditions after her complaints and warnings from family members that she was dying went unheeded; of allegations by the father of a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">19-year-old</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who said his son was so savagely sodomized by staff at one hospital with an object similar to a broom handle that it tore his bowel, punctured his liver, sending him into a coma and, 14 months later, his death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill’s work, along with that of Michael Martz, who still does strong accountability journalism at the Richmond Times-Dispatch, brought about a suite of cover-your-ass state government responses that subsequently became the standard after-action playbook. Reviews get launched. A few heads might roll. Some money is sprayed at the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Bill’s stories hit, a state mental health commissioner resigned and the director of one of the hospitals was transferred. Policies severely limiting the profligate use of full-body restraints were enacted. Lawsuits were settled. Millions were appropriated in the name of fixing problems the news reports disclosed and, notably, triaging the resulting reputational injuries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years later, a Virginia Tech student whose violent delusions were so disturbing that they triggered dire warnings from university faculty slipped through the state’s sieve-like mental health infrastructure. He legally bought two handguns he used to carry out the deadliest campus massacre in U.S. history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Tim Kaine empaneled a blue-ribbon commission led by former U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge and retired Virginia State Police Superintendent Gerald Massengill, and it produced a scathing report on system’s incompetencies at identifying, treating and tracking those in mental crises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laws intended to tighten the safety net were enacted, particularly those that required people judged to be dangerous to themselves and others be added to a registry of people who can’t buy firearms. And, of course, more money — $42 million, to be exact – was added to shore up the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The monetary commitment was disrupted by the great recession of the late 2000s which ate deeply into Virginia’s tax revenues and resulted in years of spartan budgeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It only took six years for Virginia’s next heartbreaking mental health services failure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2013, state Sen. R. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, was nearly killed in a</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/state-mental-hospital-in-staunton-had-room-for-deedss-son-on-monday/2013/11/20/5faeccaa-51fd-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html?wpisrc=al_lclpolitics" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">knife attack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by his son Gus who was in the throes of a mental health crisis. Gus, only 24, fatally shot himself after repeatedly stabbing his father at their Bath County home. Four years earlier, he had traveled the state campaigning with his dad, the 2009 Democratic nominee for governor, in an unsuccessful campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The day before the attack, a magistrate had issued an order for Gus to undergo an emergency psychiatric evaluation. Doctors who examined him at the Rockbridge Area Community Services agreed that he should be hospitalized, but officials said they were unable to locate a psychiatric unit bed for him in just the six hours that the magistrate’s order allowed him to be detained without his consent.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_15774" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deeds-petersen-surrovell-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-15774 size-full" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deeds-petersen-surrovell-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deeds-petersen-surrovell-1.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deeds-petersen-surrovell-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deeds-petersen-surrovell-1-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deeds-petersen-surrovell-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deeds-petersen-surrovell-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deeds-petersen-surrovell-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deeds-petersen-surrovell-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/deeds-petersen-surrovell-1-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Bath, right, speaks on the Senate floor in 2020. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as now, the governor, Bob McDonnell, responded by ordering a top-level review of Virginia’s mental health services, hell-bent to find out what happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it sounds cyclical and repetitive to you, imagine how it feels to Deeds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still a member of the state Senate, his family’s tragedy has rendered him by far the commonwealth’s most tireless and credible advocate for bringing respectability to what has been a hot mess of a mental and behavioral health treatment system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I started doing this work eight years ago or so, I thought it was just a matter of moving a few deck chairs around … and adding a few bucks to the formula and you could fix mental health,” Deeds, 64, said in an interview last week. “What I’ve come to realize is that we were so far behind the eight ball and so maladjusted in the way we spend our money. We spend way too much on hospitals and we don’t spend enough on community services.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deeds pushes for the sort of reforms and funding that the nation’s 12th-largest state should have, and just when he enjoys a measure of success, it gets whittled away, sometimes by a difficult budget or, as is the case today, a governor and Republican-led House of Delegates committed to putting the money into tax relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a problem before the pandemic and the pandemic turned it into a crisis. We were overwhelmed,” Deeds said. Now, as the budget-writing committees of the Republican House and the Democratic Senate try to reconcile differing views of what to do with a $2.6 billion surplus, the time has come to regain momentum the commonwealth lost toward demanding better from its mental health system and providing the money necessary to accomplish it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to figure out how we can work together on a bipartisan basis in this budget environment,” he said. “We have an opportunity to do some things like complete the buildout of</span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/developmental-services/step-va/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">STEP Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Deeds said. The program, inaugurated during the administration of former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, would streamline and expedite services for those in need of services – as his son was – throughout the system starting at the community level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the roadmap for the Department of Behavioral Health and Disability Services to continue putting a dismal past behind it, as it was doing before the pandemic’s interruptions. It’s a cause in which Deeds has invested his time, his work, his passion and, literally, his blood. It’s a modern formula, based on proven best practices, that can empower comprehensive improvement if funded, sustained and given a chance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s got to be more fruitful than the old CYA playbook of heads rolling, ordering voluminous reviews that gather dust, and dispensing unaccountable millions of dollars to manage the visible symptoms without addressing the underlying malady.</span></p>

(Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last place where the free expression of ideas and robust debate about them should be inhibited is a college campus. And the last institution that should call for such a thing, particularly at a university founded by one of the nation’s earliest champions of unfettered speech, is a newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s what happened at the University of Virginia recently ahead of a speech there last week by former Vice President Mike Pence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper, The Cavalier Daily, asserted in a</span><a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2022/03/editorial-dangerous-rhetoric-is-not-entitled-to-a-platform" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">March 17 editorial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Pence, a Republican who was former President Donald Trump’s understudy, was not entitled to a platform at UVa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its editorial board went far beyond disagreeing with or even impeaching Pence’s politics. It made the unsupported assertion that Pence’s words were tantamount to “violence” and an “impermissible” threat to the “wellbeing and safety of students.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The editorial would be defensible if there were an actual risk of violence. (It’s worthy of note, however, that the university’s founder, Thomas Jefferson, said that the “tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pence’s brand of conservative politics alienates a lot of people, including me for the most part. However, it’s an untenable leap to equate it with violent hate speech. Yet the student editorialists attempted that, poisoning their argument by hyperbolically likening Pence’s UVa appearance to the brutality of neo-Nazi thugs who left serious injuries and death in the wake of their Charlottesville riot in August of 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…(W)e must seriously consider the environment we wish to tolerate,” the editorial read, implying that only those deemed morally or politically appropriate would have a forum at UVa for their speech. And who becomes the arbiter? The newspaper’s ed board? A student tribunal representing a favored political orthodoxy? A Star Chamber of faculty or administration illuminati?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On American college campuses, support for censoring speech is not widely shared, according to</span><a href="https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KFX_College_2022.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a nationwide poll of college students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted last summer by Ipsos for the Knight Foundation. It shows that only 22 percent support restricting speech they consider “offensive or biased.” Just one in four felt it was permissible to disinvite speakers because the message would offend certain groups of people. Where students overwhelmingly draw the line is hate speech with just over two-thirds favoring a ban on racial slurs on campus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UVa and American free speech have a common ancestor in Jefferson. For all his manifold historical failings, the third president understood that no society can be free without a right of unfettered expression that encompasses speech, religion, the press and the right of the governed to petition power for change. His fingerprints are all over the First Amendment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I am no Pence fan, I unequivocally defend his right to lawfully voice his ideas at UVa or any other venue. The same freedom allows me to write – and you to read – these words. I assert the same full-throated defense of the Cavalier Daily’s right to publish its March 17 editorial, because poorly reasoned speech enjoys no less protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, wiser heads at UVa with a greater knowledge of and appreciation for the Bill of Rights dismissed the editorial for the folly that it was. In a</span><a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2022/04/letter-to-the-editor-free-speech-is-a-fundamental-u-va-value?ct=content_open&amp;cv=cbox_featured" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">letter to the editor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published a week before Pence’s speech, 17 faculty members representing a wide range of academic disciplines dismantled the editorial and the troubling view of foundational liberties it reflects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It laid bare the editorial’s “assumption that the editors should enjoy the freedom to say what they want but others with whom they disagree should not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The faculty and administration response at UVa is refreshing. Not every university so resolutely safeguards academic freedom and the uninhibited exchange of ideas. University of Chicago climate science researcher Dorian Abbot</span><a href="https://www.thefire.org/the-threat-of-campus-orthodoxy-has-been-looming-dorian-abbots-mit-disinvitation-suggests-its-arrived/?msclkid=5d8bd456bd7f11ecb26b25470fd9c305" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was disinvited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from delivering a lecture last fall at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology because of questions he raised about diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lost in the editorial’s call to de-platform Pence at UVa is this important observation made by Mo Elleithee, the founding director of the Institute of Politics and Public Service at Georgetown University: It’s not just the speaker who would be denied a forum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sometimes we get criticized,” said Elleithee, whose program at Georgetown is respected nationally and by Washington’s most influential names for evenhandedly exposing its students to perspectives from across the political spectrum. “Students will say, ‘How can you give a platform to so-and-so?’ I respond that I’m not just giving them a platform, I’m also giving you a platform. Any speaker we have has to agree to take students’ questions, and I give students the right to ask whatever they want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first met Mo 22 years ago, he was doing PR for Sen. Chuck Robb’s unsuccessful re-election campaign. Even when he was on the front lines of partisan clashes, Mo had a genuine regard and respect for his professional adversaries. When he became communications director for the Democratic National Committee, Mo had lunch monthly with his counterpart at the Republican National Committee, Sean Spicer, later Trump’s first White House press secretary. In those lunches, he said, he and Spicer would discuss anything </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> politics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s where I learned we have kids about the same age, that wore the (military) uniform, and how important his faith is to him,” Elleithee said. So after he returned to his alma mater and established the Institute, he invited Spicer to speak there. He said he got angry emails from some alumni and donors. The campus paper denounced Spicer’s visit but, rather than demand its cancellation, urged a boycott. Yet it drew a standing-room-only crowd and people had to be turned away. The audience included Trump supporters and detractors, Elleithee said, and both got to question Spicer directly. He may never know if any minds were changed that day, but those who were there were pleased to have had the access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what college is, or at least should be: a place where kids grow into adults and, maybe for the first time, are free to ask their own questions, reach their own conclusions and form their own views — to think for themselves. They should have the widest possible exposure to differing ideas and arguments and a supportive environment to examine their consciences and make their own choices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Stephen Farnsworth is no stranger to controversial speakers. He recalls an appearance he moderated several years ago with former President George W. Bush’s top political adviser, Karl Rove. While it generated a peaceful protest outside the venue, the event wasn’t disrupted, and Rove was not heckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As the left and the right are engaged in trying to silence each other, everybody’s worse off,” said Farnsworth, a political science professor at UMW and director of its Center for Leadership and Media Studies. “This isn’t limited to college students. College students are in many ways mirroring what they see in the larger political discourse of this country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly, he said, students see the food fights that pass for informed debate on cable networks such as Fox and MSNBC “and think it’s a model for how they should behave themselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open forums such as those on college campuses are healthy, he said, because they afford the speaker the chance to be heard and the audience the chance to question, dissect and challenge the speaker’s assertions in real time in a setting that values open, informed inquiry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s sort of hard to move beyond the basic idea that the cure for false speech is more speech,” Farnsworth said.</span></p>

Ralph Northam's "homespun, hands-off and unhurried persona didn’t serve him well" during times when Virginians wanted to see their governor taking charge, says columnist Bob Lewis. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The knock on former Gov. Ralph Northam was that he tended not to address problems until they bit him in his derriere, and even then only after considerable embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, three months after Dr. Northam resumed his pediatric neurology practice, an</span><a href="https://www.virginiadot.org/After_Action/Jan_2022_Winter_Weather_AAR_March_31_POST_EXECUTIVE_REVIEW_FINAL_acc040422.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">independent after-action assessment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that a combination of problems left him poorly informed about a snowstorm that caused 833 accidents and stranded 819 vehicles across Virginia, much of it on Interstate 95, for more than 24 hours in subfreezing temperatures three days into 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, according to the report, freakish weather extremes that turned remarkably hostile with almost no warning compounded by technical and communications failures at the operational level plus human limitations created a largely undeserved public relations debacle in the governor’s final days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governors don’t have a button in their offices that can shoo away bad weather or other disasters. Nor do they have lights and sirens that alert them in advance of unforeseeable catastrophes, allowing them to brace for what the late Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld once called “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/REWeBzGuzCc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unknown unknowns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But they respond in different ways. Mark Warner, for example, seemed perpetually overcaffeinated and held his staff to account for knowing about not just predictable threats but conditions or trends that could potentially lead to one. The idea that he would be seen as being behind the curve haunted him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other governors also tended to lean into “over preparedness” at times. Days after Gov. Bob McDonnell was inaugurated in January of 2010 as what was forecast to be a major blizzard descended on Virginia, I encamped with his staff to report firsthand on the commonwealth’s response from the top echelon of power. The storm turned out to be a dud, closing a bunch of schools for a day or two at worst, but the National Guard was on alert and all available staff from the State Police, the Department of Emergency Management and the Department of Transportation were at battle stations ahead of the storm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Northam, the circumstances were almost inverse. What was predicted as a pedestrian weather event coming hard on the heels of near-record warm New Year’s Day temperatures caught everyone by surprise almost up to the point that it turned massively destructive over a 50-mile swath of Virginia between Washington, D.C., and Richmond. Given the benign forecast, Northam didn’t preemptively declare an emergency. By the time the full gravity of the situation became clear from fragmentary reports of overworked, desperate police and transportation crews in the field, it was too late for Northam to do much except try and mitigate suffering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam was pilloried for not activating the Virginia National Guard with hundreds of people trapped in their vehicles overnight for more than 40 miles with overnight lows in the low- to mid-teens. Remarkably, no deaths or serious injuries were attributed to the jam. But, as the report’s timeline notes, the crisis was nearly a day old before the state’s top leadership realized its full enormity. By then, there was little to nothing the Guard could do given the approximately 24 hours it takes citizen soldiers to muster and deploy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As National Guard spokesman Cotton Puryear</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/08/how-virginia-officials-hope-to-avoid-a-repeat-of-the-snowy-shutdown-of-i-95/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">told the Mercury’s Graham Moomaw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week, the Guard has limited quick reaction capabilities without advance staging requests from localities or the governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Reading the report, there’s nothing that sticks out to me as a smoking gun,” said Bill Leighty, who as chief of staff to former governors Warner and Tim Kaine ably quarterbacked responses to some of the state’s worst crises. That included Hurricane Isabel in 2003, the sniper attacks of 2002 and the Virginia Tech shooting of 2007. “Just a calamity of a bunch of events happening at the same time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the report chronicles, it was Murphy’s Law – whatever </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">can</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> go wrong </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – on steroids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the weather turned cold, unstinting rains made it impossible to pre-treat pavement to inhibit snow and ice. Traffic volumes were about 65 percent heavier than average on the East Coast’s busiest traffic artery because of people returning from holiday trips and flights canceled because of COVID-19 and weather. Trees bent, broke and toppled under the weight of the wet, fast-falling snow and high winds, making alternate routes impassable and leaving half a million Dominion Energy customers without electricity. Power outages also took cellular towers offline and disabled VDOT traffic cameras, depriving the agency and top leadership of intelligence necessary to assess the scope of the crisis. It was difficult for emergency vehicles and tow trucks to reach disabled vehicles and their marooned occupants because of the volume of vehicles clogging the freeway in both directions. And the number of tow truck operators was limited by spiking numbers of employees who were infected with or exposed to the coronavirus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No governor can overcome that much fresh hell. But, the report states, there were blunders. It faults clumsy communications with desperate motorists well into the disaster that only heightened their angst, particularly a Jan. 4 mid-morning VDOT text alert that promised state and local teams would arrive soon to rescue them. When that didn’t happen, drivers vented their anger on social media platforms, the report notes. Among them was an unamused Sen. Kaine, whose drive from Richmond to Capitol Hill expanded from the normal two or three hours to 27.</span><a href="https://twitter.com/timkaine/status/1478462778834833408" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">He tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a photo of the rear of a big rig stopped feet in front of him in the frozen gridlock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the vituperation stuck to Northam. And it’s easy to understand why given his handling of two significant scandals that had already rocked the final year of his term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam’s administration seemed paralyzed during the Virginia Employment Commission’s utter failure to cope with a tsunami of jobless claims from desperate Virginians suddenly unemployed because of the pandemic lockdown.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VEC had struggled to keep pace with unemployment claims in the best of times, but when the pandemic forced businesses to shutter and pushed hundreds of thousands of Virginians into unemployment, the agency was disastrously unfunctional for months on end, according to</span><a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt555.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a report last November</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the General Assembly’s investigative arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took a lawsuit and a tersely worded order by U.S. District Judge Henry Hudson to force VEC to bulk up its operations and respond to tens of thousands of frantic claimants facing financial ruin who couldn’t get VEC to even answer their repeated calls or emails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam left office having never replaced anyone in VEC’s leadership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When questions arose about the actions of the Parole Board in freeing violent inmates — including a cop killer — to thin out inmate populations in crowded prisons at the dawn of the pandemic, allegedly with insufficient legally required notice to victims’ survivors, Team Northam circled its wagons against public and media criticism and instead started hunting down leaks and whistleblowers. The Parole Board and its leadership, meanwhile, remained intact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians want to see their governors engaged and in charge in times of crisis, the way Jim Gilmore was on Sept. 11, 2001, when the Pentagon was among terrorists’ targets, and the way Kaine was 15 years ago when, hours after landing in Tokyo for a trade mission, Leighty woke him with news of the unfolding Virginia Tech massacre, and Kaine boarded the next commercial flight home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northam’s homespun, hands-off and unhurried persona didn’t serve him well in those two scandals and it prejudiced perceptions of his handling of the I-95 hellscape on ice. It didn’t help Northam that he lashed out at respected Capitol Square radio correspondent Matt Demlein when he pressed the then-governor on the fiasco in</span><a href="https://www.audacy.com/newsradiowrva/news/local/sick-and-tired-of-people-talking-about-what-went-wrong" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a live interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report does not place blame on Northam — or any specific person or institution, for that matter — and neither does Leighty, after reading the 41-page assessment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It wasn’t a failure of leadership, it was a failure of communication from the mid-level upwards,” Leighty said. “They weren’t getting the intelligence on what was happening on the ground but, in my opinion, they should have been a little bit more engaged than they were.”</span></p>

Ralph Northam in a garden at the Executive Mansion during the annual tax tribute ceremony last year. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">One thing any politician hates is a no-win situation, one in which he or she has to decide between two opposing groups and, no matter what you decide, somebody’s going to be pissed off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Virginia’s secretary of the commonwealth, Kay Coles James, seems to have such a decision in her future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kay James has been a respected, longtime conservative voice who has cycled into and out of Republican administrations in Virginia for more than 25 years. She’s not afraid to ruffle feathers if she must. And because the gathering controversy ahead of her shows no sign of working itself out, its disposition is destined for her office and, by extension, her boss, Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It involves the bitterly personal, long-simmering dispute between divergent factions within the Mattaponi Tribe of Virginia that, over the past year, has burst into an ugly and highly public feud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How ugly?</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/obscene-gesture-violated-mattaponi-chiefs-protective-order-court-finds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">In February</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, a King William County General District Court judge sentenced tribe member Steven “Wahoo” Custalow to five days and jail and a $200 fine for violating a court-issued protective order by allegedly giving the tribe’s chief, Mark Custalow, the finger.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/23/members-of-mattaponi-tribe-plan-protest-during-annual-tax-tribute-ceremony/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Last fall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the chief brought criminal charges of trespassing and assault by mob against 13 members of the tribe who protested outside his home on the sovereign reservation against the un-elected Council and called for free elections. In December, the same General District Court declined to convict the group on the misdemeanors and instead took them under advisement for a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day before Thanksgiving, the Mattaponi chief presented then-Gov. Ralph Northam with the traditional tribute of wild game in lieu of state taxes – a ceremony that predates the United States – the tribe’s dissident group gathered a few hundred feet away in traditional tribal dress to</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/29/we-have-to-take-it-back-mattaponi-protest-wants-va-to-recognize-new-leadership/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">air their grievances</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When someone surreptitiously recorded three meetings last year of the secretive Tribal Council and provided them to a YouTube channel known as the</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChRE631Dc7KzcG-SbLbnGuA" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Mattaponi Voice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, King William County authorities obtained a search warrant seeking records from global online giant Google’s Mountain View, California, headquarters in an effort to learn the source of the digital recordings. Amid unflattering media inquiries, King William County Commonwealth’s Attorney Matt Kite announced that the search warrant was being voluntarily rescinded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so it goes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Things aren’t getting any friendlier after tribal members protesting the current leadership known as the Spirit Crow Group unveiled a proposed tribal constitution that, among other things, extends the vote to tribal members who reside off the King William reservation and, for the first time, allows women to vote and hold tribal government office. It held an election on March 26 in which 41 tribal members chose a chief and Tribal Council members, a vote overseen by Cameron Quinn, who led the State Board of Elections under Govs. Jim Gilmore and Mark Warner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is time for an end to the exclusionary and secretive practices of the past,” said Lonnie “Wise Spirit” Custalow, who was elected chief in the Spirit Crow plebiscite. “Our goal is a future in which all participate and no one is left behind or left out.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, two rival councils are asserting themselves as the rightful tribal government, ratcheting tensions to an even more explosive level. The situation represents “uncharted territory,” said Claire Gastañaga, a Richmond-based lawyer advising the Spirit Crow group. And that is where James enters the picture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The secretary of the commonwealth is the liaison to the chiefs of Virginia-recognized tribes and “oversees the process of recognizing state tribes,” Gastañaga said.</span><a href="https://www.commonwealth.virginia.gov/virginia-indians/virginia-indian-advisory-board/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">The board that advises James</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on such decisions, however, is chaired by Brandon G. Custalow, son of the Mattaponi chief and a member of the current Tribal Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A Youngkin administration spokeswoman said James was not available last week for an interview about the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The folks who got elected last week are going to seek recognition, and the people on the other side are going to accuse them of misrepresenting themselves. I don’t know what will happen. Stay tuned,” Gastañaga said. &#8220;My clients hope that, ultimately, the two sides will be able to come together and focus on common interests in seeking a resolution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sitting Tribal Council accused the Spirit Crow leadership slate of misrepresenting themselves less than two days after its election. In a March 28 statement, the Council called the dissidents “a group of tribal members who have pushed political grievances too far.” It promised to present a draft of its own constitution “soon” that will extend the vote to both men and women. The release did not define “soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last time there was an election for Mattaponi Tribal Council seats was 1969, said Gastañaga, a former chief deputy Virginia Attorney General and longtime executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia. Since then, it’s been a patriarchal system in which leadership has followed the lineage of a few families, passed down only to male descendants like an heirloom. The reservation is subject to U.S. and state criminal laws, as the prosecutions in King William the past five months illustrate. The unelected chief and Tribal Council currently hold full, unfettered authority over tribal policy, including who is and is not allowed to reside on the reservation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s where a discussion like this gets uncomfortable for folks like me, descended from Europeans who invaded the continent in the first decade of the 1600s and began overrunning and robbing native people of lands they held for many centuries. That includes what the forebears of today’s Mattaponi knew as Tsenacommacah before British settlers renamed it Virginia for England’s queen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Any White person who presumes to lecture Native Americans on equitable forms of governance is well advised to just shut up. Sure, the U.S. Constitution embodies principles that, if heeded, strive to assure liberty and justice for all. But America’s indigenous people never had a say in it. Nor did African-Americans or women. It’s not perfect, but it has demonstrated the capacity to adapt to changing times and nobody has produced anything better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The history I was taught to treasure asserts that our government of the people, by the people and for the people should be a birthright, no matter one’s heritage, race, gender, faith or street address.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I think about unelected officials having people arrested for publicly gathering to air grievances; about a man jailed simply for flipping off a person in power (a claim the person convicted still vehemently denies); about a system that disenfranchises women. Then it feels wrong to remain mute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It also helps to remember that previously voiceless Mattaponi people with far more to lose than I have subordinated their legitimate concerns about their safety and retribution by the powerful and spoken up for the cause of liberty, equity and democracy where it matters most – the place they call home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I do not envy you the decision ahead, madame secretary. But I know that Kay James understands from her distinguished career in public service and conservative politics what it means to stand strong for freedom.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin’s administration says that it has wiped out a backlog of nearly 250,000 jobless claims it inherited a little more than two months ago and has reduced the number of unpaid claims pending adjudication to a few thousand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission, an agency whose performance during the height of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 lagged so badly that a federal judge ordered reforms, has eliminated a backlog of 246,273 “separation reports,” according to an email from Youngkin’s office to the Mercury over the weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statement, attributed to VEC Commissioner Carrie Roth, said that in addition to eliminating the backlog, the agency has “keeping current with new separation reports.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In addition, we had 24,887 unpaid pending claims. We have reduced this by 86 percent, including new unpaid claims, to 3,466,” Roth said in the statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roth succeeded Ellen Marie Hess, who headed the VEC throughout the term of former Gov. Ralph Northam. Northam ignored calls to shake up the agency’s leadership despite a</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/judge-declines-to-dismiss-lawsuit-over-slow-processing-of-unemployment-benefits-citing-ongoing-complaints/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 federal class action lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/08/scathing-audit-faults-poor-management-for-virginias-unemployment-insurance-failures/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a withering audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last fall by the General Assembly’s nonpartisan watchdog agency, the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC report found that the agency was woefully unprepared even to handle pre-pandemic caseloads and was poorly managed, leaving tens of thousands of newly unemployed Virginians who filed claims during the pandemic not only without vital economic assistance for months on end but unable to reach anyone at VEC to check on their claims’ status. Among its failings, the report found, was an IT system that was eight years overdue for replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin dismissed Hess as one of his first official actions in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, the agency announced that the backlog of separation reports had been cut by 89 percent, to 27,728, meaning the agency cleared that number of reports since Feb. 21. At the same time, according to a VEC release, the number of unpaid pending claims had been cut from 24,887 to $15,846.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weekend update, Roth said a “significant amount of work” remains in getting the nearly 3,500 unpaid pending claims “to a resolution for benefits they have earned.” There was no estimate for how long that task would take.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin signs legislation in February ending school mask mandates. His proposed amendments to recently passed legislation would give Virginia's state health commissioner total discretion over local health director appointments, a change some worry could undermine trust in public health authority. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may sound almost laughable now – a cruel joke, to be sure – but there was a time when Virginia had a decent Freedom of Information law. Maybe not the strongest, but workable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commonwealth first enacted laws to reasonably make government documents and meetings open to the public in 1968. It was a time when Americans were becoming rightly distrustful of what their government wasn’t telling them, particularly about the war in Vietnam and unrest at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More accurately,</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/pdf/popularname/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> put very specific restraints on government regarding what information it could hold secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first became a resident Virginia journalist nearly 28 years ago, the FOIA law was a somewhat potent tool for prying loose government records and documents that could effectively debunk what the state’s spinmeisters were saying – or, in some cases, confirm it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s before Official Richmond got tired of being accountable to the electorate and began writing new exemptions into the law each passing year. That was before those in power began contorting the law’s “governor’s working papers” exemption to cloak whatever it pleased in secrecy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each quadrennium, one hopes that a new governor will take a broader, more egalitarian view of public information than his predecessor. And each quadrennium, we’re disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Mercury’s Kate Masters pointed out the latest example in</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/23/citing-foia-exemptions-the-youngkin-administration-is-withholding-hundreds-of-pages-of-documents/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reporting last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on how Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration is reflexively denying FOIA requests pertaining to Youngkin’s top policy objectives – pledges central to his election last fall. The Mercury sought records regarding his orders to</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/EO2-Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">make masking optional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and banning instruction on “divisive concepts” (code for critical race theory) in public schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the Mercury got back from the governor’s office and relevant agencies and boards was a handful of denials. The predominant justification, cited in letters explaining why they were withheld, was the working papers exemption. The exemption itself, written into the law a quarter of a century ago, isn’t the problem. It’s the way it has been interpreted and abused, far beyond its original intent, to suppress legitimately open records and information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you’re curious about what the governor was being told about the practical health care consequences of unmasking pupils as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus was running rampant – sorry: working papers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to learn firsthand about how the new Department of Education leadership intended to purge the so-called divisive concepts and equity guidance for local schools — including perhaps how four centuries of slavery and America’s troubled racial past have influenced public policy – again: working papers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, for good measure, there’s often the universal attorney-client privilege exemption, which applies not just to the government but is a strict ethical imperative for counsel in every legal representation. It supersedes any FOIA request and can help make a denial airtight if a lawyer engaged in the matter was copied on any correspondence or was a party to any meeting – virtual or otherwise – for which notes were taken and a record was created.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if neither of those quite shuts down an inquiry, there’s money. State agencies years ago began attaching prohibitive cost estimates to deter discomfiting public records requests. Supposedly, they can’t exceed the actual costs of staff time, copying, collating, and whatnot, but toss in legal review by staff attorneys – a step necessary to determine how much, if any, of your requested information isn’t subject to some exemption – and you’re easily looking at</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/05/19/a-virginia-lawmaker-wants-to-make-foia-requests-cheaper-or-free-some-government-and-police-groups-arent-happy-about-it/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a five-figure bill.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So at that point, generally a decision must be made whether to give up, pay up, or escalate the dispute</span><b>. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the latter two options are increasingly out of the reach of many news organizations, not to mention beyond the means of the overwhelming majority of private citizen inquiries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Escalation often requires hiring your own lawyer (they don’t come cheap) and possibly suing the state. That certainly gets the government’s attention, primarily from the perspective of dicey political optics from having to state in an official record in open court why the public should not be allowed to know about public matters. Sometimes, that has a way of making the government a bit more circumspect. Rarely do such causes go to trial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t to single out Governor Youngkin. He’s only continuing a sorry trend shamelessly advanced by his predecessors. As Kate’s story notes, Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/28/working-papers-exemption-claimed-to-shield-governors-calendar-amid-pipeline-permit-uproar/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">hid his daily calendar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> behind the working papers exemption in 2018 when questions arose about his meetings with top Dominion executives just ahead of a pivotal state Air Pollution Control Board permit vote on Dominion’s since-deceased Atlantic Coast Pipeline. And before that, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe used the exemption to</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/foia-council-mcauliffes-list-for-felon-voting-order-cant-be-kept-secret-as-working-paper/article_328e310b-f333-5270-b55e-3193b1668d24.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">conceal a list of felons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose rights he had restored, some of whom had not finished their sentences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point is: why have a FOIA law if you must lawyer up and threaten to sue just to get basic, truthful information from the government that draws its sustenance from our tax dollars?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re left to wonder what those records contain that is more damning to an officeholder or more corrosive to public trust than hiding the information altogether?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While stories based on FOIA requests rarely played on the front page above the fold in the heyday of fat newspapers, they rarely set off huge scandals or brought down governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t a FOIA request that resulted in The New York Times and Washington Post publishing the Pentagon Papers, exposing lies the White House and the Pentagon had fed the public and Congress to hide how disastrously the Vietnam War was going. Nor did Watergate unravel because some federal bureaucrat, scrambling to make happy hour on a Friday, greenlighted a records request from Bob Woodward or Carl Bernstein.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, FOIAs are a commonsense stopgap, an everyman’s tool deliberately put within the citizens’ grasp, to ensure that the little things are done right and that government, at all levels, understands that the public has a reasonable right of review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a robust FOIA, small-scale wrongdoing gains the dark, airless recesses necessary to metastasize unchecked into criminal abuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s exactly where we’re headed when government chooses to peremptorily thwart legitimate, earnest requests made pursuant to our FOIA law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, there’s little public awareness of, or interest in, protecting its right of free inquiry. So those in power think nothing of eroding those rights with new exemptions every year and turning back efforts to strengthen it. For instance, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB599" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Danica Roem’s bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this year to mitigate the extortionate fees governments can exact for FOIA requests died in a subcommittee for lack of a second.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our open records and meetings laws were not created for journalists. It was created for the people, the governed. And it works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A private Montebello couple who began</span><a href="https://d.docs.live.net/2812febced1923cf/RQLewis%20LLC/THE%20READ/In%20fact,%20one%20of%20the%20most%20consequential%20scandal%20state%20government%20scandals%20began%20with%20a%20couple%20in%20Montebello%20filing%20FOIA%20requests%20to%20learn%20why%20a%20fish%20hatchery%20near%20their%20home%20was%20shuttered%20and%20ended%20in%20the%20discovery%20of%20of%20lavish%20state-funded%20trips%20and%20gifts%20that%20forced%20the%20head%20of%20the%20Department%20of%20Game%20and%20Inland%20Fisheries%20to%20resign." target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">filing FOIA requests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn why the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries shuttered a fish hatchery near their home uncovered a state-funded African safari and tens of thousands of dollars in lavish gift purchases that forced the agency’s director to resign in 2005.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is, however, an inverse relationship to the faltering health of news organizations and the government’s ability to delay or deny accountability. As trusted, traditional institutions of journalism atrophy, the forces of deceit, disinformation and nondisclosure strengthen commensurately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with so much in society today, for the average person it’s no longer a fair fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These are things he can never speak of to anyone outside the very small and tight circle of officials with the top U.S. security clearance. Things that, with a miscalculation here or a blunder there, could unleash the apocalypse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is the job of Virginia’s 69th governor and its senior U.S. senator to know these things. He is the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, a group of senators who regularly meet with the nation’s top spymasters and analysts, military minds and policymakers in an underground bunker two floors beneath the Capitol behind vault-like doors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not a job I envy. Not ever and particularly not now. Not with a deranged despot taking a crowbar to Pandora’s Box through his bloody invasion of an independent democracy in Ukraine and hinting darkly at nuclear retribution for anyone daring to stand against his crimes. One need not preside over the Intel Committee to see how those circumstances could easily ignite a World War, the first in which the major combatants possess enough thermonuclear warheads to make Earth a lifeless, radioactive cinder orbiting the sun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spent a lot of time with Mark Warner when he called the Executive Mansion in Richmond home. As a state capitol correspondent for The Associated Press, I was close to Warner at some of the most challenging moments of his term as governor from 2002 to 2006. That includes Hurricane Isabel (the last storm to slam Virginia while still packing hurricane-force winds), the mass shooting at the Appalachian School of Law and the D.C.-area snipers who shot and killed Virginians along the I-95 corridor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While those crises tested him, they were nothing compared to today’s treacherous global geopolitical scene with tensions between superpowers at their highest point since the Cuban Missile Crisis – when Warner and I were both in second grade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last week, I watched Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy address a joint meeting of Congress. By the time it ended – after a video showing the unprovoked Russian assault against his people and the bravery of their (and his) defiant response; after addressing President Joe Biden plaintively in English – I wept. Then I wondered: if this moment and all the other horrors we’ve seen in the past month affected me this much, how was Mark holding up?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, we spoke by phone on Thursday, and I asked him.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_31105" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1239235734.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-31105" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1239235734.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1239235734.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1239235734-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1239235734-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaks to the U.S. Congress by video to plead for support as his country is besieged by Russian forces at the U.S. Capitol on March 16, 2022 in Washington, DC.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think during these times, you’ve got to remember it’s not …,” he said, halting an instant to mentally refine his response. Never since I’ve known him has he been comfortable speaking introspectively about himself, at least not on the record.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“People are looking for resilience,” he resumed, speaking of how he views his role. “They’re not looking to the person per se, they’re looking for someone to play the role assigned.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2003, the day after Isabel ravaged huge swaths of Southside and Hampton Roads, he was in an Army National Guard Blackhawk helicopter on a multi-city tour to inspect the damage. I was a pool press reporter on the chopper for what became a long, exhausting day as he served as empath-in-chief, visiting worried mayors and comforting distraught owners of flooded or destroyed homes or businesses. The countryside was a tangle of flooded roads and washed-out bridges, toppled trees and snapped utility poles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We weren’t bringing additional assistance that day. It wasn’t that Mark Warner was showing up, it was that the Office of the Governor was showing up,” he said, setting up a parallel to Ukraine today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You want to show support. You’d like to physically get over there and do what you can, but it really is a moment in history. We all want to be counted as doing as much as we possibly can to support the Ukrainian people short of setting off World War III,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of which shows the incalculable responsibility and the impossible limitations this showdown between East and West presents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back in the day, I would not have imagined Warner as chair of the Intel Committee. In his life before politics and as governor, his forte was business – putting together deals and forging coalitions. He succeeded. His dealings in the embryonic era of what became the wireless communications industry before he entered elective politics makes him one of the wealthiest members of Congress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike his predecessor as governor, Jim Gilmore, Warner had no military or overseas intelligence operations experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the intellectual toolkit for the role Warner now holds was there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He has an insatiable curiosity and thirst for information. To the occasional dismay of his sleep-starved staff, he would often prowl the Internet into the wee hours in the infancy of online journalism for just-posted news dispatches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He could sniff out a flaw in a white paper or a news story faster than a bloodhound could find a porkchop, and woe unto the staffer (or journalist) responsible for the lapse. More than once, he personally called to protest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He’s inherently risk-averse and avoids gut reactions or reaching policy decisions absent sound supporting data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, as the previous quote illustrates, he’s highly disciplined in what he reveals, particularly about himself or matters he holds in confidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We live in times neither of us could have imagined in the dawning years of the 21st century when Capitol Square, not Capitol Hill, was his domain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last time brinkmanship reached this level between the United States and Russia was October of 1962. President John F. Kennedy confronted Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev over missiles he had sent to Cuba, barely 100 miles south of Florida.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the nuclear war footing of both nations was higher then, the terrain now feels less certain with fewer guardrails, Warner said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This one, the catalyst could be so much quicker,” he said. “There are so many gradations right now. The idea – and this has been in open source – that Putin’s an isolated autocrat and he’s got very few inputs, and the idea that someone could rationally think, ‘Well, maybe I could use tactical nukes…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not the kind of overnight Armageddon we thought about in Cuba, but it’s damn scary,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The strains on Washington have an almost existential feel. On one hand, Warner noted, Zelenskyy is desperate to save his country and wants the conflict to grow into one between NATO and Russia with a no-fly zone over Ukraine enforced by the United States and the European democracies. Arguably the most inspirational European leader since Winston Churchill during the World War II bombing of London, Zelenskyy has masterfully articulated Ukraine’s case worldwide, and it resounds here in the land of the free and the home of the brave.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_31131" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1383105507.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-31131" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1383105507.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1383105507.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1383105507-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1383105507-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Firefighters try to extinguish a fire after a chemical warehouse was hit by Russian shelling on the eastern frontline near Kalynivka village on March 08, 2022, in Kyiv, Ukraine.

(Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Warner concurs with Biden in opposing the use of U.S. and NATO warplanes to take out Russian aircraft or Russian surface-to-air missile batteries. So, he said, the question becomes “how do you achieve those goals without, necessarily, those tools?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now at least, that means equipping Ukraine with anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Putin’s homicidal aggression, however, has helped the world see more clearly, and that benefits America and democracy, Warner said. Nations see from Russian brutality in Ukraine a sharp definition between two competing visions for the future: in one, free people govern themselves; in the other, people exist under the merciless, bloody subjugation of a dictator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s this whole sense of ‘Can liberal democracy really function in the 21st century – the idea of a free press, the idea of debate that doesn’t break down into tribalism, … the freedom to vote. Can our system work still?’” he said. “We’ve had this kind of angsty self-doubt, yet the Ukrainian people are literally voting with their lives, saying ‘We will do anything to get what you Americans accept as a way of life.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This shows ours is the better system, the system people will die for,” he said.</span></p>

(Style Weekly)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you really want to know my weakness, here’s a hint: they have four paws, a cold nose, silky ears that they love to have scratched and pleading eyes that could extract affection from even the flintiest human heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ascribe to the theology of Will Rogers: “If there are no dogs in heaven, then when I die, I want to go where they went.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anybody who has seen me swoon over the Hanks or Georgias or Reesies or JayJays who take their owners for walks in our neighborhood or coo at the friendly woofs and wagging tails of pups along the route my wife and I walk every day can attest to this. So can anyone who has seen me pet, baby-talk or wrestle the lovably goofy rescue pups who’ve called our house home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it was that the 2022 Virginia General Assembly redeemed itself, at least in this caninophile’s eyes, for some of its trespasses against common sense and the common good with the</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-pass-new-regulations-for-controversial-beagle-breeding-facility/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">passage of five bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the waning days of its 2022 session that would place new restrictions on a beagle-breeding mill in Cumberland County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The alleged inhumane treatment of beagles – including puppies – at global biotech giant Envigo’s dog gulag has been</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/01/animal-rights-activists-question-virginia-techs-dog-purchases/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">abundantly</span></a><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/15/new-violations-found-at-va-beagle-breeding-center-which-recorded-300-unknown-puppy-deaths/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">chronicled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/22/in-virginia-why-can-corporations-treat-animals-in-ways-that-would-land-individuals-in-jail/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">commented upon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Virginia Mercury</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was documented in 2017 after U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors noted multiple violations during a routine inspection. Later that year, an animal rights organization used a drone to make a</span><a href="https://youtu.be/Ww6OgrKlRlk" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">damning video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offering a buzzard’s-eye view of dogs crowded inside a sprawling complex of cages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the years since, animal-rights groups and their right-thinking allies began pressing for legislation in Virginia to bring the compound that breeds thousands of dogs every year for medical, veterinary and biological experimentation and research under state oversight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost every year, those efforts were beaten back by the facility’s deep-pocketed owners (Envigo purchased it from Labcorp in 2019) and their posse of elite, well-paid lobbyists to navigate its resistance to state regulation around the craggy shoals of Virginia’s part-time Legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before this year’s passage, the high water mark for legislation requiring minimal standards for the animals</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/04/22/flaw-in-northams-amendment-foils-bid-to-regulate-states-largest-dog-breeding-center/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">came up short in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic. The issue didn’t even surface last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a couple of factors that did not augur well for Envigo led to a concerted legislative push this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One was back-to-back reports in</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PST_Inspection_Report_ENVIGO-RMS-LLC.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">July</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/PST_Inspection_Report_ENVIGO-RMS-LLC-3.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">October</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – again, resulting from USDA inspections – that showed compelling evidence of needless suffering among the dogs at the Cumberland facility.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_29476" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Envigo-beagles-scaled.jpeg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-29476" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Envigo-beagles-scaled.jpeg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Envigo-beagles-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Envigo-beagles-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Envigo-beagles-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Envigo-beagles-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Envigo-beagles-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Envigo-beagles-2048x1152.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Beagles enclosed in kennels at a breeding facility owned by Envigo in Cumberland, Virginia. Federal regulators and animal welfare groups have uncovered critical violations within the facility, including hundreds of puppy deaths with no causes listed. (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/08/virginia-lawmakers-pass-new-regulations-for-controversial-beagle-breeding-facility/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Kate Masters noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in reporting on the legislation last week, the second of the two federal reports found that more than a dozen female beagles were deprived of food for nearly two days even as they nursed puppies – a deliberate procedure the facility employed to expedite the weaning (and, ultimately, the wholesale purchase and transport) of puppies. It also turned up severe dental disease, eye infections and skin lesions among hundreds of adult dogs and puppies crammed in sweltering kennels for hours on end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simultaneously, Kate noted, the famously assertive People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals did a sting in which a PETA operative working surreptitiously as an animal-care technician reported that dogs were routinely euthanized without sedation and that cages were power sprayed – liquid at pressure sufficient to slash the skin or strip bark from a tree – while dogs remained inside them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only did 2021 suck from a public relations standpoint for Envigo, the reports built political support for efforts by a group of seasoned legislators who also fall easily in love with dogs – or at least won’t tolerate cruelty to them for profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envigo’s other misfortune was having skillful, seasoned and resolute legislative adversaries. None was more pivotal than Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, a conservative country trial lawyer whose fur babies include Daisy, a sweet-natured beagle that was once confined at Cumberland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the bills the General Assembly adopted this year forbids federally regulated commercial breeders who have received citations under the federal Animal Welfare Act from trafficking in dogs – a significant but reasonable guardrail on Envigo’s operation. Identical bills were offered by Stanley in the Senate and fellow Republican Del. Rob Bell of Albemarle; both passed unanimously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Standing up to Envigo this year has not only been resounding, it’s been bipartisan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A related</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB604" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Stanley co-sponsored with Democratic Sen. Jennifer Boysko of Fairfax closes a loophole in Virginia law that regulates</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title3.2/chapter65/section3.2-6507.2/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">commercial dog breeders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but gives a free pass to businesses that breed animals for medical research. That left the commonwealth with no legal basis for inspecting the Cumberland facility. The new law would classify beagles Envigo breeds at Cumberland as companion animals unless they are actively involved in clinical trials, giving state agents the right to investigate allegations of animal cruelty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envigo’s headaches don’t end with what just happened on Capitol Square.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Norfolk, and six other House members signed a letter in February exhorting the USDA to lift the Cumberland facility’s license in light of the violations it found. Maybe that will build a fire under the balky bureaucracy which has yet to levy disciplinary actions against Envigo arising from last year’s disturbing reports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, if Uncle Sam can’t get his act together, these new bills ought to allow the commonwealth, at long last, to do the right thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, that assumes Gov. Glenn Youngkin will </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sign</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the bills, now bound for his desk. He has not yet made his positions known on the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But surely a smart, rising-star GOP politico wouldn’t risk the wrath of decent, dog-loving Americans, particularly in pooch-friendly early 2024 nomination battlegrounds like Iowa and New Hampshire. Nor would he invite a stinging override from a united, bipartisan Virginia Legislature that, for the moment anyway, stands foursquare behind both Lady </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Tramp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, he just wouldn’t. Would he?</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s General Assembly has always set a low bar for campaign finance accountability. And every winter, our legislators fail to clear even that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way the state invites corruption by steadfastly rejecting even modest attempts to rein the influence of runaway, unlimited money in politics has put Virginia at the back of the class for decades in rankings by independent watchdogs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not even a scandal that nearly landed a Virginia governor in federal prison for gratuitous self-dealing with a high-roller businessman looking to game the system in favor of his company’s unproven nutritional supplement has shamed Virginia into tightening its campaign finance laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent affront came last week when a Republican-ruled House of Delegates subcommittee euthanized legislation that would prohibit candidates for state office from using unspent money raised for their political campaigns on whatever they please.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dinner at a five-star bistro? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bon appetit!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Head off with your honey for a Caribbean getaway? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bon voyage!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any or all of that is fully legal here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a bipartisan failing. Last year, similar legislation passed the House unanimously only to have its throat slit <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/02/23/virginia-senate-punts-on-campaign-finance-bill-but-lawmakers-agree-to-study-future-reform/" target="_blank">in the Senate</a>, both chambers then controlled by Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is one of only a few states that allows politicians to use unspent cash raised for campaigns to be diverted with impunity for personal use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, they’re supposed to note the purposes for which the campaign money was spent, but if they simply reimburse themselves for vague, un-itemized expenditures, that seems to work just fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most states and at the federal level, that’s a crime. And it should be in Virginia. Legislation to outlaw it here comes back every legislative session. And, just as often, lawmakers invent new ways to sidetrack it and keep the gravy train rolling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does every legislator abuse his or her campaign account for personal gain? No. Having tracked campaign finances and lobbyist disclosures from officeholders and office seekers for many years as a Capitol Square scribe, I can say that it runs the gamut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were those so scrupulous that they itemized and documented every donation, petty cash disbursement; every coffee mug or tchotchke received from a lobbyist or constituent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others would report the bare minimum or less, whether it be hunting or cultural junkets courtesy of well-connected industry or interest groups or in-kind donations – some of them worth thousands of dollars – from political boosters or lobbyists with minimal detail about the thing of value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lobbyist gifting was reined in after Gov. Bob McDonnell was convicted of federal felonies for unreported gratuities he and his family received from Jonnie Williams. Williams testified in 2014 against the former governor and his wife at the time, Maureen McDonnell, that he was trying to make his Anatabloc supplement part of state employees’ health benefits package. (Williams never got it.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McDonnell was ordered to report to prison </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/former-virginia-governor-robert-mcdonnell-spared-prison-sentence-n599506" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the convictions.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But political cash? It continues to flow unrestrained, even as more states have imposed limits over the first two decades of the 21st century.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has always asserted a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">laissez faire</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> argument for political finances – give as much as you want (individuals, PACs, corporations, unions, you name it) but report all you give.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well into the 1990s, that was little more than a taunt as campaign finance reports filed by donors and candidates were on paper forms – literally tons of them, filling huge storerooms. You could hide almost anything that way until the mid-’90s when the</span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/money/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Public Access Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> began punching data from the paper forms into sortable electronic databases and making the information available, initially to media organizations that helped support it and ultimately to the world at no cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the extent that the unlimited giving/full disclosure model works in Virginia, it’s a tribute to VPAP.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even those advances have their limits. Campaign finance law constantly changes, creating new ways for shadowy influence groups to flood the system with anonymous “dark money” concealing its true source and its related public policy objectives at least until the elections are over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also little downside to providing misleading, incomplete or evasive information on campaign finance reports. Virginia law prescribes a</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter9.3/section24.2-946.3/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">civil fine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – not even a misdemeanor – for campaign finance reporting violations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t bet on Virginia limiting donations or spending soon. We’ll continue to see the wealthy flood the system and bend it to their desires, but they already do that – even at the federal level with all its regulations – through Super PACs and dark money groups. In theory, if disclosure can be assured, there’s a philosophical argument in support of bottomless campaign giving and spending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what happened last Wednesday in a House Privileges and Elections subcommittee wasn’t just a missed layup. It was a team finding a way to throw the game.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB463" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had passed the Senate 37-3. Its patron, Sen. John Bell, D-Loudoun, stood before a handful of delegates knowing that one bill to limit personal use of campaign money had already died in the Republican-ruled House. He had toned down his bill so that buying pizza for campaign volunteers or outfitting them with campaign-logo T-shirts would not be a violation. He was ready to cut more deals to win the panel’s favor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One provision he considered a selling point allowed campaign money to pay for child care for campaign volunteers. Some states that ban personal use of campaign funds have added such exceptions to their law to foster volunteer participation in campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in a remarkable display of legislative judo, Del. Kim Taylor, R-Dinwiddie, argued that campaigns have no business aiding volunteers with kids.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is a personal expense. It’s something you go into your campaign knowing you’re going to have to make arrangements for,” Taylor said according to</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/02/virginia-lawmakers-still-cant-bring-themselves-to-ban-personal-use-of-campaign-cash/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=8196de8b-8e11-4318-a3fc-a47abc22be0b" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Graham Moomaw’s reporting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Mercury. Bell offered to remove it, notwithstanding Taylor’s seeming failure to recognize the conflict in her logic – that tanking the bill guaranteed that campaigns can continue spending money on exactly that (or any other) purpose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor and the panel’s four other Republicans voted to table Bell’s bill; its three Democrats voted to advance it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bell acknowledged that the bill wasn’t perfect but noted that it “will take care of the most egregious things.” It was a belief shared by the Senate’s top Republican, Minority Leader Tommy Norment of James City.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People should know we’re here to serve… not to enrich ourselves,” Bell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the laziest rationalization for deep-sixing the bill came from Del. Margaret Ransone, chair of the full P&amp;E Committee, who fashioned a facile justification from Bell’s and Norment’s candor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Putting something in code that’s not perfect, that’s not just right, I feel like is wrong,” said Ransone, R-Westmoreland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfection? Fallibility is indigenous to legislation authored by humans, particularly in a part-time deliberative body like our General Assembly. It has begat comically flawed legislation, yet here the perfect was made the enemy of the good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <a href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20040711-2004-07-11-0407110069-story.html" target="_blank">2</a>004,<a href="https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-20040711-2004-07-11-0407110069-story.html" target="_blank"> a bill that accidentally reinstated Sunday closing law</a>s dating to the 17th century won unanimous approval in the Virginia Senate and passed the House of Delegates 88-9. It became law, forcing the General Assembly to return to Richmond in June to fix it before it could force the closure of stores and factories on the Christian Sabbath after its July 1 effective date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the legislature’s intellectual product has blown right past imperfect hell bent for moronic. In 2005, the House voted 60-34 to levy a $50 fine on anyone caught wearing trousers slung so low as to prominently display undergarments. Wiser heads prevailed before that one could become law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If our elected lawmakers want Virginia to remain a backwater when it comes to campaign finance accountability and allow money solicited for public policy purposes to become personal slush funds, just say so. Voters would find the honesty refreshing.</span></p>

James Gilmore (R-VA) at an election night watch party at the Westfields Marriott Washington Dulles on Nov. 2, 2021 in Chantilly, Virginia. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine marks the start of a 100-year global struggle between the forces of authoritarianism and the democratic nations of the world, former Virginia Gov. and U.S. emissary to Europe Jim Gilmore said Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is a long war that is ahead of us here. I’m not talking about the Ukrainian war; I’m talking about the war between the authoritarian countries and the freedom countries. This is going to be maybe a 100-year war to determine what the future of the world is going to be,” said Gilmore, who served for two years as the U.S. special ambassador to the 57-nation</span><a href="https://www.osce.org/participating-states" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a webinar sponsored by the conservative Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, Gilmore said that President Joe Biden’s foreign policy “weakness” emboldened Russian leader Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine, a sovereign Russian neighbor that was part of the Soviet bloc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But once the invasion began, he said, Biden showed strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I believe the president has done a 180,” Gilmore said. “I believe he figured it out. I believe that he is now behaving much more strong. He has sent troops into Eastern Europe, which is absolutely the right thing to do. If you’re not going to use troops (in Ukraine), he’s threatened real sanctions, and we need to be doing real sanctions. I’ve said publicly that whatever sanctions he’s thinking about, he ought to do them and double them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gilmore said it seems inevitable that, despite a tenacious resistance Ukraine has mounted against Russia’s superior firepower, Russia would likely overrun the country. However, it will never bend Ukraine’s fiercely patriotic people to its will or have peace as long as it occupies the country, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But we can arm the Ukrainians, who are doing pretty good,” Gilmore said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Had the United States provisioned the Ukrainian military with anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles over the past few years, the 40-mile column of Russian tanks and artillery stalemated on a highway north of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv “would be toast right now, literally toast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know how Putin thinks he’s going to do his original plan. He’s not going to reverse Ukraine and make it a satrap of Russia,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gilmore said he sees no danger of a nuclear confrontation from the war in Ukraine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just don’t think you use nuclear weapons in a situation like this unless your country is completely threatened and nobody is threatening Russia proper at this point,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Putin’s gamble that the invasion would fracture the Western alliance has disastrously backfired, Gilmore said. The United Kingdom has leaned heavily into severe economic and social sanctions against Russia. Germany, highly reliant on Russia for energy, is resolute on punishing Putin, he noted, and even the historically neutral nations of Finland and Switzerland are doubling down on sanctions against Russia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gilmore was appointed special ambassador to OSCE based in Vienna by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 2019. He said he believed Biden might retain him after he achieved a leadership post within the organization, but was swiftly replaced not long after Biden’s inauguration last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He served as a U.S. Army counterintelligence officer in Europe during the 1970s. As governor from 1998 to 2002, he swiftly took charge of Virginia’s response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and was on the scene with Virginia first-responders at the Pentagon the day after a hijacked airliner crashed into its western wall.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin signed legislation earlier this month ending school mask mandates. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a familiar script. Virginia elects a new governor who, in our off-off-year cycles, briefly captures half the nation’s imagination and becomes the hottest new thing since clip-on neckties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it takes on even greater breathlessness when the new governor bursts onto the scene seemingly from nowhere to upset a towering politico with national stature and the demonstrated ability to raise more money than <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Croesus" target="_blank">Croesus</a>. Toss in the fact that the loser was an immediate past-governor and … well, the story writes itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s where Glenn Youngkin found himself on the morning of Nov. 3, 2021 — figuratively astride the prostrate political career of the vanquished Terry McAuliffe, his crown toppled to one side. Add in the motto </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sic semper Democratae</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and you have a tableau</span><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/local-breaking-news/cuccinelli-unveils-modest-vers.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans might deem worthy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a revised Great Seal of Virginia (especially since Youngkin’s red, zip-up, campaign-logo fleece vest would tastefully conceal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">both</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nipples).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The win</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">sent gigawatts coursing through the GOP grid nationally. Here was a campaign that proved a new post-Trump concept for victory in a state where Republicans had gone winless statewide for a full dozen years and where Democrats had, during that time, overtaken every statewide office and institution of government at both the state and federal level. The last time the GOP was so thoroughly out of power in Virginia was the year Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and, even more stunning, the Mets won the World Series.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling it audacious is like calling Elon Musk well-to-do. Youngkin and his team devised a gravity-defying strategy in which the campaign never </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">embraced</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Donald Trump but didn’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">reject</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> him, either. Equivalent to a hole-in-one, it was the only hope the political rookie had of energizing a massive turnout of Trump-loving Republicans while also eroding the Democrats’ advantage among suburban moderates who loathe the former president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the sun rose the morning after Election Day, Republicans were already circulating memos memorializing the Youngkin gameplan – particularly his strategy of weaponizing local school conflicts in the unsettled aftermath of the pandemic and the 2020 George Floyd summer of unrest to capture the imagination of Democrat-friendly suburbanites.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You could hardly blame him for thinking he’s game for a 2024 presidential run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From that perspective, it made sense that Youngkin issued 11 executive decrees before supper his first day in office for an audience of hardcore GOP loyalists at the expense of winning friends he would need in the Democratic-controlled Senate to pass his legislative agenda. Though of limited authority – as executive orders and directives are – and perhaps legally dubious, as plaintiffs allege his unilateral dictate to school boards end mask mandates was, those executive actions could make compelling brochures and talking points at GOP gatherings in New Hampshire and Iowa a couple of years hence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not the first to opine on Youngkin’s supposed ambitions. Some mighty knowledgeable folks – including an esteemed former</span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/commentary-youngkin-sheds-moderate-image-in-first-month/article_1b773e88-8e75-11ec-ace4-5baf44a6c268.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">press corps colleague</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a respected</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/02/07/who-is-youngkins-real-audience/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">political science professor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – beat me to the punch. So, I put the question to the governor himself, or at least his spokesfolks. I asked: Will the governor run for president while he’s still governor? Youngkin’s press secretary, Macaulay Porter, helpfully referred me to a noncommittal response Youngkin gave to a similar question during a</span><a href="https://youtu.be/jxw7MKzNqSA" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (around the 7:40 mark) earlier this month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia governors get sized up as presidential timber w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hether they want to or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe it’s because we’re right on D.C.’s doorstep. Maybe it’s the fact that Virginia is the birthplace of eight presidents: in reverse chronological order, Woodrow Wilson, Zachary Taylor, John Tyler, William Henry Harrison, James Monroe, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Only three governors – Jefferson, Tyler and Monroe – held both offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Jefferson counted neither office among his top three accomplishments: His tombstone epitaph at Monticello lists him as the author of the Declaration of Independence and the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom and the father of the University of Virginia.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only Virginia native to inhabit the White House since the Civil War, the Staunton-born Wilson held the office from 1913 to 1921 and lived here in his childhood but became president after serving as governor of New Jersey and president of Princeton University.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The record has not been kind to Virginians since then.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Chuck Robb was the son-in-law of President Lyndon Johnson and at one time seemed to many destined for the Oval Office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Doug Wilder tested the waters in New Hampshire and Iowa in the winter of 1991-92. A grandson of enslaved people and the nation’s first elected Black governor, Wilder sought to parlay his historical renown and his strong early popularity into a fast start in the Democratic primaries. He never gained traction and his polling numbers tanked back home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next three governors also made forays into early nomination battlegrounds, but only after their terms ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Allen, who left office in 1998 and won a U.S. Senate term two years later, was distracted by his GOP presidential prospects in 2006 and undertook an uninspired re-election campaign that never recovered from serious<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2011/06/allen-apologizes-for-macaca-moment-056212" target="_blank"> late-campaign gaffes</a>. He narrowly lost to Democrat Jim Webb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Gilmore offered himself as a Republican hopeful in 2008 and again in 2016. Both campaigns fizzled on the launch pad, and he regrouped for an unsuccessful senatorial bid in 2008.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilmore’s successor, Democrat Mark Warner, formed a presidential exploratory committee shortly after leaving office in 2006 and abruptly abandoned it several months later. He defeated Gilmore in 2008 for the Senate seat he still holds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when sitting governors don’t actively flirt with a national run, sometimes pundits and an adrenaline-addicted press corps do it for him. That happened in August of 2008 when it looked as though Gov. Tim Kaine would be Barack Obama’s running mate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A phalanx of network television cameras and their toothy, well-coiffed correspondents bivouacked for several days outside the Executive Mansion. It reached its cartoonish crescendo one afternoon when Kaine, First Lady Anne Holton and the eldest of their three kids, Nat, gave everyone the slip by using Capitol Square’s little-known tunnel system to enter the Capitol and exit undetected from its newly finished subterranean extension to a waiting black SUV and his security detail parked steps away on Bank Street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were driven to George Washington University to move Nat into the dorm for his freshman year without turning it into a media carnival. By the time the press learned that Kaine was on the campus, he was already on his way back into Virginia where he boarded a private jet bound westward — toward Denver and the Democratic National Convention. Armed with the plane’s tail number, The Associated Press frantically tracked Kaine’s path as competitive pressure mounted to proclaim him the VP nominee. The tension broke late in the night after the plane landed well short of Colorado and the Secret Service took up positions outside the Wilmington, Delaware, home of Sen. Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eight years later, as a U.S. senator, Kaine came closer than any sitting Virginia officeholder since the 19th century when he made it onto Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful ticket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob McDonnell received VP buzz almost from the time he was elected in 2009. Similar to the Kaine veepwatch, AP and other news organizations stayed up late one night in 2012 trying to learn whether McDonnell would be announced the next morning as Mitt Romney’s running mate in a grand event alongside the U.S.S. Wisconsin, a storied World War II battleship permanently moored as a floating museum in Norfolk. When the big reveal came, it was Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, not the governor of Virginia, who bounded down the gangplank and onto the ticket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McAuliffe, always relevant as Clinton confidante, never seemed far from speculation about some national run whether he was governor or not, perhaps because he never discouraged it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam was the exception. Any negligible talk about a ticket spot for him vanished in 2019 with the discovery of a racist photo on his</span><a href="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/richmond.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/c8/ac8cee24-ce19-5eed-8252-78de49f31c58/5c54bb4a74115.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C842" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">medical school yearbook page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who knows? Maybe Youngkin has the secret sauce generations of Virginia governors lacked. Maybe he can upstage Trump without alienating the MAGA movement he needs to secure a GOP nomination. Maybe he can balance the dual demands of keeping Virginians happy while doing his song-and-dance in Manchester and Des Moines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before he starts hiring field staff in other states, he would do well to give Governor Wilder a call.</span></p>

(Photo by Graham Moomaw)</p><p><b>News item:</b> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Virginia senator pushes legislation to prohibit gambling companies from ripping off the commonwealth’s universally recognized, trademarked tourism marketing pitch line, “Virginia is for Lovers.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story left me torn, as I suspect was true for a lot of Virginians. Bookmakers and casino operators had bastardized the commonwealth’s 53-year-old slogan with “Virginia is for Bettors.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps more than any other four-word vacation industry declaration ever uttered, Virginia’s association with lovers has withstood the test of time, proving itself as perennially resonant as it is resilient.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its debut, “Virginia is for Lovers” has earned pretty much every meaningful accolade that a marketing campaign can. It is to tourism promotion what Tom Brady is to quarterbacking and Michael Jordan is to the windmill slam dunk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its genius is its simplicity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, the campaign was envisioned with modifiers such as “History Lovers” or “Outdoors Lovers” or “Art Lovers.” But ditching the descriptors left a cleaner, more direct and memorable slogan that rolls naturally off the tongue, can be appropriated to most any purpose, yet tastefully suggests an actual </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">aventure romantique</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a breakout campaign for Richmond advertising prodigies George Woltz and David Martin, partners in the firm that blossomed into The Martin Agency, creator of prominent campaigns for such national brands as</span><a href="https://martinagency.com/work/door-dash-dash-pass" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">DoorDash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://martinagency.com/work/old-navy-bodequality" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Old Navy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://martinagency.com/work/oreo-holiday-twist" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Oreo cookies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and, perhaps most memorably,</span><a href="https://martinagency.com/work/geico-what-are-you-waiting-for" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">GEICO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and its Cockney-accented </span><a href="https://youtu.be/2YEKgDcmlD4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spokesgecko</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://media.rvanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Virginia-is-for-lovers-1969-ad-1.jpg" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first “Lovers” ad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in the March 1969 issue of</span><a href="https://i2.wp.com/the-avocado.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/img_1425.jpg?resize=720%2C959&amp;ssl=1" target="_blank"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modern Bride</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, re-imagines a wedding in the Jamestown settlement that is believed to be the first in an English colony in the Americas. In bold white type against the dark, monochrome photo of models in period costume portraying the bride and groom: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1608, Anne Burras and John Laydon started something. The Virginia Honeymoon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, “Lovers” has been adapted to countless tourism promotions as varied as music festivals, outreach to foodies on behalf of elite restaurants, Winchester’s spring Apple Blossom Festivals, the annual Chincoteague Pony Swim and, naturally, honeymoon venues and romantic getaways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when corporate bookmakers that now glut the gaming landscape made a clumsy play to bastardize Virginia’s slogan with “Virginia is for Bettors,” Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment saw red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norment, R-James City, heard the phrase in an ad on his car radio during a drive to Richmond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Frankly, it annoyed me,” Norment told a Senate gambling subcommittee last month as</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/a-senator-was-annoyed-by-a-virginia-is-for-bettors-ad-now-he-wants-to-ban-them/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">originally reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Virginia Mercury&#8217;s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Graham Moomaw. “We’ve spent a lifetime trying to market ‘Virginia is for Lovers.’ I just felt it was trespassing on it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Damn skippy, Tommy. I’m right there with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t invest as much time and treasure as the Virginia Tourism Corporation has lo these many years to sustain and build a wildly successful trademark only to see it manhandled by some garish outside interest, particularly a line of work punishable by prison time not long ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I applaud the senator’s resolve to nip this in the bud, I question his proposed remedy: a whole new state law that specifically targets the use of “Virginia is for Bettors” by sports betting and casino gaming operators and their affiliates to advertise their products and services. Violators would be subject to a civil penalty as high as $50,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see the slippery slope such an approach presents for the commonwealth and its elected policymakers. At what point is no peeve so pedantic as not to warrant a new section in the</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Code of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to forbid it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isn’t that one of the reasons we have courts and intellectual property law?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is, Norment said in an interview last week. A lawyer himself, he said that a cease-and-desist letter from an attorney or even being served with a complaint, filed with a court of proper jurisdiction, would be the usual approach. But, unlike the vast majority of Virginians, Norment has in his arsenal the awesome might of Virginia’s lawmaking apparatus to aim at that which annoys him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As much as anything else, I did this to send a message,” he said. “And I think I got their attention.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said seeing the tourism mantra misappropriated struck a nerve, and I can relate. His 3rd Senate District includes some of Virginia’s most celebrated historical tourism venues – Jamestown and Yorktown – and it borders Colonial Williamsburg. That’s a big deal, especially in his neck of the woods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from being ticked off, Norment said he was concerned that the usual legal steps might not produce results as swiftly as legislation that would be widely covered by a Capitol press corps always hungry for a bill dripping in pop-culture buzz.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought they might take the attitude, ‘Let’s run with this as long as we can get away with it and maybe there’s no downside to it,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The earned media his bill has garnered, he added, “has captured the attention of the gaming operations to the point where they’ve stopped running the ad.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">True enough. A quick Google search shows plenty of coverage of his</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb96" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 96</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the mainstream media with which Norment has had an often fractious relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill won unanimous passage in the Democratic-controlled Senate on Feb. 8 and is now in the Republican-ruled House of Delegates for consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So now that the “bettors” spots have been taken down by seemingly chastened gambling interests, is it time to move on, declare victory and let SB96 die? Might Virginia lawmakers think better of what amounts to killing a horsefly with a Howitzer?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t bet on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Norment is intent on seeing the bill through House passage in the remaining weeks of the 2022 General Assembly and having Gov. Glenn Youngkin sign it into law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If there is another entity out there that might think about trespassing on our tourism marketing, I want this to make them think again,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This wouldn’t be the first time Virginia has cluttered its books with mole hills made into mountains – or at least given it one hell of a try.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2000, the General Assembly passed, and Virginia voters ratified, an amendment to the state Constitution protecting a right to hunt and fish that was on nobody’s endangered species list. Five years later, a bill that would have fined teens for wearing trousers so low as to prominently expose their underwear (or worse) passed the House before the Senate put it out of its misery. In 2008, then-Del. (and now Sen.) Lionell Spruill Sr., D-Chesapeake, passionately (albeit unsuccessfully)</span><a href="https://youtu.be/VSp1IguWU3s" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">advocated on the House floor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for legislation that would outlaw</span><a href="https://bullsballs.com/products/truck-nuts" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Truck Nutz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – replica testicles, available in a wide array of festive colors and designs, that dangle from the rear bumpers of pickup trucks. In 2012, Virginia became</span><a href="https://www.cc.com/video/83xa8q/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-punanny-state-virginia-s-transvaginal-ultrasound-bill" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a comedians’ goldmine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a bill that would have compelled women seeking abortions to first undergo invasive vaginal ultrasound exams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am no fan of the gaming industry. I don’t bet on sports, not so much out of any sense of moral disdain but, rather, because I am a hopeless pessimist slouching toward fatalism. Seriously, I could find a way to lose a bet on the sun rising in the east, so I have a deathly fear of the smartphone sports book apps that would gladly suck my bank account dry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, sports wagering operated outside the law even as the names and hangouts of bookies were open secrets in every community in America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, in Virginia, it is a fully legal and robustly marketed corporate enterprise, yielding substantial revenues to the commonwealth since it got rolling last year. Legal sports gambling was enabled by a</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html?smid=url-share" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 U.S. Supreme Court ruling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and by</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/lawmakers-approve-casinos-and-sports-betting-prohibit-bets-on-virginia-college-teams/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation enacted in 2020</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the same Virginia General Assembly that is about to pass an extraordinary targeted rebuke for ripping off a venerated tourism phrase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When all is said and done, Virginia will still be for lovers and its slogan safe from imitators. Let us rejoice in that. But we’re also left to ponder: is this the highest and best use of those we send to Richmond to write our laws?</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin is sworn in to office in front of the Capitol on Jan. 15, 2022. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There ought to be a crash course – an orientation of sorts – for guys like Glenn Youngkin who get elected governor having never spent a moment in elective public office. It’s almost unfair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, a Republican, came to office like Mark Warner, 20 years before him, and Terry McAuliffe, the former governor he defeated last fall, from a world of boardrooms, deals brokered privately and unquestioned executive fiat unencumbered by public scrutiny, media criticism or contrarian legislatures. All three were multimillionaires when they were elected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the metrics for success in elective office — particularly the highest office in the state — couldn’t be more different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the world of elite business, a good transaction is one from which everyone either walks away satisfied – their bottom lines fattened and shareholders happy – or at least in no position to raise hell publicly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Government, however, is counterintuitive — even alien — to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Saturday after the second Wednesday of January every fourth year, they raise their hands, swear a sacred oath, give a speech, then do a full-on cannonball into the deep end of the pool. Political neophytes do so either unaware that it has been stocked with ravening piranha or holding the foolish conceit that they can reason with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The biggest blind spot that political newbies face when they become governor is the limitations that come with a public sector job. Governors are scrutinized in ways CEOs are not and governors face restive legislatures while CEOs usually have pretty docile boards of directors and loyal underlings,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor and director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increasingly, governance in the age of tribalism is a zero-sum game played by Machiavelli’s rules in which victory for one side means absolute defeat and humiliation for the other. It’s full of trip wires and pitfalls that are, at a minimum, frustrating and often devastating to the uninitiated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin isn’t the first Virginia governor to find himself chaotically thrashing about in his early weeks, and he’s felt the consequences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His experience differs from previous novice governors who leaped from business into the Executive Mansion. Yet there are lessons he could learn from his predecessors’ tenures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Warner and McAuliffe had never won election themselves, they came to the role with considerably more political grounding than Youngkin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner helped guide Democrat L. Douglas Wilder’s historic 1989 election as the nation’s first elected Black governor. Since no good deed goes unpunished in politics, Wilder appointed Warner to chair the Democratic Party of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven years later, Warner sought to unseat Virginia’s venerated Republican senior senator, John W. Warner. He came closer in the 1996 Warner vs. Warner race than anyone who challenged the courtly, handsome “senator from central casting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McAuliffe, by contrast, had been a consummate salesman and dealmaker since his childhood. The living embodiment of “the life of the party,” he rose to prominence as a close friend, adviser and fundraiser for a little-known Arkansas governor who parlayed voter fatigue over the early ‘90s recession and Reagan-era “trickle-down economics” into two White House terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gregarious upstate New York native became one of Washington’s A-List power brokers during the Clinton years and headed the Democratic National Committee for four years afterward. His life as an elite politico was an open book –</span><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780312377755/whataparty" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">literally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – before his failed 2009 bid for his party’s Virginia gubernatorial nomination and his 2013 encore when he won it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To differing degrees, Warner and McAuliffe were both Blue Dog Democrats who staked their claims in the political median, betting heavily on their ability to cut deals with adversaries, grow Virginia’s economy and advance their agenda, at least as much of it as they could through haggling and dickering with a GOP legislature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Macker is best remembered for single-handedly restoring voting rights for nearly 200,000 felons who had fully paid their debt to society, in many cases years or even decades earlier. He also made a record number of gubernatorial vetoes (120) as a “brick wall” against Republican bills tightening access to abortions and voter registration and easing restrictions on firearm use and possession. He battled to expand Medicaid to an additional 400,000 Virginians, and while it didn’t pass during his term, he had teed it up for passage under his successor, Gov. Ralph Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warner, by far the more risk-averse of the two Democrats, governed in a much different time. He carefully nurtured the bipartisan bona fides he had stressed as a candidate, essentially running as GOP Lite. His thing was economic development, public schools and roads. He promised no broad tax increases, no new curbs on gun rights – the Connecticut-raised Alexandrian with a weakness for Starbucks lattes even campaigned in rural Virginia as “</span><a href="https://vimeo.com/472578633" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a good ol’ boy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” He pledged fiscal restraint and to govern like a prudent businessman. He had no desire to clash with the burgeoning Republican legislative majorities on cultural issues such as LGBTQ rights (the acronym wasn’t even in common use then), school prayer or abortion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember the earnest new governor appearing early in his term with House Speaker S. Vance Wilkins and other GOP legislative leaders at joint press conferences announcing initiatives, only to watch Republicans gleefully begin poisoning them as soon as the “Kumbaya” media events ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took Warner two years to get his sea legs, and by then he had mastered the game well enough to rope-a-dope House Republicans into a strategic blunder and decisively earn his signature legislative triumph.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the state facing worsening shortfalls during the recession of the early 2000s, Warner and his team had carefully, incrementally persuaded Virginians weary of clogged roads and crumbling schools that structural reforms to an inequitable state tax code were necessary. His solution would increase taxes for some but decrease or keep them unchanged for most. In the extra-innings 2004 legislative session that dragged into April, House GOP leadership smugly declared a recess so members could return home and “refresh ourselves with the will of the voters.” Rather than finding the anti-tax amen chorus they expected, many of them were confronted with school auditoriums filled with fed-up taxpayers and a clear message: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">get back to Richmond and fix this!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Warner had flipped 17 moderate Republicans to his position by the time the dispositive votes were taken, more than enough to secure passage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the GOP’s further dismay, Warner’s legislative win only made him more popular. His out-the-door job approval rating in late October 2005 was 80 percent, still the highest ever measured for a departing Virginia governor in polling by The Washington Post/George Mason University Schar School of Government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin, by contrast, went hard partisan hours after his inauguration, issuing 11 executive decrees, one of which has already provoked</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/07/supreme-court-of-virginia-punts-on-first-school-mask-lawsuit/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">legal challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Among them was a legally dubious order directing local school districts to end COVID-era mask mandates and another that forbids public school educators from getting into “</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inherently divisive concepts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” like critical race theory. It was political theater that appeased his own party’s conservative base but was a shot across the bow of the Democratic-ruled Senate where some of Youngkin’s cabinet</span><a href="https://twitter.com/SenLouiseLucas/status/1491124778484527106" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nominations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/11/lawmakers-pivot-to-lab-schools-as-senate-committee-kills-charter-legislation/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">policy priorities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have since been merrily euthanized.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Youngkin ran a very strong campaign but has not made the transition from campaigning mode to governing mode,” said Mark Rozell, a political science professor and dean of GMU’s Schar School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stoking conflict from the start at the expense of brokering accord across party lines may work as a predicate for a future bid for higher office – perhaps the 2024 presidential primaries. But it doesn’t advance promised long-term policy goals, especially in a divided legislature, Rozell said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not going to come naturally to a former CEO who’s used to saying, ‘Do this, don’t do that,’ and things get done as opposed to negotiating important decisions and building consensus,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether Youngkin does the hard work of governing depends on where he wants to be in a few years. If that’s in Iowa and New Hampshire wooing GOP primary voters, good for him. But he may have to do it without a serious legislative portfolio.</span></p>

(Spencer Tassone/Virginia Commonwealth University)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s rare that Virginia’s governors and budget writers have the luxury to look over a state treasury flush with cash and struggle to figure out how to spend it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe while it’s top-of-mind, just a thought: Pour as much as you can into modernizing Virginia’s public infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Consider for a moment: revenues that feed the state’s operational general fund, which pays for such basics as public education, health care and law enforcement, came in for the fiscal year that ended last June 30 at $3.1 billion, or 14.4 percent, greater than the prior fiscal year’s collections. That’s the largest dollar-amount year-over year increase in Virginia history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the end of calendar 2021, the state sat atop a $2.6 billion surplus, some of which is already spoken for. The Virginia Constitution gets first dibs through mandatory set-asides in flush times into the commonwealth’s Rainy Day Fund. For the budget now under consideration through the middle of 2024, that would amount to $1.7 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are other statutory claims on state revenue windfalls, too. But that leaves plenty for the General Assembly and the governor to divvy up to satisfy pressing needs of the commonwealth as well as their own constituencies and own policy goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The prevailing political zeitgeist, as manifest in November’s election, augurs decidedly toward returning the money directly back to Virginians in the form of rebates and tax breaks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s always a laudable intention to put some hard-earned currency back in the bank accounts of taxpayers. No argument that voters last fall spoke clearly that they don’t believe they’re being taxed too little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Virginia’s economy, roughed up mightily a couple of years ago by the pandemic, would doubtless benefit from refunds and tax savings embedded in current legislation that would end the state’s share of the sales tax on groceries, roll back the recent gasoline tax increase, double the standard deduction for state income tax filers and put more of military retirees’ benefits off-limits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It used to be an unwritten but widely accepted practice on Capitol Square that when Virginia had good revenue collection years and found itself with fattened finances, one-time revenues went to one-time needs like repairing or replacing rundown roads and bridges, new construction on state-supported institutions of higher learning and aid to K-12 facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what if we returned money to Virginians not so much in a check or tax savings but in ways that pay both short and longer-term dividends?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe this is an excellent time to again consider a significant investment in basic upgrades that not only keep the commonwealth competitive among its sister states in the never-ending quest for quality business growth and expansion but to leapfrog over them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What do major employers look for when they’re shopping for a site to put a major expansion like those Amazon is making in Virginia and Texas?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Low taxes, sure. Who wants to give a larger piece of earnings to the government rather than shareholders (and the obscene compensation packages of chief executives)?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But any state can do tax deals, and a race to the bottom isn’t a workable continuing strategy for landing the best jobs or building the sort of communities workers want to call home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Safe transportation matters. Good roads and new, well-maintained bridges as well as abundant rail service that keep their vital supply chains open catch the eyes of corporate location scouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Virginia is in the middle of the pack nationally, ranking 25</span><span style="font-weight: 400">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> in the number of structurally deficient bridges, according to</span><a href="https://artbabridgereport.org/state/profile/VA" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">fresh data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. Of Virginia’s nearly 14,000 bridges, only 530, or 3.8 percent, are rated structurally deficient, down from 773 that met that definition in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That may sound like an acceptable risk unless the bridge you’re driving across happens to be the one out of every 25 that’s structurally unsound. More of the largesse now available could reduce those risks even further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Expanding companies want good schools from pre-K all the way to relevant college graduate-level programs plus a healthy community college and tech school system that are front-line employee training facilities for their massive manufacturing operations that require highly skilled workers. When they see students in crumbling New Deal-era structures where they swelter in the summer, shiver in the winter and deal with leaky roofs year-round, they can’t skedaddle fast enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The needs there are significant, as my colleague Roger Chesley compellingly</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/03/if-it-wont-help-the-legislature-should-get-out-of-the-way-on-school-construction/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">illustrated last week</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. More than half of Virginia’s public school buildings are at least 50 years old, he reported. And he cited a</span><a href="http://dls.virginia.gov/commissions/scm.htm" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">legislative commission report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from last year that placed the cost to the commonwealth of replacing the 1,000-plus buildings dating to 1970 or earlier is nearly $25 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if local school construction </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">was</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> a primary state government responsibility (it’s not), the surplus isn’t large enough for the state to stroke a check for that whole amount. But it’s beyond debate that the commonwealth can, does and should play a role in addressing the most inequitable disparities between wealthy and poor districts and has the means to do far beyond what it’s doing now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A corporate search posse demands a sturdy, hardened, modern electrical grid resistant to the depredations of weather and hostile hackers that can shut their operations down and cost them millions of dollars daily (see last year’s epic</span><a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/02/texas-winter-storm-final-death-toll-246/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Texas power grid failure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that caused 246 people for reference). While the commonwealth doesn’t run the electrical utilities (to the contrary, many would argue that</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/02/political-power-shifts-in-richmond-but-resistance-to-campaign-finance-limits-remains-the-same/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Virginia’s dominant utility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> runs the commonwealth), the state does have the legal and regulatory authority to incentivize such investments by private-sector providers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They demand universal, crazy-fast digital broadband access, not just for their offices and factories but for support, professional and administrative staff whose ability to work remotely has been essential during the pandemic lockdowns to meeting the demands of a 24-hour economy. In present day Virginia, urban and suburban areas do quite well with abundant high-speed internet availability, but rural Virginia – as is disproportionately and unfairly the case – is left out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As noted in this column last year, a study by the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service shows the deep digital disconnect in Virginia. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Plotted on a locality-by-locality map of Virginia, those with the best high-speed Internet access such as fiber-optic, cable or DSL lines show up in ever-darkening shades from the least (tan) to the most (burnt umber). Those where fewer than half of the households have such access show up as beige.</span><a href="https://www.socialexplorer.com/612eb12c76/view" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">This interactive image</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> shows vast pale-shaded digital deserts in rural areas, especially the Southside and Southwest Virginia regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Help already appears on the way. The $1.2</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/15/us/politics/biden-signs-infrastructure-bill.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Bipartisan Infrastructure and Jobs Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, passed by Congress days after last fall’s election and signed into law by President Joe Biden, will provide billions nationally for universal highspeed internet. And the General Assembly last year allocated millions more for</span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/vati" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400">Virginia Technology Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> grants to expand broadband into areas of need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Infrastructure isn’t sexy, but it’s smart. It’s an investment in ourselves as a commonwealth. It may not pack the immediate thrill of a rebate check or getting a refund rather than owing on your state income taxes, but building infrastructure creates well-paying jobs and even more indirect employment, new business opportunities and sustainable economic benefits that ripple across the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And maybe best of all: when the work&#8217;s all done, we’ve got something concrete to show for it.</span></p>
