(Gerville/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a truth universally acknowledged: a politician in possession of elected office must be in want of large economic development projects.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the power of this compulsion that it is proof against all reason. Certainly, it has been proof against everything critics of the data center buildout have said so far: that Virginia is catapulting itself into a costly energy crisis that will raise utility bills for residents; that the public shows no love for this industry; and that the benefits to be gained (mostly in the form of construction jobs) will continue only as long as new projects follow one another in perpetuity until the landscape is consumed by concrete and transmission wires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the credit of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC), however, it has tried to sound the alarm. JLARC’s </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt598-2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Data Centers in Virginia,” released December 9, describes the challenges facing the state as a result of the massive, ongoing buildout of this resource-intensive industry. Many of JLARC’s conclusions seem way too sanguine to me, especially around risks to regional water supplies and air pollution from diesel generators, and the policy options it offers don’t always hit the mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on the threat to Virginia’s energy supply, JLARC is blunt: Building enough infrastructure to provide electricity for even just half the data centers projected for development across the state will be difficult, requiring far more generating facilities than are under development today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the current policy of allowing completely unconstrained data center growth – indeed, subsidizing it as we do now with tax exemptions to the tune of nearly a billion dollars per year – JLARC notes we are headed for a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/09/legislative-report-development-of-data-centers-could-triple-energy-demands-if-unconstrained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tripling of the state’s electricity usage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over just the next decade and a half.  Meeting that much demand, says the report, would be “very difficult to achieve,” even if the state jettisoned the carbon emission limits imposed by the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you unfamiliar with the vocabulary of bureaucrats, “very difficult to achieve” is a term of art that translates roughly as, “This is nuts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might have been better if JLARC had employed the vernacular, because as it is, Virginia’s elected leaders will probably take “very difficult” to be a sort of heroic challenge, like beating the Russians to the moon, when what JLARC means is more like achieving lasting peace in the Middle East. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One problem is cost. The law of supply and demand dictates that a massive increase in energy demand that isn’t matched by an equally massive increase in energy supply will lead to higher prices for all customers. Yet new energy projects cost money, and under traditional ratemaking principles that also means higher rates for everyone. The result is that it will be impossible to protect residents from higher utility bills, unless changes are made to the way costs get allocated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Figuring out how to protect residents and other non-data center customers is currently a focus of the State Corporation Commission, which held a technical conference on data centers on December 16</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Judging by what the experts it convened had to say, the SCC has its work cut out for it.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if ordinary residents could be protected, the bigger problem is that increasing the supply of energy to keep up with soaring data center demand will not be easy, fast or cheap. JLARC warns that providing enough low-cost energy requires that gas plants, solar facilities, battery projects and transmission lines all be built at a pace Virginia has never achieved before, along with onshore wind farms that have never found takers here (though that may be </span><a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/big-tech-company-to-buy-power-from-va-s-first-onshore-wind-farm/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), offshore wind projects that currently lack a pathway to development, and starting ten years from now, new nuclear plants in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs) that haven’t yet achieved commercial viability.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bC6aPdPSgo"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/02/data-centers-and-virginias-special-kind-of-denialism/">Data centers and Virginia’s special kind of denialism</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Data centers and Virginia’s special kind of denialism&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/02/data-centers-and-virginias-special-kind-of-denialism/embed/#?secret=nvV1Z3JuQf#?secret=bC6aPdPSgo" data-secret="bC6aPdPSgo" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the new generation and transmission will have to overcome local opposition. On the gas side, Dominion Energy’s plans for a new plant in Chesterfield County face </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/chesterfield-community-convenes-peoples-hearing-absent-a-county-held-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fierce resistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the local community, which argues it has been burdened by fossil fuel pollution for too many years already. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean energy also struggles at the local level. Industry representatives told members of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR) on December 17 that more than 30 localities have effectively banned utility solar projects within their borders. Legislators are loath to override local government authority over permitting, even when counties that welcome data centers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turn down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the solar facilities needed to power them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, these generation projects involve willing landowners. When it comes to transmission lines that are forced on property owners through eminent domain – many of which will be needed only to carry power to data centers – the public backlash may be brutal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given so much local resistance to new generation and transmission, the fact that so many legislators nonetheless remain wedded to the data center buildout testifies to the ability of the human mind to compartmentalize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For legislators who care about climate, JLARC has more bad news: Fully half the new data center growth coming to Virginia is slated to occur in the territories of rural electric cooperatives, which are largely unaffected by VCEA limits. In addition, very large customers of Dominion and APCo have their own VCEA loophole: if they meet certain requirements, they can leave their utility to buy power from competitive service providers. Thus, if Virginia is serious about decarbonization, it will have to tighten, not loosen, the VCEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report comes with some caveats. JLARC used a team of consultants to model approaches to meeting the supply gaps, and a lot of assumptions go into the </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/presentations/JLARC%20Virginia%20Data%20Center%20Study_FINAL_12-09-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consultant’s report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without a lot of details. The consultant group says it chose its mix of resources with a view to least cost, but it acknowledges that different assumptions would change the results. It may not have accounted for the fact that renewable energy and storage prices continue to drop; meanwhile, fossil gas</span><a href="https://rmi.org/the-myth-of-stable-and-affordable-natural-gas-prices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prices are so volatile </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that the one certain  thing you can say about any price forecast is that it will be wrong. Moreover, it appears the effects of re-entering the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative were not modeled; nor were the social costs of carbon, both of which favor zero-emission sources over fossil fuel plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where there are details, some beg to be questioned. Both the consultants and JLARC take for granted that a shortage of generation in Virginia can be made up by importing electricity from other states. An easy way out, sure, but it works only if other states are producing a surplus. Unless tech companies are required to secure their own carbon-free energy supply, there is no way to guarantee imports will be available. Contrary to one of JLARC’s suggestions, then, retail choice should not be curtailed. The better move is to expand shopping options for large customers, so long as the electricity they buy is zero-carbon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more suspect is the idea that, in order to comply with the VCEA, all gas plants will convert to burning green hydrogen in 2045. The report might as well say, “and then a miracle occurs.” A miracle would be more likely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However unserious, hydrogen as a placeholder for any hoped-for technology that isn’t available today demonstrates the fundamental problem confronting Virginia’s damn-the-torpedoes approach to data centers. A refusal to put constraints on the buildout means taking a leap into the unknown and hoping something will happen to save us from the consequences of our profligacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And sure, maybe it will work out. Legislators tend to be optimists, and they are already betting on bright, shiny objects like SMRs, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/18/virginia-to-host-worlds-first-fusion-power-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fusion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and anything else not close enough for its costs and drawbacks to be fully evident. (Not that I’m immune, but personally I’m betting on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/10/geothermal-energy-is-having-a-moment-could-it-power-virginias-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced geothermal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is not just bright and shiny but </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/was-2024-a-breakout-year-for-next-generation-geothermal-energy?utm_campaign=canary&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PBgowoMiLVuB0gJvnCX8OnYRhNoz2UvuX652kq3S-jmEBgONlCzBP1Jp9a7hRErUG07g0KbCHTMz-ugwvauV_vGzK4ueJwmL6XDS0ZYvLfxlEzsA&amp;_hsmi=339495518&amp;utm_source=newsletter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) And hey, for all we know, artificial intelligence, the technology most culpable for today’s energy crisis, might even produce some unexpected new energy source.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or it might not. Given that most of the data center buildout will happen in just</span><a href="https://baxtel.com/news/will-2025-be-the-year-of-the-data-center-here-are-three-promising-facts-from-the-virginia-market" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the next five years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we might need an actual miracle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, maybe new technology will reduce the energy demand of data centers by </span><a href="https://cse.umn.edu/college/news/researchers-develop-state-art-device-make-artificial-intelligence-more-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">orders of magnitude</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That would be a fantastic outcome from the standpoint of climate, water and energy — though it would end the construction gravy train in Virginia and leave a wasteland of empty concrete warehouses and stranded energy infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, the unconstrained buildout of data centers has handed Virginia leaders a problem that is, in the parlance of JLARC, “very difficult” indeed.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Democratic leaders in the General Assembly are aligned on one thing, it’s their enthusiasm for bringing more data centers to the commonwealth. Where they part ways is in how to provide enough electricity to power them. Youngkin and most Republican legislators advocate for an “all of the above” approach that includes fossil gas as well as renewables; Democrats are committed to staying the course on the transition to zero-carbon energy, with a near-term emphasis on low-cost solar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers are making the transition harder, but so is local resistance to building solar. General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, the General Assembly is likely to consider legislation to override local solar permit denials in some cases, such as last year’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB636" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB636</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, or another approach that would break the solar logjam. It remains to be seen, however,  whether legislators will take any action on data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem has grown only more urgent as localities have continued to approve new data center proposals with little thought given to where and how they will get the power to serve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Bennett, Sierra Club Virginia’s data center chair, has been tracking data center permit applications across the state. She counts at least two dozen Virginia counties with data centers under development, including rural areas far outside the industry’s stronghold in suburban Northern Virginia. By Bennett’s calculation, data centers existing and under development in Virginia will consume at least 100,000 acres. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as local governments woo data centers, many have become hostile to solar development. A </span><a href="https://apps.dlas.virginia.gov/User_db/frmView.aspx?ViewId=6339&amp;s=7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia, which tracks solar permitting across Virginia, shows that far more local permits for solar facilities have been denied or withdrawn than were approved this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, county boards that approve data center development also reject permits for solar farms. Sometimes, it happens even at the same meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to understand this paradox, I watched footage from two county board meetings in Hanover County, one in March of this year and the other in September. At the March meeting, county supervisors </span><a href="https://www.hanovercounty.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=770" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 1,200-acre data center complex for an area north of Ashland. Later the same night, they denied a permit for a utility-scale solar project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parcels of land slated to be developed for the data center complex “included wooded areas, recently-logged areas, open fields, wetlands, ponds and stream corridors.” The developer plans to build about 30 data centers on the property, each 110 feet tall (about 10 stories), with setbacks from the property line ranging from 150 to 250 feet. The complex will require 700,000 gallons per day of cooling water. When fully developed, the data centers are expected to total a staggering 2,400 megawatts (MW) of power capacity, not far short of what </span><a href="https://dgtlinfra.com/data-centers-virginia-ashburn-loudoun/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of Loudoun County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had in 2022. There was no discussion of where so much electricity would come from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public testimony was overwhelmingly negative. The objections echoed those that have been widely reported in </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/digital-gateway-data-center-opposition-escalates-in-prince-william-county/article_61124a3a-e506-11ed-8485-a77c6d7e7ff1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to projects such as the Prince William Digital Gateway: noise, light, a massive increase in truck traffic, secrecy surrounding the project, air pollution from diesel back-up generators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the Hanover supervisors voted unanimously in favor of the project. It came down to money: the developer promised a tax benefit to the county over 20 years of $1.8 billion, plus upfront cash for road improvements and a $100,000 donation to a park. Supervisor Jeff Stoneman, who represents the Beaverdam district where the complex will be located, acknowledged his constituents’ concerns but noted that the revenue would be a “game-changer for this community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for me, as thoroughly aware as I am of all the downsides of data center sprawl, the negative impacts on communities, the risks to our water and energy security, the possibility that folks will be left with nothing but regrets – well, I just have to say: It’s really hard to argue with $1.8 billion. Rural leaders see Loudoun County </span><a href="https://www.loudounnow.com/news/business-leaders-tout-data-center-benefits-at-chamber-forum/article_f5148f4e-491f-11ef-acc5-a36d8b4e0299.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raking in revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from data centers, letting it cut taxes for everyone else. Why wouldn’t they want in on that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I noted before, though, there was no discussion of how or where the enormous amount of electricity needed to power the data centers would be generated. This disconnect was underscored later in the same meeting when the supervisors voted to reject a 20 MW solar project on 100 acres of a 315-acre site, in the same district as the data center complex they had just approved. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was especially hard to understand the denial of this particular permit. Supervisors agreed the project met all the terms of the county’s solar ordinance, including provisions for the use of native grasses and pollinator plants. Most of the property would remain untouched. The county would receive an upfront cash contribution of $438,600, in addition to the increased tax revenue from the project. The planning commission had recommended approval. No one testified against it; a number of people, including the farmer across the street, testified in its favor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the discussion of the project focused on screening the solar panels from view. Supervisors fussed that the trees to be planted at the entrance were too small, and worried that some of the existing mature trees along the road might die off over time and not be replaced. The developer agreed to put larger trees at the entrance, and even to walk the perimeter annually to monitor the health of the trees, and replace any if they needed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was no use. Two of the supervisors wanted to approve the project, but they were outvoted. Stoneman, the Beaverdam supervisor who had led the way in supporting the data center complex, said he worried that erosion might impair the creek on the property, in spite of ample natural buffers, and said he did not have a “comfort level” with the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, the county’s </span><a href="https://www.hanovercounty.gov/DocumentCenter/View/10092/Ord-23-14-Solar-Energy-Facilities" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar ordinance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adopted in 2023, was irrelevant, or at least, misleading. Such objective standards make a developer think it will be worth their while to put in months of planning, public outreach, and working with county staff. But then it turns out that what actually matters is whether a supervisor can achieve a certain undefined “comfort level.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six months after the approval of the 2,400 MW data center complex and the denial of the 20 MW solar facility, another solar project </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-09-26/hanover-county-beaverdam-solar-farm-strata-clean-energy-jeff-stoneman" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">met the same fate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, again with Stoneman making the motion to deny the permit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time the project would take up 250 acres of a 1,500-acre site and produce 72 MW of electricity, achieved through stacking the panels to a double height. Again, the project more than met the requirements of the county solar ordinance. The land was described as currently consisting of managed pine forest, already subject to being cut over at any time, and fully 70% of the property would be preserved for conservation. Native grasses would be planted, and sheep would do most of the vegetation management. The shepherd, Marcus Gray of </span><a href="https://grayslambscaping.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gray’s Lambscaping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, attended the hearing to describe the sheep operations he runs successfully at other solar sites. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approval of the project would earn the county roughly $1.7 million upfront, and $300,000 in annual tax revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supervisors praised the developer for “a really good application” that “respected” the ordinance and the environment, for the company’s willingness to listen and respond to concerns, and for agreeing to build stormwater basins and sacrifice buildable space in favor of conservation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several members of the public testified in favor of the project, but this time there were also opponents. Some of them repeated common </span><a href="https://energysolutions-solar.com/busting-renewable-energy-myths/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">myths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about solar panel toxicity and the risk of fires. One woman stated flatly, and obviously incorrectly, that it was not possible to raise sheep at a solar farm because they would die from the heat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supervisors themselves did not appear ill-informed or misinformed, though one expressed surprise that Gray could successfully sell his lamb at farmers markets when buyers knew where they had been raised. (Watching, I could only laugh, because I’ve always thought of the solar-sheep synergy as a great selling point for climate-conscious carnivores.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concern raised most often was the risk of impacts to the nearby North Anna River, though the developer had agreed to shrink the project to accommodate a much greater setback from the river than required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, however, Supervisor Stoneman’s argument for denying the permit rested on a different argument. He praised the developer for doing a good job, and noted the project was in accordance with all requirements. But, he said, “Beaverdam is just a different place.” People take pride in the rural character and forest and farmland. Our job, he noted, is to protect the trees that are harvested on the site currently, something “that is as important as the power.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Money is not the most important thing,” concluded the man who led the cheering squad for a data center complex in his district six months earlier.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two supervisors who had supported the smaller solar facility that had been rejected in March made their best arguments for this project as well, though they ultimately voted with Stoneman as the home supervisor. One said she supported solar “because I’m pro-farm,” and solar is a way to preserve farmland from development. The other noted that the land would certainly be developed one way or another, and the results would almost certainly be worse. Maintaining rural culture is important, he noted, but “we are approving residential development and seeing by-right development that people don’t want either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also warned his colleagues, as he had in the spring, that rejecting good solar projects was going to result in legislation that would take away local authority and give it to the unelected State Corporation Commission. He said he would go along with Stoneman’s motion to deny the permit because “I assume he knows something,” but he made it clear he considered it the wrong decision, and a dangerous one for local autonomy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, he had been paying attention to the conversation at the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, my sympathies lie wholeheartedly with people whose instincts are to protect the woods and fields around them. I share the one Hanover supervisor’s belief that solar is a means to preserve land from permanent development and even improve soil health and wildlife habitat, but I also understand it may be years before some people see sheep grazing under solar panels as a welcome feature in their landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I get how a rural county, having sold a little bit of its soul for $1.8 billion, might then slam the door to other development, even after applicants had worked with the county for months in good faith and done everything asked for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a choice I’d make – I’d take solar over data centers every time – but then, no one made it the county’s responsibility to contribute electricity to the grid that serves it, much less to produce the electricity needed to run the data centers it embraced.</span></p>

(Hugh Kenny)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since data centers started spreading across the Virginia landscape like an invasive pest, one important question has remained unanswered: How much does the industry’s insatiable demand for energy impact other utility customers? Under pressure from the SCC, this month Dominion Energy Virginia finally provided the answer we feared: Ordinary Virginia customers are subsidizing Big Tech with both their money and their health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion previously hid data centers among the rest of its customer base, making it impossible to figure out if residents were paying more than their fair share of the costs of building new generation and transmission lines. Worse, if data centers are the reason for burning more fossil fuels, then they are also responsible for residents being subjected to pollution that is supposed to be eliminated under the 2020 Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA). The </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-585.5/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCEA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls for most coal plants in the state to be closed by the end of this year – which is not happening – and sets rigorous conditions before utilities can build any new fossil fuel plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), filed a year and a half ago, projected steep increases in energy demand and the cost of electricity. The utility asserted that for reliability purposes it needed to keep coal plants operating, build new methane gas generating units without meeting the VCEA’s conditions, and add small nuclear reactors beginning in 2034.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="y96cnfBug6"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/28/once-again-dominions-energy-plan-falls-short-this-time-the-scc-isnt-having-it/">Once again, Dominion’s energy plan falls short.

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Once again, Dominion’s energy plan falls short.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s failure to file a plan that complied with the VCEA led to </span><a href="https://reisingergooch.com/virginia-energy-regulatory-updates-january-2024/#:~:text=SCC%20states%20that%20it%20will,56%2D585.1(A)." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an unusual stalemate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the SCC, with the IRP neither approved nor rejected. Ignoring the foul-weather warning, Dominion filed a similarly-flawed </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/820101!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024 IRP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in October.  None of the modeled scenarios showed coal plants closing, none met the energy efficiency requirements set by law, and all proposed building new gas and nuclear reactors, with the first small nuclear plant now pushed off to 2035.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither of the two filings separated out the role of data centers in driving the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before the 2024 IRP was filed, though, the SCC directed the utility to file a supplement. It was obvious the IRP would project higher costs and increased use of fossil fuels. How much of that, the SCC demanded to know, is attributable to data centers? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot, as it turns out. Though Dominion continues to obfuscate key facts, </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/82l101!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the document</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it filed on November 15 shows future data center growth will drive up utility spending by about 20%. Dominion did not take the analysis further to show the effect on residential rates. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The filing also shows that but for new data centers, peak demand would actually decrease slightly over the next few years, from 17,353 MW this year to 17,280 MW in 2027, before beginning a gentle rise to 17,818 MW in 2034 and 18,608 MW in 2039. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, without data centers, electricity use in Dominion territory would scarcely budge over the next decade. Indeed, the slight decrease over the next three years is especially interesting because near-term numbers tend to be the most reliable, with projections getting more speculative the further out you look.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprised? You’re not alone. We’ve heard for years that </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/02/virginias-electric-vehicle-transition-depends-on-the-power-grid-how-is-it-faring/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and building electrification will drive large increases in energy demand. When Dominion talks about the challenges of load growth, it cites these factors along with data centers, suggesting that ordinary people are part of the problem. We’re not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decreasing demand is a testament to the profound effect of energy efficiency, as advances in things like lighting, heat pumps and other appliances allow consumers to do more with less. Presumably, the electrification of transportation and buildings will eventually outpace gains in efficiency – no doubt reflected in the projections for slightly increasing demand over the 2030s – but the effect is still modest. Electrification is not to blame for demand growth; data centers are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a future without new data centers, there should be no reason for Virginia’s energy transition to get off track. Solar, offshore wind and battery storage could increasingly displace fossil fuels, clean our air and bring down greenhouse gas emissions at an orderly pace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least, that’s the intuitive result, though Dominion fights hard to counter it. The new filing is supposed to show what a VCEA-compliant plan would look like without data centers, but it retains assumptions from its IRPs that skew the results in favor of fossil fuels. These include limiting energy efficiency and artificially capping the amounts of solar and storage that its computer model could select. Obviously, if you won’t invest in low-cost energy efficiency and solar, you need more of something else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s computer model also doesn’t choose offshore wind in spite of the fact that the 2,600-MW Virginia Coastal Offshore Wind project is under construction. No doubt the higher cost of offshore wind is responsible for this counter-factual omission, but again, leaving it out requires that something else be selected. Nuclear similarly doesn’t make the cut due to cost.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By limiting or eliminating all zero-carbon options, Dominion would like you to conclude that, with or without data centers, it “needs” more gas plants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are other reasons to be skeptical of this manufactured result. As with the 2024 IRP itself, Dominion does not appear to have incorporated the social cost of carbon in its supposedly-VCEA-compliant plan, a mandatory consideration for any new fossil fuel generation. It’s also worth noting that Dominion will once again have to buy carbon emission allowances to run its coal and gas plants now that a court has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/20/judge-deems-youngkins-actions-to-withdraw-virginia-from-rggi-unlawful/?emci=3782c1a1-7ca7-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&amp;emdi=d50fd664-00a8-ef11-88d0-6045bdd62db6&amp;ceid=343350"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nullified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s illegal withdrawal of Virginia from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). (Youngkin has vowed to appeal.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress seem likely to overturn new EPA regulations tightening pollution standards for fossil fuel plants. That would make fossil fuels appear cheaper by shifting costs onto residents in the form of worse health outcomes and climate-related weather disasters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to showing what the energy mix might look like without data centers, the SCC directed Dominion to identify which of its approximately 200 planned transmission projects were needed solely because of data centers. The 4-page table in Dominion’s supplemental filing reveals that about half of the projects are solely data center-driven, with two or three dozen more serving a mix of customers that includes data centers. I tried to add up the numbers but lost track at a billion dollars’ worth of projects needed solely for data centers – and I was still on the second page. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is one more caveat to keep in mind. Since the SCC’s order applied only to future growth, Dominion’s new numbers don’t show the cost and energy impact of data centers in operation today. Data centers already make up a quarter of Dominion’s sales, and that growth was the main reason the utility pivoted back to fossil fuels in its 2023 IRP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, most of the data center growth lies ahead of us, as does Dominion’s plans for new fossil fuel and nuclear generation. With state leaders avidly chasing more data centers in the name of economic development, ordinary Virginians are left to watch the assault on their energy supply, their water, and their environment and wonder: Is anyone going to fix this? </span></p>

I wrote in 2016, “Reading the news Wednesday morning was like waking up from a nightmare to discover that there really </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a guy coming after you with a meat cleaver.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as I also wrote, there is only so much damage a president can do when technology, popular opinion and – especially – economics don’t support his agenda. Trump couldn’t save the coal industry (though </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/trumps-order-on-energy-promises-coal-jobs-and-a-clean-environment-what-does-that-look-like" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he tried</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Instead, his administration oversaw a </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/us-coal-jobs-down-24-from-the-start-of-trump-administration-to-latest-quarter-61386963" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">24% decline</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in coal employment. And where coal supplied 30% of U.S. electricity in 2016, by the time Trump left office it had fallen to 20%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the intervening years, Trump seems to have lost interest in coal mining, even as he continues to embrace fossil gas production. His enthusiasm for gas fracking fits with his drill-baby-drill approach to energy, but it was also intended to win over voters </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmarkind/2024/11/05/will-fracking-determine-the-next-president/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Pennsylvania</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a major producer of shale gas. Ironically, the gas industry insists on calling methane “clean” precisely because burning it emits less CO2 than coal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While coal was dying, wind and solar were well on their upswing when Trump took office in 2017, and they continued to advance through his first administration. By 2020, wind and solar had become the </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-19/wind-solar-are-cheapest-power-source-in-most-places-bnef-says" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheapest forms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of new electric generation. Today, renewable energy supplies more than 21% of the nation’s electricity, while coal’s share has dropped further, to just 16%. Trump or no Trump, technological advances and a thirst for cleaner energy continue to drive new wind and solar generation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the offshore wind industry – famously </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/13/trump-president-agenda-climate-policy-wind-power" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reviled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Trump – wasted no time this week in congratulating its erstwhile foe on his victory and </span><a href="https://www.offshore-mag.com/special-reports/news/55240984/offshore-and-energy-industry-trade-groups-comment-on-trump-victory" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insisting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, hilariously, that his election is a big win for the industry. The first Trump administration, they noted hopefully, “laid out the fundamental framework for our modern offshore wind industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, okay. From their lips to Trump’s ears. Trump is hardly known for consistency, and it is not impossible to imagine him softening his position on an industry that is creating well-paying jobs for the blue-collar workers who make up a portion of his base. His Virginia acolyte, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, boasts of overseeing the building of the nation’s largest offshore wind farm. Why shouldn’t Trump pivot? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early in the Republican primaries, one candidate </span><a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/08/24/transcript-gop-presidential-hopefuls-debate-in-milwaukee/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that all the solar panels and batteries sold in the U.S. are made in China. That wasn’t actually true. For years one U.S. company, First Solar, has ranked among the world’s top ten solar panel manufacturers. Among the domestic manufacturers of both EVs and batteries, one of the largest is Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk is now a Trump darling. It is going to be fascinating to find out whether Musk uses his influence to benefit the clean energy transition generally, or only himself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the notion that China dominates solar and battery production is also not wrong. China is eating our lunch on clean energy. Chinese companies produce </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">80% of the world’s solar panels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and more than half of its </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/4/20/are-chinese-evs-taking-over-the-car-market#:~:text=China%20accounts%20for%20more%20than,electric%20cars%20sold%20worldwide%20today." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sadly, perhaps, these are not cheap imitations of superior American products. They are world-leading technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese dominance of the world market was a major reason that President Joe Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), put so much emphasis on supporting domestic manufacturing. Tariffs on Chinese goods, Trump’s preferred approach, help U.S. companies compete for American consumers, but they don’t support an export market when other countries produce better goods for less money. Even at home, critics note, tariffs mostly just </span><a href="https://www.bushcenter.org/catalyst/opportunity-road/rooney-tariffs-rising-prices" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raise prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Trump has vowed to repeal the IRA, and given that Congress passed it without Republican support, there is certainly a danger that a Republican Congress will comply. On the other hand, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/climate/clean-energy-us-2024-election.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">observers note</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 80% of the manufacturing tax credits have gone to red states, and this August, 18 House Republicans signed a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson asking to keep the credits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t want to sound too optimistic. Wait, let me rephrase that: I don’t feel optimistic at all. We are facing headwinds today that weren’t around in 2016. At that time, gains in energy efficiency meant electricity demand was not increasing, in spite of a growing population. With wind and solar displacing coal, there was a clear pathway for CO2 emissions from the electric sector to continue falling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, however, the skyrocketing demand for electricity from data centers threatens the progress we’ve made on clean energy. It remains to be seen whether artificial intelligence will unleash efficiency gains and novel technologies that can put carbon reductions back on track. Right now, though, tech companies are so desperate for power that they will take it from wherever they can get it, and regardless of carbon content.  (I notice, though, that they still </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/11/as-virginias-scc-prepares-to-tackle-the-data-center-surge-it-can-learn-from-ohio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">want it to be cheap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and are </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/24/amazon-claims-to-power-all-its-operations-with-renewable-energy-if-only-that-were-true/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">happy to greenwash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it to meet their sustainability goals). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the biggest change from eight years ago is simply that we are that much closer to reaching catastrophic climate </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/06/earth-on-verge-of-five-catastrophic-tipping-points-scientists-warn" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tipping points</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. 2023 was the </span><a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/climate-change-indicators-reached-record-levels-2023-wmo#:~:text=The%20WMO%20report%20confirmed%20that%202023%20was,was%20the%20warmest%20ten%2Dyear%20period%20on%20record." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warmest year on record</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and 2024 is </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/climate/2024-temperatures-hottest-year.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on track</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to surpass it. The effects are evident in the number and costliness of severe weather and wildfires made worse by global warming. (Just ask </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/18/1198912918/home-insurance-rates-are-rising-due-to-climate-change-what-could-break-that-cycl" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insurance companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) It is frustrating, to say the least, to contemplate losing the next four years to an administration that thinks climate change wouldn’t be an issue if we would just stop talking about it.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Americans of all political stripes </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continue to support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> renewable energy by wide margins. And apart from a small minority of vocal climate deniers, most Americans want the U.S. to take stronger action on climate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This election revealed deep fault lines among the American public, but one thing we all have in common is the faith that our ability to solve intractable problems is stronger even than our tendency to wish the problems away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why, even in the face of such serious headwinds, the clean energy revolution will continue. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On October 15, Dominion Energy Virginia filed its <a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/-/media/pdfs/global/company/irp/2024-irp-w_o-appendices.pdf?rev=c03a36c512024003ae9606a6b6a239f3" target="_blank">2024 integrated resource plan</a> (IRP), and just as in 2023, the company shows no inclination to meet the carbon-cutting requirements of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA). Blaming soaring load growth from data centers, Dominion models only scenarios with increasing amounts of fossil fuel generation to supplement its investments in renewable energy and nuclear. A scenario that would actually comply with the law is discussed only as something stakeholders asked for, then dismissed as “infeasible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tellingly, the company notes casually that its own scenarios “evaluate the impacts of” the VCEA, as if the law were merely advisory, while the utility retained the final say. It’s kind of like a driver thoughtfully “evaluating the impact” of a speed limit – and then accelerating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, this used to work for Dominion. The State Corporation Commission (SCC) has a long history of criticizing Dominion’s IRPs and ordering the company to do better next time, but never outright rejecting a plan. If traffic cops only ever gave out warnings, you would expect to see more scofflaws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, though, the three-member SCC has two new commissioners, and already they have shown they intend to take their oversight role seriously. The commission didn’t even wait to see what Dominion would come up with before demanding improvements. On October 11, four days before Dominion submitted its IRP, the SCC issued an </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/81xf01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instructing the utility to supplement its filing with additional work, to be submitted by November 15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The task list includes modeling plans that meet the requirements of the VCEA, with at least one that incorporates data center load and one that doesn’t, as well as least-cost plans with and without data centers. In addition, the SCC wants Dominion to break down the costs of new transmission projects to identify the expenses that are primarily due to data center demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order tacitly acknowledges that the staggering growth of the data center industry in Virginia has upended utility planning. At the same time, the SCC is not giving Dominion a free pass, either on costs or on VCEA requirements. If Dominion believes it can only meet demand reliably by adding expensive gas peaker plants, it is going to have to prove it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/11/as-virginias-scc-prepares-to-tackle-the-data-center-surge-it-can-learn-from-ohio/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wrote a few weeks ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the SCC plans to convene a technical conference in December to examine issues around serving data center load. Of paramount interest to the commission are the questions of how much it will cost to meet the burgeoning demand, and how to protect other consumers from rate increases for new generation and transmission infrastructure needed only because of one industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC is not alone in its concerns about Dominion’s cavalier approach to its IRP obligations. Last year, with a goal of improving utility oversight, the General Assembly </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/05/after-six-years-of-inaction-virginia-commission-on-electric-utility-regulation-reconvenes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revitalized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its Commission on Electric Utility Regulation, which formerly served as a graveyard for utility reform bills. (CEUR used to be pronounced “sewer,” but commission members would dearly love it if you would now call it “the cure.”)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a September 16 </span><a href="https://apps.dlas.virginia.gov/User_db/frmView.aspx?ViewId=6315&amp;s=7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">memo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, CEUR director Carrie Hearne recommended members consider a list of reforms that would, among other things, require Dominion to include in its IRP “a VCEA conforming scenario that does not assume to exercise an immediate exemption due to reliability concerns.” This scenario would have to incorporate the social cost of carbon, meet energy efficiency metrics (another area where Dominion has fallen short), plan for the retirement of fossil fuel plants targeted for closure in the VCEA, and assume an “unobstructed” buildout of renewable energy and storage (removing the artificial caps Dominion currently employs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, CEUR would like Dominion to follow the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ratepayer and environmental advocates have applauded the more muscular approach being taken by CEUR and the SCC. Dominion, however, has remained steadfastly oblivious to the hints flung at it from all sides.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company remains unapologetic. In an </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/10/19/column-all-of-the-above-approach-needed-for-virginias-growing-power-demand/?share=motroiopfetoicdelaeb" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dominion Energy Chairman Bob Blue insists the company is pursuing an “all of the above” strategy that will produce electricity that is “reliable, affordable and increasingly clean” – an assertion he repeats three times, as if saying it often enough makes it true. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the IRP puts it, however, “perceptions of affordability are subjective.” Analyzing its favored scenario using the methodology directed by the SCC, Dominion projects residential bills will rise over the next 15 years from an average of $142.77 today to $315.25 in 2039. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s be charitable, though. Maybe when Mr. Blue said the company was committed to affordable energy, he meant for data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Increasingly clean” is even more counter-factual. As </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Mercury, “The utility’s previous plan projection said about 95% of electricity generation would be pulled from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/12/dominion-regulator-recommends-rejection-of-utilitys-long-term-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renewable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sources. Tuesday’s updated plan calls for about 80% of generation to be spurred by renewables.” And as with the 2023 IRP, Dominion plans to keep expensive and highly polluting coal plants operating beyond their previous retirement dates, putting the company even further away from “clean.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aj0oHhlxJS"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/">Dominion pushes for renewables, more natural gas in latest long-term plan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Dominion pushes for renewables, more natural gas in latest long-term plan&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/16/dominion-pushes-for-renewables-more-natural-gas-in-latest-long-term-plan/embed/#?secret=GkpAHJrLQI#?secret=aj0oHhlxJS" data-secret="aj0oHhlxJS" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s 2023 IRP received considerable</span><a href="https://bluevirginia.us/2023/07/dominion-energys-climate-numbers-dont-add-up" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> criticism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for projecting a doubling of greenhouse gas emissions by 2048, a year when they should be at zero under the terms of the VCEA. Dominion appears to have learned a lesson from that public shaming, but not the right lesson. The 2024 plan shortens the emissions time frame to 5 years, cutting out reporting for the later years when the proposed new methane gas plants would be in service and spewing out CO2. Instead, the IRP brags about lowering “emissions intensity,” a success it can achieve without cutting carbon, just by selling more electricity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So much for affordable and increasingly clean. As for reliable, burning more methane will only exacerbate the climate change and extreme weather that have been wreaking havoc on southeastern utilities’ ability to keep the lights on. The recent storms should be a wake-up call for utilities to ramp up renewables, including distributed solar generation and storage to serve communities, rather than building more centralized, carbon-intensive fossil fuel plants to power data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But some companies, like some people, never learn. Finding itself deep in a hole, Dominion proposes to keep on digging.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy use is skyrocketing across Virginia with the proliferation of new data centers, but as it turns out, we are not alone. Across the country, the rise of artificial intelligence and its voracious demand for power has prompted tech companies to locate new data centers wherever they think they can secure the necessary land, energy and water supplies. The result is upending utility planning everywhere. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One utility in Ohio has </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/aep-ohio-data-center-crypto-rates-puc/716150/#:~:text=Under%20AEP%20Ohio's%20proposal%2C%20data,GW%20or%20more%2C%20he%20said." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed a requirement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that data centers commit to 10-year service contracts requiring them to pay at least 90% of the cost of the electricity they ask for, regardless of whether the data centers end up using that much power.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AEP Ohio says it has received service inquiries from data centers totaling 30 gigawatts of new power demand, and that serving all those new data centers would require a massive investment in expensive transmission lines. The utility wants to ensure other ratepayers aren’t stuck with the bill if the data centers leave town, if the AI boom goes bust, or if technological breakthroughs reduce the amount of energy they need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data center industry is apoplectic, but other utilities and their regulators are watching closely to see if this is a requirement they should adopt, too. This includes Virginia’s State Corporation Commission, which on October 2 </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/getattachment/5cb8de50-1f06-4ba3-ae9e-399da0c26c10/PUR-2024-00144-Scheduling-Order-and-Notice.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a technical conference on data centers to discuss “issues related to servicing this new electrical load.” Specific topics on the agenda include minimum bills for data centers, contract term lengths and whether certain transmission and/or generation costs should be directly assigned to a new customer class consisting of large-use customers like data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conference is scheduled for December 16, and those who want to participate as panelists can nominate themselves on or before October 22. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AEP Ohio’s solution is not as novel as it might sound. It is normal for new industrial customers to be required to guarantee they will buy at least most of the electricity they say they will need. It’s a reasonable ask: a utility that spends millions of dollars on infrastructure to serve a new factory needs to make sure costs are covered if the factory folds up shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally, though, the customer has to guarantee it will buy 60-70% of the electricity it has asked for, not 90%. Tech companies complain it is unfair to require more of data centers than of other industries. If the higher number is approved, they warn, they may decide to locate in some other state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Seriously? If they were to use that talking point in Virginia, the response </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/10/virginia-sprawl-data-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> might be, “Is that a threat or a promise?”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, there are good reasons to treat data centers differently. One is the sheer scale of the energy demand involved, meaning a lot more money is at risk. AEP Ohio projects that electricity use in Central Ohio will </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/13/data-centers-power-grid-ohio/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than double</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between 2018 and 2028 due to the growth of the data center industry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another concern is that data centers operate more like warehouses than factories. It’s hard to move a factory, so it is likely to use a predictable level of electricity over a long period of time. By contrast, the contents of a warehouse (in this case, racks of servers) can be moved somewhere else if market conditions change. I </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/10/geothermal-energy-is-having-a-moment-could-it-power-virginias-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote recently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the potential of enhanced geothermal energy as a low-cost, renewable technology that is already starting to outcompete fossil fuels in western states. Utilities are right to worry about tech companies pulling out to chase cheaper, greener energy elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there is the question of whether this enormous energy demand is as real as it feels right now. Analysts have been questioning whether </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/08/07/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI might be a bubble</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If companies can’t make it profitable soon, the demand they project might evaporate, leaving a lot of data centers empty and utilities with infrastructure no one needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another, happier route to lower energy demand could be more energy-efficient operations. The data center industry as a whole has cut energy waste significantly over the years, and research suggests there may be further gains in efficiency coming. </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/opinions/the-dual-pronged-energy-saving-potential-of-quantum-computers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantum computing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is frequently cited as one tool to unlock efficiencies. More dramatically, University of Minnesota researchers recently developed hardware that </span><a href="https://cse.umn.edu/college/news/researchers-develop-state-art-device-make-artificial-intelligence-more-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can lower the energy consumption of AI applications by “a factor of 1000.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite possibly, the best  outcome for society would be for the data center boom to go bust, reducing any need for utilities to burn more fossil fuels and relieving communities of impacts on neighborhoods, parks and water resources. But utility regulators can’t wait around to see if that happens. They have to plan according to today’s expectations, which include data center demand growth of </span><a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">160% by 2030</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the response from the General Assembly, the governor, and utilities like Dominion Energy has so far amounted to nothing – or more precisely, worse than nothing. At the governor’s behest, the General Assembly actually increased tax subsidies for the wealthy industry in a bid to attract more data centers, while Dominion declared plans for expensive new fossil fuel generation and transmission to feed the demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That makes the SCC’s decision to wade in especially timely. The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission is expected to release a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data center study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the end of the year, and when it meets again in January, the General Assembly is likely to see a repeat of many of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/as-data-centers-continue-spreading-across-virginia-state-lawmakers-propose-new-development-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year’s failed bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> addressing data center efficiency, siting and ratepayer protection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the SCC can bring some sanity and cohesion to the discussion, it will be not a minute too soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, American factories have been sending their wastewater to municipal sewage treatment plants across the country, which handle it along with the effluent from other industries, homes and businesses. At the other end of the process, the separated and dried-out solids are often delivered to farmers as free fertilizer. The land application of this “sewage sludge” has long been encouraged by environmental regulators as a way to deal with what would otherwise be a vexing waste disposal problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet not all of that wastewater, or the sludge that becomes fertilizer, is benign. An increasing number of industries discharge effluent laced with toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which most treatment plants aren’t equipped to remove. PFAS are notoriously long-lasting, so much so that they are nicknamed “forever chemicals.” And now some states are finding that PFAS-laced sewage sludge is contaminating farmland and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/climate/farm-pfas-meat-poison-sewage-sludge.html?unlocked_article_code=1.MU4.49KT.7DApop-_3wl1&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poisoning consumers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PFAS are a relatively new class of synthetic chemical, </span><a href="https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/the-history-behind-forever-chemicals-pfas-3m-dupont-pfte-pfoa-pfos/698254/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emerging commercially</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 1950s to find their way into a wide range of useful products, including non-stick pans (</span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9071322/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most notoriously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Teflon), waterproof clothing, stain-resistant fabrics and firefighting chemicals. Unfortunately, exposure to PFAS has been shown to cause an almost equally-wide range of environmental and human health </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7906952/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including cancer, kidney disease, thyroid disease, reproductive problems and obesity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of foot-dragging, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finally </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/pfas-forever-chemicals-pollution-epa-superfund-2a88bfb2ae4b3bb2f0d23a0686b8e99a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">took action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against two early types of PFAS that had already fallen out of use, </span><a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2024/04/what-theyre-saying-about-epas-regulation-forever-chemicals-drinking" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">setting drinking water standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for those and a few others. At the same time, however, chemical companies have been turning out literally </span><a href="https://peer.org/commentary-epas-whack-a-mole-forever-chemicals-posture-is-an-intolerable-failure/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thousands of new iterations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have been little studied and remain largely unregulated. PFAS have become so ubiquitous in the environment that scientists estimate </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/health/pfas-testing-guidelines-wellness/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">98% of Americans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — and even some </span><a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2023/09/hs_PFAS_in_newborns_14-09-2023/story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">newborns </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">— have detectable levels in their blood.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, public health advocates have started to worry that PFAS may also be entering our food supply via the sewage sludge applied to farmland. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/31/climate/pfas-fertilizer-sludge-farm.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the New York Times, five states – Texas, Michigan, New York, Maine and Tennessee – have detected PFAS on farmland treated with sewage sludge, sometimes in high levels. Crops grown in contaminated soil absorb the chemicals and pass them up the food chain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Maine and Michigan, officials shut down farms after finding high concentrations of PFAS in the soil and in the meat of grazing animals. Maine officials </span><a href="https://www.mainepublic.org/environment-and-outdoors/2023-02-01/more-than-50-maine-farms-impacted-by-pfas-but-state-officials-see-glimmer-of-hope" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found contamination</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 56 farms and in 23% of more than 1,500 groundwater samples taken from farms and residences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Maine banned the use of sewage sludge on agricultural land and prohibited most uses of PFAS in consumer products starting in 2030. The state is now working with affected farmers to </span><a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2024/03/19/maine-pfas-fund-fields-first-farm-buyout-request/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">compensate them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or find alternative uses for contaminated land. Officials note that the testing programs are just beginning and fear that they may be seeing only the tip of the iceberg. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times did not include Virginia among the states known to have PFAS-contaminated farmland. That’s not because we don’t have a problem. Rather, it’s because the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), which issues permits to municipal wastewater treatment plants, doesn’t require sludge to be tested. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What little we do know is cause for concern. The conservation group </span><a href="https://wildvirginia.org/our-programs/preventing-pfas-pollution/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wild Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> analyzed data submitted to DEQ in 2022 by a small number of drinking water and wastewater treatment plants that voluntarily tested their effluent. Limited and incomplete as it was, the information </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlfIknLbJJs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 20 of the 21 wastewater treatment plants that tested for PFAS found significant concentrations in their effluent. Only 8 of the plants also tested their sludge, but all 8 reported significant concentrations of PFAS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked by phone with David Sligh, Wild Virginia’s c</span>onservation director <span style="font-weight: 400;">and a former DEQ employee, who told me the group plans to publish a report on this problem in the coming week. DEQ, he said, has the authority to regulate PFAS in treatment plants’ effluent and sludge and should be doing so to protect the public. His group has joined other members of the </span><a href="https://vcnva.org/agenda-item/stopping-pfas-at-its-source/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Conservation Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in calling on DEQ “to place the responsibility and cost of cleaning up PFAS on the industries that use and manufacture PFAS by requiring PFAS disclosure, monitoring, and limits in pollution discharge permits.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ, however, seems to be in no hurry. Neil Zahradka, manager of the land applications program at DEQ, wrote in an email to Tyla Matteson, a Sierra Club volunteer who works on sewage sludge issues, “To date, DEQ has relied upon the EPA biennial reviews to determine if additional regulation of biosolids is necessary beyond that contained in current permits, and no additional limits or criteria for PFAS have been set. … [A]ccording to the EPA PFAS Strategic Roadmap, they plan to complete the risk assessment for PFAS in biosolids this year.  We do plan to update the DEQ biosolids fact sheet once we have additional substantive information to offer landowners.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waiting for EPA to act first is convenient, but it does a grave disservice to Virginians. EPA itself has stalled for so long that Potomac Riverkeeper, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) and other groups finally sued the agency this year for its failure to regulate PFAS in sewage sludge used as fertilizer. </span><a href="https://peer.org/epa-flees-pfas-biosolids-contamination-crisis/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to PEER</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, EPA identified 10 different types of PFAS among some 250 pollutants contaminating sewage sludge, yet insists it is only obligated to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">identify</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the toxics in sewage sludge, not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">do anything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about it. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I suspect EPA and DEQ’s hesitance is due to the fear of what they would find in any extensive testing program. If testing confirmed widespread contamination in sewage sludge, DEQ would – one hopes – feel obligated to stop the practice of spreading it across the farms that produce our food. After all, if you identify a poison in your product, the answer is probably not to spread it among as many people as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Annoying as it would be for DEQ, industry and even farmers to learn the truth, though, the alternative is worse. PFAS </span><a href="https://cen.acs.org/environment/persistent-pollutants/Getting-PFAS-drinking-water/102/i20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">can be removed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, either in the wastewater treatment process or, ideally, before it leaves its industrial source. Not testing and treating means needlessly exposing farmers, their families and their animals – and ultimately all the rest of us – to chemicals that have no safe level of exposure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given what we know about the harms PFAS causes, DEQ’s inaction is inexcusable. If Maine can tackle this threat to its land and people, surely Virginia can do it as well. We should expect no less.</span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drill down far enough into the earth, and you will hit hot rocks. Energy companies have used this heat to generate carbon-free electricity for </span><a href="https://web.mit.edu/nature/archive/student_projects/2009/bjorn627/TheGeothermalCity/History.html#:~:text=In%201904%2C%20Prince%20Piero%20Ginori,This%20plant%20is%20still%20operating." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than a century</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s an elegant concept, but it worked only where pockets of heat lay close to the surface, accompanied by steam ready-made to turn turbines. Those limitations confined geothermal power plants to geologically active areas like Iceland, parts of Indonesia, and a few locations in the American West. As of 2023, geothermal energy made up </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/geothermal/use-of-geothermal-energy.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than half of 1%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of U.S. electricity generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, that is changing. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/02/geothermal-energy-electricity" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> derived from oil and gas fracking methods is allowing energy companies to drill deep into the earth in places far from geologic activity. Wells can reach miles beneath the surface before branching out horizontally and creating fissures in hard, hot rock. Water injected into the wells comes back to the surface as steam to generate electricity. The steam is recaptured and re-injected to take up heat again, in a virtuous cycle powered by the earth itself. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The benefits</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These “enhanced geothermal” systems can produce 24/7 baseload electricity or fill in around variable sources like wind and solar. They can even be used like batteries to store energy, including for long durations.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike drilling for fossil fuels, geothermal companies avoid the shale formations that hold hydrocarbons, instead targeting non-porous rock. And since the product is not fossil fuel but steam, the technology produces zero-carbon energy without toxic or radioactive waste. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freed from geographic limitations and using the same technology and workforce as the oil and gas industry, geothermal energy is ready to take off fast. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sees it spreading across the country to provide </span><a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/next-generation-geothermal-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as much as 125 gigawatts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (GW) of electricity by 2050. A global estimate suggests the industry could eventually produce </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261920312551#:~:text=Potential%20of%20enhanced%20geothermal%20systems,256%20GWe%20in%202050." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4,600 GW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of electricity at a cost of 50 euros (around $55) per megawatt-hour or less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022 DOE launched an “</span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earthshot Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” to reduce the cost of enhanced geothermal energy in the U.S. to $45 per megawatt-hour (MWh) by 2035. If successful, that would put it </span><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lazard-LCOE-Levelized-Cost-of-Energy-renewable-energy-version-17.png" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at or below</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the cost of any other new, dispatchable energy source. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this technology the answer to the surging demand for electricity from data centers and artificial intelligence? And could it allow Virginia to keep adding data centers without blowing up its climate goals?</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The challenges</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do have to keep in mind that not all silver bullets prove to be sterling. Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) are </span><a href="https://ieefa.org/resources/small-modular-reactors-still-too-expensive-too-slow-and-too-risky#:~:text=SMRs%20still%20are%20too%20expensive,coming%2010%20to%2015%20years." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evidence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that some highly-anticipated technologies don’t follow the rosy timelines and price projections their boosters promise. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike SMRs, though, enhanced geothermal systems have already achieved commercial deployment. After </span><a href="https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5704/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">successfully demonstrating</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the technology with a 3.5 MW pilot facility,  </span><a href="https://fervoenergy.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fervo Energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed a contract last year with </span><a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-fervo-geothermal-energy-partnership/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide electricity for its data centers from a 115-MW enhanced geothermal power plant in </span><a href="https://fervoenergy.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fervo will deliver the power to the local utility, NV Energy, which will then charge a slightly higher price to Google via a </span><a href="https://ob.nv.gov/PUC/api/Document/AUVtXfg9PCPGv6AN5IUcwlkqU2FOoopJ88kv9f6OWMnjzuFpY1bQJgc%C3%89Pfmr%C3%89og%C3%81qn0Ejg4YBd7GEPUO%C3%89aDWxjE=/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> new </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/google-fervo-nv-energy-nevada-puc-clean-energy-tariff/719472/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“clean transition tariff.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fervo has also signed a deal for an even bigger project that will deliver 400 MW to California utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a different fracking-based technology it calls a “Geopressured Geothermal System,” Houston-based </span><a href="https://www.sagegeosystems.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage Geosystems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/sage-geosystems-and-meta-sign-150mw-geothermal-power-agreement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreed to supply 150 MW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of power for Meta’s data centers beginning in 2027. Sage says it can make electricity not just by extracting heat but also by using pressure, an add-on technology that allows it to offer energy storage independent of steam production. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Fervo and Sage say their methods can be used almost anywhere, and both cite advantages over established energy sources. Like wind and solar, geothermal is renewable and carbon-free, but it isn’t dependent on weather. It also doesn’t require fuel sources like coal and gas that are highly polluting and sometimes </span><a href="https://rmi.org/reality-check-keeping-the-lights-on-in-extreme-winter-weather/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unreliable in extreme weather</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, with a small physical footprint relative to the energy produced, geothermal facilities could be located in urban areas or next to data centers and other large customers without the need for major new transmission lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, the fact that geothermal technology can be used </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/anywhere.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">anywhere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not mean it can be deployed profitably everywhere, or at least not yet. A </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/geothermal/resource-assessment-mapping.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> compiled by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory shows the most ideal areas are still in the West, where hot rocks lie within a few kilometers of the Earth’s surface. In most of the eastern U.S., deeper wells would be needed to reach the same temperatures. For this reason, DOE sees the technology proving out in the West first before spreading east.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Use in Virginia?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But favorability is not purely a function of geology, according to Ben Serrurier, manager of government affairs and policy at Fervo. I wanted to know how soon geothermal systems could start providing electricity to the world’s largest concentration of data centers, in Northern Virginia. He said the biggest impediment for the industry is not location, but the high cost of capital and the paucity of government support compared to SMRs, hydrogen, and other new technologies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of these challenges, Serrurier predicted geothermal would be deployed in Virginia by the latter part of the 2030s, noting that his company is already ahead of DOE’s projected timeline for the technology’s maturation. Eastern data centers present an especially attractive market, he said, because demand is increasing so quickly, and utilities have limited options for carbon-free energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alas, observers of the data center industry know that while renewable energy is nice to have, cheap energy is even nicer. So I wanted to talk about cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Serrurier told me Fervo’s first project will deliver power to NV Energy at a price of $107 per MWh, and Google will pay slightly more than that to the utility. That is twice DOE’s target cost for 2035, yet it still puts the price below the U.S average of 13.1 cents per kilowatt-hour ($131 per MWh) for commercial customers, and competitive with the average Nevada commercial rate of 10.92 cents, </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Energy Information Agency data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That price is, however, more than the 9.54 cents/kWh that the average commercial customer in Virginia pays for electricity derived primarily from fossil fuels. And Fervo’s price is for drilling in the West, not in the less favorable geology of the East.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But heck, anywhere in the country, 10.7 cents for zero-carbon baseload power — with no waste to be cleaned up and no added healthcare costs from pollution — still sounds compelling. Google may have chosen to be a first mover in order to show leadership and promote a new technology, but it is also locking in a solid deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sage does not make its costs public, but Lance Cook, the company’s chief technical officer, told me their process is competitive with combined cycle gas plants when the cost of fossil gas is above $6 per thousand cubic feet. (According to the Energy Information Agency, the price of gas is </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_a_EPG0_PEU_DMcf_a.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">currently</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> below that level in most states, though gas prices are famously volatile.) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional benefit, said Cook, is that a geothermal plant could be co-located with a data center, foregoing a grid connection and obviating the need for transmission lines. “We can turn electricity into data,” he told me. “It is much easier to connect data than to wait for a grid connection.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Cook and Serrurier are confident that geothermal will beat new nuclear  price-wise, which today sounds like a safe bet. </span><a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/nuclear-needs-to-be-cost-competitive-with--alternative-power-generation-to-enable-net-zero/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts warn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that cost continues to be a significant issue for the nuclear industry. </span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/levelized-cost-of-energyplus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current projections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the cost of electricity from SMRs start at $142/MWh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cook noted that Sage’s technology can also provide long-duration energy storage that isn’t dependent on the heat of the earth. This approach can be used anywhere to turn solar and wind power into baseload energy. Sage’s website claims it can achieve this for less than the cost of batteries or pumped hydro. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all this promise, enhanced geothermal has been slow to catch the attention of Virginia utilities and policy-makers. The Virginia Code includes geothermal energy in its definition of renewable energy, but enhanced geothermal is not on the list of energy sources that qualify for the state’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly did pass </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=Sb508" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year from Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, to include a similarly-named, but quite different, kind of geothermal energy – geothermal heating and cooling systems, also known as ground-source heat pumps – in the RPS. </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/geothermal-heat-pumps" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geothermal heat pumps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use the near-constant temperature of the ground just a few feet under our feet to help heat and cool buildings, much as air-source heat pumps do but with greater efficiency. A working group under the auspices of the State Corporation Commission is currently trying to figure out how to award renewable energy certificates (RECs) for a technology that does not produce electricity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But drilling down two miles or more and generating electricity at the utility level is quite another thing. Making enhanced geothermal systems eligible for the RPS would be essential to putting the technology on an even footing with other renewables for use in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an email, Surovell told me, “I have read about the Google geothermal project and believe there is significant potential in Virginia.I understand it is different, but we need to do all we can to try to meet the demand for energy created by data centers without upsetting the carbon-free goals we set with the Virginia Clean Energy Act.” He added, “Geothermal also has the potential to create thousands of well-paying trade jobs in drilling and pipefitting in the Commonwealth.”  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also contacted Dominion Energy Virginia to gauge the utility’s level of interest. Dominion is facing an enormous challenge to meet the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/28/virginia-explained-data-center-expansion-with-all-its-challenges-and-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">explosion of demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from data centers. Its </span><a href="https://cdn-dominionenergy-prd-001.azureedge.net/-/media/pdfs/global/company/2023-va-integrated-resource-plan.pdf?la=en&amp;rev=8e5047ba283b4b9bb5e17c41b3544564" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 integrated resource plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IRP) proposed building new gas plants as early as 2028 and an SMR in 2034, but no geothermal energy. The plan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/10/law-what-law-pandering-to-the-governor-dominions-new-plan-ignores-virginias-climate-law/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">failed to meet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the carbon-cutting requirements of Virginia law, so the company ought to see the need to up its game for its 2024 IRP, due in October. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s answer was not encouraging. Aaron Ruby, Dominion’s director of Virginia and offshore wind media, responded with an email that made reference to the working group for geothermal heat pump RECs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re certainly looking at the potential for geothermal in Virginia. The SCC is leading a geothermal working group, and there are lots of knowledgeable experts taking a close look. Most of the potential in Virginia appears to be geothermal heat pumps, with maybe less potential for power generation. The process is ongoing, so still more to learn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Echoing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/07/19/youngkin-speaks-about-energy-plan-ahead-of-update-in-coming-weeks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rhetoric </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on energy, he added, “As you know, we’re experiencing an unprecedented growth in power demand. Reliably serving that growth requires an ‘all of the above’ approach, including offshore wind, solar, battery storage, next generation nuclear and natural gas. Emerging technologies like clean hydrogen, longer-duration storage and geothermal could also play a role.”</span><b> </b><b> </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a great sign that Dominion ranks geothermal dead last. The company seems quite content to keep adding data centers to its customer base with no plan to meet its climate commitments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data center developers, on the other hand, could vote with their metaphorical feet. If Dominion will not bring geothermal technology to Virginia data centers, maybe the data centers will go to the geothermal technology. Why, after all, should they face public opposition and rising electricity rates in Virginia when they can go to Utah, Nevada or Texas to access low-cost, zero-carbon energy delivered 24/7 from a source that might even be located onsite? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Especially since, in so doing, they would provide the capital and demand required for enhanced geothermal to achieve DOE’s goals ahead of time, and hasten the day when Dominion presents an IRP with a real zero-carbon plan.  </span></p>

(Photo by Diane Macdonald /Stockbyte/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The human population of the Earth passed 8 billion in 2022, up from 7 billion in 2011 and less than 2 billion just a century ago. The United Nations </span><a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/world-population-day" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that by 2050, the world will hit 9.7 billion people and continue rising to 10.9 billion in 2100. The average number of children women have in their lifetimes remains above the replacement rate of 2.1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why is there so much hand-wringing about a population </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bust</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is true that population trends are uneven across the world, and some European and East Asian countries are struggling to address a decline in numbers. This is not the case in the U.S., however. Although our birth rate has been below the replacement rate for years, the Census </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/population-projections.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our population increasing by another 33 million before it peaks in 2080. By 2100, the Census expects there will still be almost 10% more people in the U.S. than there are today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly, it’s more than a little odd to worry about something that won’t happen for at least three-quarters of a century, while ignoring that in the meantime, an ever-growing population using too many resources is pushing the planet to the brink of ecological collapse. You would think we could worry about that now, and save the hysterics over population decline for the next century. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet conservatives see </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/04/28/natalism-conference-austin-00150338" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the sky falling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The fear is most palpable among white supremacists spouting </span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/replacement-theory" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">replacement theory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the notion that pale-skinned people, who are having fewer children, will be swamped by brown people, who are having more. They are pretty sure this is, in fact, a nefarious plan concocted by Jewish people, who apparently don’t count as white, with a goal of destroying Western civilization and all the great things that America stands for — by which they definitely do not mean democracy and </span><a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/blog/misogyny-powerful-undercurrent-great-replacement-conspiracy-theory-0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">civil rights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even some liberal Americans say they’re worried about the birth rate, and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/opinion/birthrate-jd-vance-progressives.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we need child tax credits, mandatory parental leave and publicly-subsidized daycare to reverse the decline. Of course, progressives support these policies anyway, so it’s hard to know how sincere their concern over birth rates really is. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not sure about the sincerity on the right, either. Most of the people who express alarm about a declining birth rate are red-state Republicans who celebrate rural living and the small-town lifestyle. They hate traffic and the plethora of rules necessary to make life tolerable in crowded communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, I guarantee you no one in New York or LA looks around and says, “You know what would make this place better? More people!”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, the pro-population-growth crowd absolutely rejects the one sure way to increase the US population: allowing more immigrants in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They say it’s not racism. Theirs is just a preference for people who look like them, sound like them and do things the way they do them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet immigration does all the things that the population alarmists say we need. It fills schools with children, bolsters the workforce, and keeps contributions flowing to Social Security and Medicare, </span><a href="https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/immigration/new-data-shows-why-the-u-s-needs-more-immigrants/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">extending the solvency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of these programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vastly more would-be immigrants are knocking at our doors than we are willing to allow in, and the numbers will only increase as climate change and the collapse of ecosystems spark further conflict and make it harder to eke out a living in more parts of the world. Countries that are able and willing to absorb the outflow of migrants from devastated areas will not be challenged by depopulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. is home to more migrants than any other country. Clearly many Americans, themselves descended from immigrants, are ready to shut the door behind them, but </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/immigration-is-fueling-us-economic-growth-while-politicians-rage?utm_medium=cpc_search&amp;utm_campaign=NB_ENG_DSAXX_DSAXXXXXXXXXX_EVG_XXXX_XXX_COUSA_EN_EN_X_BLOM_GO_SE_XXX_XXXXXXXXXX&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD9e5yp9qr7ToKv_fTO5JBlxGHqtJ&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwq_G1BhCSARIsACc7NxoW4tgy9EakvQQBctB_d2qKGME9D8UwuXrsQl3PMNrFxBbU0T-kxDwaAgTjEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">economists agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> immigration is the secret sauce of our economic strength. That doesn’t mean the doors need to be wide open, with no one managing the flow, or that we shouldn’t try to help solve the crises that drive people to leave their home countries in the first place. And we still urgently need to work on transforming our consumption-based economy into a sustainable one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it does mean we needn’t fear a population bust in our lifetimes. While other advanced countries are figuring out how to retool their economies for a shrinking population, we will always have the numbers we desire, so long as we remain a society committed to equal opportunity, democracy and the striving for justice.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, this is not what the nativist right wants. But what they want — more American-born babies and limitless population growth, achieved by controlling women’s bodies rather than by strengthening the welfare state — is a fantasy served up with a helping of bad policy. </span></p>

Amazon owns more data centers here than anyone else, and data center energy demand is driving Dominion Energy Virginia’s plan to renege on its climate commitments, keep dirty coal plants online and build expensive new gas plants and transmission lines.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, Amazon’s announcement is so full of asterisks it looks like a starry night. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with the good news. Amazon’s claim that it has purchased enough renewable energy to “match” its energy use is likely true, though its </span><a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2023-sustainability-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustainability report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> doesn’t reveal essential details like how much energy the company uses. Amazon also says it is the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world, an impressive achievement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of that renewable energy is in Virginia, so it is reasonable to say it serves the company’s data centers here. A map on Amazon’s </span><a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/climate-solutions/carbon-free-energy?energyType=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the company has invested in 19 solar farms in Virginia, with a capacity that totals around 1,386 MW  – about a quarter of all </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/virginia-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar installed in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to date. That’s terrific. If every company operating in Virginia did as much, we’d be rolling in solar, figuratively speaking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what am I complaining about? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One problem is that the energy appetite of Amazon’s data centers in Virginia far outstrips the output of all of its solar farms here. The other problem is that producing renewable energy in the middle of the day can only very loosely be said to “match” energy used at other times of the day and night. Meeting energy demand on a 24/7 basis is harder, and Amazon isn’t even trying. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with the numbers. Because the sun doesn’t shine all the time, a large solar array produces, on average, 22-25% of what it produces on a cloudless day at noon. (That percentage is known as the facility’s capacity factor.) At a 25% capacity factor, Amazon’s 1,386 MW worth of solar panels produce enough electricity to “match” about 347 MW of demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon keeps its energy demand in Virginia a secret, but we can be pretty sure its </span><a href="https://baxtel.com/data-center/virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">110 data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> here use way more than that. A 2019 </span><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/greenpeace-finds-amazon-breaking-commitment-to-power-cloud-with-100-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenpeace report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimated Amazon’s Virginia data center demand at 1,700 MW in operation or under construction, an amount that would call for 6,800 MW of solar. Amazon rejected Greenpeace’s estimate at the time, but it didn’t supply a better one. </span><a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/data-centers-virginia-amazon-environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More recent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimates suggest Amazon’s energy appetite in Virginia is on its way to 2,700 MW, enough to require the output of around 11,000 MW of solar.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily for us, Virginia is part of </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a regional transmission grid that covers all or parts of 13 states plus Washington, D.C. Generation sources located anywhere in the region can serve a Virginia customer, and Amazon’s map shows it has utility solar and wind projects in several PJM states. By my count, these add up to as much as 4,000 MW of additional renewable energy that could be allocated to Virginia data centers, if Amazon had no other operations in those states that it wanted to power. (Which, however, it does.)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding together its solar in Virginia and elsewhere in PJM still leaves Amazon short of what it likely needs. So, if the company is correct that it has secured enough renewable energy to match all of its demand, a lot of those facilities must be in other regions or other countries. Yet the climate benefit of Amazon’s solar farms in (for example) Spain, which gets </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/spains-share-electricity-generated-renewables-rose-508-2023-2023-12-19/#:~:text=MADRID%2C%20Dec%2019%20(Reuters),Teresa%20Ribera%20said%20on%20Tuesday." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 50%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its electricity from renewable energy, is significantly less than the climate benefit of solar in PJM, where the percentage of wind and solar combined still hangs in the </span><a href="https://www.monitoringanalytics.com/reports/Market_Messages/Messages/2022-som-pjm-press-release.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single digits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will – almost – give Amazon a pass on this point. PJM has been so </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-interconnection-queue-solar-battery-gas-columbia-report/715620/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appallingly slow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to approve new generation that Amazon could well have as many projects in the “queue” as online. PJM claims it will catch up in the next year and a half, and when that happens, perhaps Amazon won’t feel the need to obfuscate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Amazon were “matching” all its energy needs with wind and solar in PJM, though, it’s the second problem that troubles me more. Building solar and wind is cheap; Amazon very likely makes a profit on it. Actually ensuring renewable energy provides all the juice for the company’s operations every hour of every day, on the other hand, would require a heck of a lot of expensive energy storage. And Amazon is not doing that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without energy storage, solar delivers electricity only while the sun is shining. The rest of the time, Amazon’s data centers run on whatever resource mix the local utility uses. In both Virginia and PJM’s territory, fossil fuels make up the great majority of the mix. Building more Amazon data centers in Virginia increases the burning of fossil fuels, causing more pollution and raising costs that are borne by the rest of us. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The self-styled climate hero turns out to be a climate parasite, harming people to make itself look good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining renewable energy with storage to achieve true carbon neutrality isn’t prohibitively expensive. Other leading tech companies seem to be making that extra effort, with Google notable for its </span><a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/cleanenergy/#:~:text=Now%2C%20as%20we%20enter%20our,every%20grid%20where%20we%20operate." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commitment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to meeting its energy demand with renewable energy and storage on a 24/7 basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon’s failure to rise to this challenge explains why, in spite of its massive investments in wind and solar, the company’s carbon footprint actually</span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/10/24195707/amazons-carbon-emissions-fell-last-year" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rose by 34%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the launch of its Climate Pledge in 2019, when it set a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2040. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That explains why, a year ago, the </span><a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Based Targets initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a U.N.-backed organization that monitors corporate net-zero plans, removed Amazon from a list of companies taking action on climate goals. According to </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-08-14/amazon-carbon-emissions-climate-change#:~:text=Amazon%20is%20removed%20from%20key,up%20about%2040%25%20since%202019." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">press reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Amazon failed “to implement its commitment to set a credible target for reducing carbon emissions.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among those least impressed with the company’s efforts are its own workers. Last year, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice </span><a href="https://amazonemployees4climatejustice.medium.com/amazon-is-failing-its-own-climate-pledge-c6ff60fceccd" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accused the company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of failing in its climate commitments, and the group released its own report this month alleging </span><a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2024-07-years-amazon-climate-pledge-workers.html#:~:text=Amazon%20Employees%20for%20Climate%20Justice%20said%20in%20its%20report%20that,other%20%22dirty%22%20energy%20sources." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple climate failures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including using “creative accounting” to inflate its achievements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Virginia is serious about meeting the climate challenge, we can’t blindly accept rosy claims from corporations whose central goal is not sustainability, but growth. Data centers whose energy demand isn’t met on a 24/7 basis from zero-carbon sources located on the same grid are not part of the climate solution, they are part of the problem. And currently, Amazon’s data centers are making the problem worse.</span></p>

Artificial intelligence was in development for decades, during which time we fantasized about all the wonderful things it was going to do for us. And then the bots launched almost fully formed like Athena springing from the forehead of Zeus with her sword in hand, and only then did we have our epiphany: Oh man, this is not going to go well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happened to the AI utopia? We were expecting self-driving cars that would let us drink too much on nights out while eliminating highway fatalities. We anticipated the seamless integration of all our devices and appliances, maybe even without cords! We imagined an unlocking of efficiencies at home and at work; medical breakthroughs; scientific innovation on steroids. We’d have three-day workweeks and go hiking on the weekends while the robots cooked and cleaned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe these things are still there in our future, along with world peace, but so far what we’ve got is a new way for kids to cheat on homework, a lot of derivative art, pernicious deepfakes and raging arguments over intellectual property theft. Oh, and an unprecedented increase in the demand for electricity that threatens to overwhelm the grid and make it impossible for us to stop burning fossil fuels before global warming destabilizes societies worldwide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wonder is why we thought this would go well. Shouldn’t we have known ourselves better?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my view, the biggest problem with AI is that either humans are in charge, or the robots are. If it’s the robots, there is a good chance they will decide to kill us all, and </span><a href="https://news.berkeley.edu/2024/04/09/how-to-keep-ai-from-killing-us-all/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we won’t see it coming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So we need to root for the humans, who could use the powerful new tools of AI to address hunger and climate change but so far mostly use it for </span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/financial-services/financial-services-industry-predictions/2024/deepfake-banking-fraud-risk-on-the-rise.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial fraud</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/charlotte-child-sexual-abuse-material-case-shows-unsettling-reach-of-ai-generated-imagery" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">child pornography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and adding to the absurd percentage of the internet </span><a href="https://blog.purestorage.com/perspectives/how-much-of-the-worlds-data-is-cat-content/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">devoted to cat memes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And instead of helping to lower CO2 emissions, right now the effect of AI is to increase the burning of fossil fuels. U.S. electricity consumption had </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/13/climate/electric-power-climate-change.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flatlined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after the mid-2000s, but AI is pushing it up again, and sharply. Data centers, where AI “lives,” could consume </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/artificial-intelligence-doubles-data-center-demand-2030-EPRI/717467/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as much as 9%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of U.S. electricity generation by 2030, double that of today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a close-up view of this in Virginia, the data center capital of the world. In 2022, when I first tried to quantify Virginia’s </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/09/virginia-has-a-data-center-problem/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data center problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, industry sources put the state’s data center demand at 1,688 megawatts (MW) — equivalent to about 1.6 million homes. With the advent of AI and its enormous appetite for power, the industry added 4,000 MW of new data centers in 2023. By the end of last year, data centers </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/dominion-connected-15-data-centers-totaling-933mw-in-virginia-in-2023-15-more-expected-in-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commanded fully 24%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the total electricity generated by Dominion Energy Virginia, the state’s largest utility. Over the next 15 years, Virginia’s data center demand is expected to </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/library/reports-notices/load-forecast/2024-load-report.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quadruple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citing the need to supply data centers with power, Dominion did an about-face on its </span><a href="https://esg.dominionenergy.com/assets/pdf/2022-Climate-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. It now </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/05/03/dominion-projects-new-gas-plants-advanced-nuclear-will-be-needed-to-meet-soaring-demand/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep coal plants running past their previous retirement dates, and to build new gas-powered generation. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is not confined to Virginia. Across the country, utilities are struggling to meet AI’s increased energy demand, and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/13/climate/electric-power-climate-change.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">looking to fossil fuels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fill the gap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while tech companies talk a good game about meeting their power demand sustainably, the evidence says otherwise. Tech companies conspicuously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/16/why-are-ratepayers-footing-the-bill-for-virginias-data-center-buildout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">did not push back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Dominion Energy’s plan, and their own efforts fall woefully short. Even Google, which has taken its carbon-cutting obligations more seriously than most companies, just reported a </span><a href="https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/emissions-up-13-how-can-google-make-ai-data-sustainable" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13% rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in its greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, thanks to its investments in AI and data centers.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, Google and its competitors in the race to dominate AI think meeting climate goals is like getting a loan from a bank; you emit more today, grow your business and use the profits to clear the debt by emitting a lot less tomorrow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Mother Earth is not a bank. She is a loan shark, and she has started breaking fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we can’t rely on the inventors of AI to restrain their energy appetites, we have to turn to our politicians (sigh). Our leaders have to make and enforce limits on the growth of AI commensurate with the world’s ability to provide the resources without baking the planet. Admittedly, mustering that kind of willpower is hard to do in a country that has elevated corporations to personhood and defines the First Amendment to include both spreading lies and spending money to influence elections. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Y9aoRiEtAW"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/05/virginia-legislators-should-be-learning-all-they-can-about-ai/">Virginia legislators should be learning all they can about AI</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that gets us to the second-biggest concern I have about AI, but the one that might upend society soonest: the unleashing of deepfakes in this fall’s elections, and the threat that the reins of government will go not to those most dedicated to tackling hard problems, but to those who prove themselves the biggest scoundrels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The American Bar Association (ABA) </span><a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/leadership/office_of_the_president/american-democracy/resources/deepfakes-american-elections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">defines deepfakes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “hoax images, sounds and videos</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">that convincingly depict people saying or doing things that they did not actually say or do.” Noting that they have already been used in election campaigns in the U.S. and abroad, the ABA is promoting model state legislation to criminalize the creation of malicious deepfakes. Meanwhile, tech companies including </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-require-disclosures-digitally-altered-content-election-ads-2024-07-01/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google and Meta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have adopted advertising policies to require disclosures of altered content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both approaches are good as far as they go; websites should police content, and states should act swiftly to outlaw the deepfakes (though the ABA lists very few that have done so yet). But in a high-stakes situation like an election, punishing violators after the fact – if you can catch them at all – is very much a case of closing the barn door after the horses are out. Once voters have been exposed to “evidence” of a candidate’s unfitness for office, especially when media coverage has primed them to believe the lies, the damage is done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many voters, especially younger ones, are savvy enough to be wary of campaign-related materials generally, and of unattributed images that float around the internet in particular. But older people who came of age in the pre-internet-memes era are vulnerable to believing what they see and hear, and a lot of us won’t put ourselves to the trouble of questioning what feels true. A deepfake only has to fool some of the people some of the time to alter the results of an election.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But maybe I’m being needlessly alarmist about the dangers of AI, even if I have </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/business/artificial-intelligence-ceos-warning/index.html#:~:text=Forty%2Dtwo%20percent%20of%20CEOs,interviehttps://www.cnn.com/2023/06/14/business/artificial-intelligence-ceos-warning/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a lot of company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So I did the obvious thing: I asked a bot if AI would save humanity or kill us all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ChatGPT responded with a list of pros and cons of AI, including the familiar benefits and concerns that have spawned a thousand op-eds. You can try this at home, so I won’t reiterate them here. But I will note the curious fact that the bot didn’t mention either carbon emissions or election-altering deepfakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe that’s an oversight, or maybe it means my fears are unwarranted. But maybe it shows something even scarier than AI itself: It’s AI pretending it isn’t trying to take over.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We urgently need action from U.S. and corporate leaders. Stiff new taxes on data center energy use would lead to greater efficiencies and nudge companies to price data storage and AI use appropriately. New laws should put the onus on internet platforms to stop deepfakes before they can spread. Tech companies should prioritize what is good for human beings over what is good for corporate profit. If they can’t ensure AI is used only for good, they should pull the plug until they can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If all this doesn’t happen, and soon – well, let’s just hope the robots are kind. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin can’t run for reelection, so it’s frustrating to see him spending so much time trying to score political points. The latest episode came earlier this month, when according to </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/youngkin-calls-out-pentagons-plan-gift-china-millions-rooftop-solar-panels" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fox News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Youngkin sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin questioning the Pentagon’s plan, </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-more-104-million-advance-net-zero-projects-federal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back in January, to install solar panels on the building’s massive roof. Youngkin complained that the plan included no requirements for American-made technology, raising the question “whether American taxpayer dollars will be used to purchase solar equipment from the Chinese Communist Party.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few days later, Fox News </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-shoots-down-concerns-chinese-solar-panels" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Pentagon offered reassurance that it had a “rigorous and extensive oversight process to ensure compliance” with the Buy American Act and other laws requiring domestic content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to this second article, a Youngkin spokesperson quoted the governor as “pleased that Secretary Austin will follow his recommendations to adopt the ‘Made in America’ requirements for procuring Chinese solar panels.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Younkin’s attempt to snatch victory while still clenched in the jaws of defeat is amusing, but more than a little puzzling. Apparently Younkin is under the impression that solar panels are inherently Chinese. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s be clear: Solar energy is one of the great American </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/blog/solar-century-landmark-moments-history-solar-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">success stories</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Americans invented solar photovoltaic technology, nurtured it and led the world in its development for half a century. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">American ingenuity put solar on the path to becoming today’s </span><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low-cost leader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for power generation, to the point that it is </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-19/solar-energy-has-crossed-a-global-tipping-point-study-finds" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to become the world’s dominant source of electricity by 2050. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, as with a lot of American manufacturing, most solar panel production migrated overseas as the technology matured.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Starting in 2010, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/07/business/china-solar-energy-exports.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">China bet big</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on renewable energy, investing in solar technology itself and driving down panel prices to the point where most manufacturers in Europe and the U.S. were driven out of business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only </span><a href="https://www.firstsolar.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one U.S company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> remains in the top ten worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese companies also likely benefited from the use of </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ILAB/images/storyboards/solar/Solar.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forced labor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the production of polysilicon, the raw material for most solar panels. The U.S. </span><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2024/03/28/solar-panel-production-is-struggling-to-stay-clear-of-forced-labor/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned the importation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of solar panels made with forced labor in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By then, however, China had developed a mature supply chain and technological know-how to support low-cost production. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today China dominates every aspect of solar manufacturing, with about 80% of the world’s market share</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Chinese solar companies have expanded production capacity beyond the ability of world markets to absorb, driving down already-low prices by </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/china-solar-industry-faces-shakeout-rock-bottom-prices-persist-2024-04-03/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">42% in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Domination of the world market is only half the story, though. China also leads the world in deploying solar at home. China installed as much solar PV capacity in 2022 </span><a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/china-renewable-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as the rest of the world combined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and then </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">doubled </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that in 2023. China also leads the world in </span><a href="https://www.offshorewind.biz/2023/06/30/china-now-has-31-gw-of-offshore-wind-installed-country-on-track-to-hit-wind-and-solar-targets-five-years-early-report-says/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offshore wind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> deployment and </span><a href="https://www.drive.com.au/caradvice/which-country-has-the-most-electric-cars-in-the-world/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electric vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sales and dominates production of lithium-ion batteries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the concern that the Chinese are winning the clean energy race is well justified, and Youngkin is not the only American who hates the taste of second place. But our leaders only have two choices: stand around talking trash about the competition, or get in the game. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what Congress did in passing laws like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that support American investment in solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and other components of a green revolution. More controversially, President Joe Biden also extended Trump-era tariffs on Chinese-made polysilicon solar panels to give American manufacturers a chance to scale up. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone supports tariffs on Chinese-made solar panels, given the inflationary impact of trade barriers and the urgent need to deploy as much renewable energy as possible to lower CO2 emissions. Still, the </span><a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/news/new-study-refocuses-learning-curve" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">learning rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of solar is expected to continue </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">driving prices lower</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the long term.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One year after the IRA’s passage, a Goldman-Sachs analysis found the law was </span><a href="https://www.gsam.com/content/gsam/isl/en/advisors/market-insights/gsam-insights/perspectives/2023/us-inflation-reduction-act-is-driving-clean-energy-investment-one-year-in.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting its objectives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of driving private sector investment and job creation in the clean-tech sector, including manufacturing. This month, Wood Mackenzie </span><a href="https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/2024-press-releases/us-solar-manufacturing-capacity-increase-to-71-percent/#:~:text=News%20Release-,American%20solar%20panel%20manufacturing%20capacity%20increases%2071%25%20in%20Q1%202024,industry%20reaches%20200%2Dgigawatt%20milestone&amp;text=A%20record%2Dsetting%2011%20gigawatts,manufacturing%20growth%20in%20American%20history." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that U.S. solar manufacturing capacity increased 71% in the first quarter of 2024, making it the largest quarter of solar manufacturing growth in history. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pentagon is not known for caring about saving money, so maybe it isn’t surprising that it is only now following the example of millions of Americans by putting solar panels on the roof. Defense Department officials say the move is intended to support the resurgence in American manufacturing and to deliver the benefits of increased </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/the-pentagon-will-install-rooftop-solar-panels-as-biden-pushes-clean-energy-in-federal-buildings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy resilience and reliability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including having an uninterrupted power source in case of a cyberattack or a grid outage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low-cost, clean power, resilience and energy security are all part of the great American success story that is solar energy. A note of congratulation, not complaint, would be the better response from a governor whose state hosts the Pentagon. </span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a problem that divides communities and stymies lawmakers: Virginia’s transition to clean energy depends on building thousands of acres’ worth of large solar facilities, but a backlash from some rural neighbors makes siting projects increasingly difficult. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the objections are aesthetic – few people prefer to look at rows of solar panels if they once enjoyed a bucolic country scene – but some opponents say they worry about the loss of farmland and trees. Solar, they fear, is bad for the land as well as the eyes. It doesn’t help that some early solar development suffered from corner-cutting that resulted in soil compaction and erosion. If that is solar, many people want no part of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, land conservation groups banded together with agriculture and logging interests to lobby for </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+CHAP0688" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring mitigation whenever a solar project would disturb more than 50 acres of forest or 10 acres of “prime agricultural soils.” House Bill 206 applies to any solar project developed under Virginia’s sort-of-streamlined “permit by rule” process, which is available to all but the largest facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solar industry initially fought the legislation, joined by some climate advocacy groups. They pointed out that no other industry is subject to mitigation requirements, and that solar provides greater climate benefits than forests and agriculture. Moreover, solar panels can be removed and the land returned to farming or forestry. By contrast, once land is converted to a housing subdivision or strip mall or data center, the damage is permanent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually the solar industry accepted compromise language that put off the effective date until the start of 2025 and gave industry members a voice in an advisory panel under the auspices of Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). The law tasked this group with helping to develop “criteria to determine if a significant adverse impact to prime agricultural soils or forest lands is likely to occur as a result of a proposed solar project,” and if so, the actions that should be considered in any mitigation plan. DEQ was to use the working group’s conclusions to draw up regulations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turned out, the working group </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/20/state-work-group-on-solar-development-unable-to-reach-consensus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agreed on very little</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its 717-page report found consensus on only a few points, leaving DEQ itself with the task of resolving key issues. On May 13, the agency published its </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewXML.cfm?textid=18376" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The regulations are currently under executive branch review, after which Interested parties and the public will have the </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewStage.cfm?stageId=10341" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opportunity to comment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a few things have happened since the passage of HB 206.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March of 2022, DEQ </span><a href="https://www.williamsmullen.com/insights/news/legal-news/virginia-deq-issues-more-stringent-stormwater-management-policy-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">toughened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its stormwater regulations to address the runoff and erosion problems that had given solar a bad name in some communities. Building on that, the agency just released a new </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/our-programs/water/stormwater/stormwater-construction/handbooks" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stormwater handbook</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will become effective July 1, 2024, with sections specific to solar development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some solar industry members complain that DEQ’s stormwater regulations are unreasonably onerous, but no one questions the importance of preventing runoff and erosion. In any case, many companies are already using land-friendly practices that make it easier to meet tougher rules. One is the use of </span><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/20/tracking-the-sun-on-uneven-terrain/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">terrain following trackers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a technology that allows solar to be installed on uneven terrain instead of bringing in bulldozers to level the site. The trackers maximize solar production in hilly areas while preserving topsoil and vegetation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new tracker technology is among the suite of </span><a href="https://openei.org/wiki/InSPIRE/Primer" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low-impact approaches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gaining ground as the solar industry matures. DEQ encourages another eco-friendly practice: planting native species among and around solar arrays. Native plants provide food and habitat for insects whose numbers have plummeted in recent years, </span><a href="https://www.audubon.org/content/why-native-plants-matter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">threatening our ecosystems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Though only a few solar projects have achieved DEQ’s </span><a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/natural-heritage/pollinator-smart" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pollinator-smart certification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to date, most of the developers I’ve spoken with say they are open to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaining traction even faster is the practice of using grazing animals for vegetation management. Sheep hit the sweet spot: project owners save money they would have to spend on humans operating machinery, while the sheep thrive in the shade of solar panels and return nutrients to the soil. Already, 2% of sheep in the U.S. are being grazed under solar panels, according to an American Solar Grazing Association </span><a href="https://solargrazing.org/asga-call-76-replay-how-big-is-solar-grazing-in-the-u-s-asga-census-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">webinar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including at several large Virginia facilities providing power to Dominion Energy. Elsewhere, </span><a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/06/01/wyoming-solar-farms-also-want-cows-pigs-and-sheep-roaming-under-panels/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cattle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> graze under solar panels or </span><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/07/agrivoltaic-farming-solar-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> grow between the rows, further erasing the distinction between solar facilities and agricultural use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All-terrain trackers, topsoil preservation, native plants and incorporating active farming or grazing: all these practices ensure farmland isn’t “lost” to solar. Yet DEQ’s tougher stormwater rules, the solar industry’s increasingly land-friendly practices, and even the passage of HB 206 haven’t allayed concerns among solar opponents. Instead, rural counties have stepped up the pace of bans, caps and moratoriums. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One suspects the continued hostility isn’t because opponents lack familiarity with the ways solar can be eco-friendly, but because the opposition’s primary motivation isn’t preserving farmland. If what they really care about is keeping solar from cluttering up the viewshed (“preserving our rural heritage” is the euphemistic framing), then adding a new layer of mitigation requirements won’t change anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Admittedly, I never supported HB 206 in the first place. From an environmental perspective, solar is no worse for the land than monoculture pine plantations or commodity crops grown with pesticides and petroleum-based fertilizers. Done in a habitat-friendly way, solar can </span><a href="https://www.anl.gov/evs/article/if-you-build-it-they-will-come-how-habitatfriendly-solar-energy-can-synergize-with-biodiversity#:~:text=Solar%20facilities%20that%20provide%20habitat,which%20can%20improve%20crop%20production." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase biodiversity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and help </span><a href="https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/gateway/2023/03/ACP_Solar_and_Farmland.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heal the land</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And solar addresses our CO2 problem, far more </span><a href="https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2022/10/25/response-to-the-new-york-times-essay-are-there-better-places-to-put-large-solar-farms-than-these-forests/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even than trees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, DEQ’s job was to try to find a middle ground between the solar industry and its detractors, and in fairness, their effort gets some things right. The proposed rules recognize that there are degrees of impact a solar facility can have, and that practices like leaving topsoil undisturbed or incorporating </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/agrivoltaics-solar-and-agriculture-co-location#:~:text=Co%2Dlocation%2C%20also%20known%20as,or%20adjacent%20to%20solar%20panels." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agrivoltaics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> should be rewarded with lower mitigation requirements. A neat table delineates the various levels of impact and proposes differing levels of mitigation to match. Mitigation mostly takes the form of land set-asides, but can also be satisfied with per-acre payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet the proposal misses the mark on at least three fronts. First, it fails to give full credit to solar projects that minimize soil disturbance and incorporate agrivoltaics. DEQ should recognize that adopting best practices is itself mitigation, which should obviate the need for land set-asides or monetary payments. </span></p>

        </div>
        </a>
        
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, the proposed regulations make no exceptions for projects owned and operated by local farmers who incorporate solar into their farm activities in order to increase and diversify their income without having to sell their land. If the point of HB 206 was to protect farming, DEQ has shot wide of the mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the dollar amounts that DEQ proposes in lieu of land set-asides are punishingly high, with perverse effects. A solar company that has to pay a stiff penalty must pass that cost along in the form of a higher price for the electricity produced. If a utility has to pay more for electricity, ratepayers ultimately foot the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The alternative is equally counterproductive. I noted at the start that DEQ’s permit-by-rule process is available to all but the largest projects, but it is not the only pathway open to developers. Projects over 150 MW are required to go to the SCC for approval, but smaller projects aren’t foreclosed from doing so. If DEQ makes its own process too onerous, solar developers will go to the SCC instead. The SCC requires that a developer secure a local permit, but not that it employ soil-saving practices, agrivoltaics or mitigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be great if DEQ could turn the lemon that is HB 206 into a lemonade of a solar industry adopting eco-friendly development practices and incorporating pollinator plantings, sheep grazing, and other agrivoltaic businesses. What we have instead is a proposal that may kill the permit-by-rule program without producing any benefit to anyone – in effect, turning lemonade into lemons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is still time to get it right. DEQ may not be able to resolve the solar wars, but a good set of regulations would position Virginia to make the most of a solar industry that is essential to our future. </span></p>

In addition to creating a framework for a transition to a zero carbon electricity sector by 2050, the VCEA and sister legislation known as Solar Freedom swept away multiple barriers to installing solar in Virginia. Among the new provisions were some that strengthened net metering, the program that allows residents, businesses and local governments who install solar onsite to be credited for excess electricity they feed back to the grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-594/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires that customers of Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power be credited for the electricity they supply to the grid at the full retail rate for electricity. The credit is applied against the cost of the electricity they draw from the grid at night. The policy makes solar affordable and supports small businesses across Virginia.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the VCEA came with a ticking time bomb. It provided that in 2024 for Appalachian Power, and 2025 for Dominion, the State Corporation Commission would hold proceedings to determine the fate of net metering, and in particular the terms for compensating new net metering customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it’s 2024, and the bomb just went off. On May 6, the SCC issued an </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7z0%4001!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directing the two utilities to file their suggested changes. Appalachian’s proposal is due by September 2; Dominion’s is due by May 1, 2025. The SCC will establish a schedule for each case that will include provisions for the public and interested parties to participate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two important protections to note. First, low-income customers will have their choice of installing solar under either the existing rules or the new ones. Second, customers who install solar panels and interconnect to the grid before the SCC issues its final order will continue to be covered by the existing provisions for retail net metering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone who’s been on the fence about installing solar, I can’t overstate the urgency of acting now. Nonprofits </span><a href="https://www.solarunitedneighbors.org/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar United Neighbors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.solarizeva.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solarize Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help you get the best deal. Also check out the excellent advice and sample quotes from </span><a href="https://www.hrclimatehub.org/solar/solar-installer-comparison/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HR Climate Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make no mistake, </span><a href="https://energyandpolicy.org/edison-electric-institute-campaign-against-distributed-solar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">utilities hate net metering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and will destroy it if they can. The more customers who install solar, the less control the utility can exercise over them — and, even more critically, the </span><a href="https://ilsr.org/articles/why-utility-execs-hate-distributed-solar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the company makes for its shareholders from building new generation and transmission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not what our utilities tell legislators and the SCC, though. Instead, they promote a narrative that net metering customers impose extra costs on other ratepayers, creating a “cost shift.” The idea is that residents who go solar are making everyone else pay more of the costs of the grid while they themselves rake in money with their free electricity from the sun. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This argument has raged across the country for years. Utilities often argue that solar customers should be paid for their surplus electricity only the amount of money the utility would otherwise have had to spend to generate or buy that same amount of electricity from somewhere else. This “avoided cost” can be less than one-third of the retail rate for residential electricity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a payback period of nine to </span><a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/solar/worth-it/va" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia, residential solar is a reasonable investment with retail rate net metering, but it’s hardly a get-rich-quick scheme. Brandon Praileau, the Virginia program director for Solar United Neighbors, said in an email that lowering the net metering rate would eliminate the energy savings that homeowners see from solar today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is the full retail 1:1 value of solar that allows solar to not be a boutique purchase that only fits a certain demographic but something that every homeowner can benefit from,&#8221; he noted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Praileau added that the loss of net metering would also hit Virginia’s solar installers hard and lead to job losses, something I confirmed with industry members. Russ Edwards, president of Charlottesville-based Tiger Solar, says any devaluation of solar would have a “significantly adverse” impact on local companies like his that serve the residential market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the “cost shift” argument doesn’t actually depend on whether rooftop solar is affordable for customers or profitable for installers. The way utilities think about net metering, a homeowner could even lose money on solar and still be guilty of shifting the costs of maintaining the grid onto other customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net metering supporters counter that rooftop solar provides valuable benefits to the grid and to other customers that the utilities overlook, like relieving grid congestion and lessening the need for utility investments in new generation and transmission. Solar also has larger societal benefits like increased energy security, local resilience, clean air and carbon reduction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years this dispute has spawned literally dozens of </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/initiatives/solar-cost-benefit-studies" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimating the value of solar. A Michigan study </span><a href="https://www.mtu.edu/news/2021/02/shining-a-light-on-the-true-value-of-solar-power.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that rather than being subsidized by other ratepayers, residents who install solar actually subsidize their non-solar-owning neighbors. Closer to home, a </span><a href="https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2018/11/maryland-public-service-commission-completes-value-of-solar-report/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> study also concluded that distributed solar provided a value greater than the retail cost of energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But every state is different. California’s public utility commission recently </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/california-derailed-its-booming-rooftop-solar-buildout-can-it-be-fixed" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">slashed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the net metering rate all the way down to a so-called avoided cost, in part because the huge growth of solar in the state has led to a power glut in the middle of the day. The residential solar market cratered as a result of the PUC’s action, with an estimated 17,000 </span><a href="https://calssa.org/press-releases/2023/12/22/significant-loss-of-solar-jobs-in-every-part-of-california-following-cpuc-cuts-to-solar-incentives#:~:text=A%20survey%20of%20California%20solar,all%20solar%20jobs%20in%20California." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jobs lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the solar industry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia does not have California’s problem. With only about </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/virginia-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6.5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of our electricity generated by solar and the world’s largest energy storage facility in the form of Bath County’s </span><a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/projects-and-facilities/hydroelectric-power-facilities-and-projects/bath-county-pumped-storage-station" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pumped hydro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plant, rooftop solar still helps Virginia utilities meet peak demand. We also face a skyrocketing demand for electricity from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/03/now-what-the-heck-do-we-do-about-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which militates in favor of all the clean energy we can generate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten years ago, Virginia set out to do a study on the value of solar, led by the Department of Environmental Quality. Unfortunately, our utilities </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2014/10/06/utilities-pullout-wont-affect-value-of-solar-study/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pulled out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they didn’t like what they were seeing, so the study never progressed beyond a framing of the issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Dominion and APCo have often repeated the “cost shift” narrative but have never backed it up with evidence. Their efforts have had some effect with legislators, most recently with passage of a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1062&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instructing the SCC to “make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the net energy metering program does not result in unreasonable cost-shifting to nonparticipating electric utility customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, that simply begs the question of whether a cost shift is actually occurring. Under the VCEA, the SCC will now have to “evaluate and establish” the amount a net metering customer should pay for “the cost of using the utility’s infrastructure,” and the amount the utility should compensate the customer for the “total benefits” the customer’s solar panels provide. The SCC is also instructed to evaluate and establish the “direct and indirect economic impact of net metering” and consider “any other information the Commission deems relevant.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presumably, this other information should include the state’s </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title45.2/chapter17/section45.2-1706.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The policy specifically supports distributed solar, including “enhancing the ability of private property owners to generate their own renewable energy for their own personal use from renewable energy sources on their property.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC will now have to navigate these opposing positions in what are certain to be contentious proceedings. Meanwhile, residents and businesses would be well advised to get their solar panels up this year. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy Virginia’s answer, as described in its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), is “build more fossil fuels.” The utility is pushing forward plans to build new methane gas generating units in Chesterfield. Dominion argues that although its IRP calls for dramatically increased carbon emissions, it sort of complies with the Virginia Clean Economy Act anyway because the VCEA has an escape clause when reliability is at risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion does not acknowledge that its own actions contribute to the problem. To be fair, though, it’s a huge problem, and even if our utilities were on board with the VCEA’s carbon-cutting agenda, we would need stronger legislative policy than we have now. Rejoining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/29/yes-rggi-works/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">important priority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Democrats are rightly pursuing, but the need for action goes much further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, convened meetings the week before last to hear from utilities, industry members, environmental groups and others to get suggestions on ways to reform the VCEA. The interest groups met separately, and members of one group were not allowed to attend other group sessions to hear what those stakeholders had to say. The meetings were closed-door and confidential, with the express purpose of preventing a nosy public from learning anything  through Freedom of Information Act requests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That secrecy makes me queasy, so I declined the invitation to attend the environmentalists’ session. I’d have cheerfully jettisoned my scruples, though, if I could have been in the utility session to hear what Dominion’s lobbyists were whispering in the senator’s ear. Alas, that was not on offer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Marsden is asking the right questions, and of course, I always have answers, even when no one is asking. In my view, Virginia can stay on track to carbon neutrality by adopting four basic principles: data centers must pay their own way, both literally and carbon-wise; solar must be easy to build and interconnect; utilities must not build new fossil generation for “reliability” before exhausting non-carbon solutions; and efficient buildings must be added to the strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with the elephant outgrowing the room.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data centers are sucking up all the energy</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without action, data centers will soon overtake residential customers to become Dominion’s largest category of customer. Already, they are driving the utility’s decision-making, as we saw from Dominion’s IRP. This year, the General Assembly deferred action to address the energy crisis until it sees the results of a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being undertaken by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 2025 session, though, the General Assembly will have to choose from three options if it still cares about the energy transition: stop the growth of the data center industry in Virginia, put the onus on data centers to source their own clean energy from the grid, or dramatically increase renewable energy generation and power line construction.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers show no desire to stop all data center growth, but as </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/21/a-5-point-plan-for-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve urged before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they should establish a joint state-local task force to choose appropriate sites for growth based on energy and transmission availability, water resource adequacy and good-neighbor factors, like distance from residential communities and parkland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators should also require data centers to meet industry-best standards for energy efficiency, use alternatives to diesel generators for backup power and source carbon-free energy from facilities located on the grid that serves Virginia. They could buy this power either on their own or through a specially-designed utility tariff, as long as it meets all of their needs on a </span><a href="https://www.raponline.org/knowledge-center/24-7-carbon-free-electricity-transition-tariffs-regulatory-tool-accelerating-decarbonization-technical/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">24/7, hourly basis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In no case should other customers see higher electricity bills for infrastructure that’s only needed because of data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, these measures will take time to put in place, yet data center development is proceeding apace while the General Assembly takes its nap this year. There is no avoiding Virginia’s need for a lot more carbon-free generation, pretty much right away. A </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/07/virginia-lawmakers-pass-competing-proposals-to-encourage-small-modular-reactor-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">couple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of small modular nuclear reactors ten years from now aren’t a solution.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Don’t expect climate leadership from Dominion</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s fossil-heavy IRP marked a sharp break away from the </span><a href="https://esg.dominionenergy.com/assets/pdf/2022-Climate-Report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the company released just months before, which projected solar dominating the grid by 2040. Whether the IRP should be dismissed as political pandering to a conservative governor, or taken in earnest to mean the utility has thrown in the towel on renewable energy, is something of a Rorschach test for Virginia leaders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Dominion releases its 2024 IRP this fall, we may get more clarity about what the company really thinks. More likely, we will still be left guessing. Dominion has a long history of playing to both sides to get what it wants, and what it wants is profit.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s nothing wrong with a company making a profit, of course, as long as the company isn’t also allowed to make the rules it plays by. Asking Dominion’s lobbyists to help make energy policy is like recruiting burglars for a task force on crime prevention. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Make it easier to build solar</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia counties vie with each other to attract data centers, some are notably less keen on solar farms. Sprawling developments of windowless warehouses that suck power? Yes, they say. Grassy fields lined with rows of solar panels that produce power? No. Such is the horror with which some people view solar that localities have adopted moratoriums, acreage caps and other limits designed to keep projects at bay. The result is that an already-slow process for siting solar projects is getting even slower, more unpredictable and more expensive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers rejected legislation this year that would have allowed the State Corporation Commission to overrule local permit denials. Yet it seems </span><a href="https://greenehurlocker.com/more-virginia-counties-are-seeking-solar-moratoriums-but-are-they-legal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doubtful</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whether, in a Dillon Rule state like ours, local governments actually have the authority to enact blanket prohibitions and caps on specific kinds of land use. Legislators may want to ask the attorney general to clarify this point rather than waiting for landowners to challenge in court a locality’s refusal to let them put solar panels on their property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the AG (or a court) rules these barriers illegal, localities would have to go back to evaluating the merits of project applications on a case-by-case basis — hardly a bad result. But it would be wiser and more orderly to pass legislation spelling out under what circumstances a local government may reject a solar project, and what the landowner’s recourse should be. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">New gas plants are the wrong solution for reliability</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Dominion’s 2023 IRP didn’t win approval from the SCC, Dominion is going ahead with plans to build new methane gas combustion turbines in Chesterfield. Given that these “peaker” plants generate dirty power at a high price, Dominion should not be permitted to build gas combustion turbines if other alternatives are available. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which they are. Demand-response programs, advanced grid technologies and batteries charged by renewable energy </span><a href="https://www.cleanegroup.org/peaker-plant-reliability-must-run-designation/#:~:text=These%20alternatives%20include%20compensated%20and,lives%2C%20and%20they%20strengthen%20communities." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are superior to gas peakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for reasons of cost, air quality and climate impact. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is building some large batteries and testing long-duration battery storage technologies (and of course, Virginia already has the largest pumped storage facility in the world), but our utilities have not even begun to tap the potential of batteries in homes and businesses. Subsidizing the purchase of batteries by homeowners and businesses in exchange for the ability to draw on the batteries for peaking power, </span><a href="https://www.masssave.com/residential/rebates-and-incentives/battery-storage-and-evs/batteries#:~:text=Residents%20can%20participate%20in%20the,inverter%20will%20control%20your%20battery." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as some utilities do</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, would also build resilience into the grid and </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/09/business/energy-environment/green-mountain-home-batteries.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">address power outages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more cheaply than burying lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine: If data centers had installed batteries instead of the </span><a href="https://bristowbeat.com/stories/deq-does-not-grant-approval-for-data-centers-to-run-diesel-generators-outside-of-emergencies,37122" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11 gigawatts of diesel generators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Loudoun and Fairfax County data centers, Virginia would already have more battery storage capacity than </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1412755/electrochemical-energy-storage-capacity-worldwide-by-country/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20was%20the,capacity%20as%20of%20that%20year." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any country in the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Let everyone build solar </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VCEA calls for 35% of its solar target to be satisfied by third-party developers. The purpose of this set-aside is two-fold: to attract more private capital, and to use competition to keep a lid on prices. Unfortunately, the SCC accepted Dominion’s argument that 35% should be read as a ceiling as well as a floor, to the detriment of ratepayers and solar developers. With Dominion now reneging on its solar commitments, it’s more important than ever that private developers be allowed to step in. One </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB638" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 2024 session would have corrected this problem by explicitly making 35% the minimum. The General Assembly should adopt that measure. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fix interconnection</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possibly the most inexplicable failure of the General Assembly this year was failing to pass legislation to resolve </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/05/solar-for-schools-and-nonprofits-is-under-siege-fortunately-theres-a-simple-fix/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the dispute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between Dominion and commercial customers over interconnection requirements. The onerous requirements that Dominion adopted in December of 2022  — imposed even in the face of a contrary SCC ruling — have wreaked havoc on plans by local governments to put solar on public buildings and schools. That is fine with Dominion; though the goal of the new requirements was to acquire upgraded distribution infrastructure at no cost to itself, its monopolistic lizard brain is equally satisfied with the result of shutting down competition from small solar companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators should not accept this result, though. The General Assembly adopted net metering years ago because encouraging residents and businesses to go solar is good for the economy and makes communities more resilient. Support for distributed renewable energy is even written into the Virginia Code as </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title45.2/chapter17/section45.2-1706.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">official policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And distributed solar is hugely popular. Indeed, the very people who oppose utility-scale solar projects almost inevitably argue that society should maximize rooftop solar instead. In this they are at least half right: If we are really going to meet the energy challenge ahead of us, the very least we can do is milk every kilowatt-hour from sunshine falling on rooftops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers have always paid to interconnect their solar to the utility’s grid. The dispute between Dominion and its customers is about whether Dominion can insist they pay the entire cost of expensive new fiber-optic wire and other cool technology that could make the distribution grid better for everyone, but which any one customer can’t afford. These upgrades could enable not just more solar but also electric vehicle charging in our communities, vehicle-to-grid technology and programs allowing utilities to make use of customers’ battery storage. But if the technology really is that valuable (a determination that should be made by the SCC, not Dominion), then getting it shouldn’t depend on how deep a customer’s pocket is — especially when that customer is a local government and, therefore, effectively, the Virginia taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB117" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interconnection bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have allowed a utility to recover the costs of these grid upgrades from ratepayers, with SCC oversight. Even Dominion would have been better off with the bill, something it would have recognized if its lizard brain weren’t in charge at the time. The General Assembly should pass the bill.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">An untapped three gigawatts of energy are waiting off our coast</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s 2,600 megawatt Virginia offshore wind project is due to begin construction this year, but it is not the only game in town. The </span><a href="https://www.kittyhawkoffshore.com/documents/30600168/0/Kitty+Hawk+Wind+Fact+Sheet+March_2024.pdf/045cdac9-27a6-0b82-f46e-99d1e9840afb?t=1709785208653" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kitty Hawk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offshore wind area situated off North Carolina can deliver up to 3,500 megawatts of energy through a cable that will come ashore at Virginia Beach. All that is holding up the project is the lack of a customer.  Offshore wind is more expensive than solar, but we have a lot of power-hungry data centers who could pay a clean energy tariff that would include Kitty Hawk wind. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Maximize efficiency in buildings </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possibly the best piece of energy legislation to pass this year was the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB151" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that directs local governments and schools to build to higher efficiency standards and incorporate renewable energy, as appropriate. The language could have been even stronger, but as it is, it will deliver significant cost savings for taxpayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, local governments will now build to better standards than most homeowners get for themselves when they buy a house.  That’s because Virginia’s residential building code is pathetically </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/19/houses-can-be-built-to-use-much-less-energy-why-arent-they/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">behind the times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it comes to energy efficiency. Home buyers and renters would save more than enough money on utility bills to cover the upfront cost of better housing construction, but builders won’t voluntarily meet higher standards because it reduces profits. That should not be acceptable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation passed in 2021 directed the Board of Housing and Community Development to consider amendments that would </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2227" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strengthen the building code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. BHCD, which is dominated by builder and real estate interests, simply ignored the law. The matter is now </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FRavf8frX4tzyuHJ9qKIvFvPZtjLzGxb/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in litigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (and the governor is trying to weaken the code </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/25/as-youngkin-takes-an-axe-to-the-deep-state-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even further</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), but the General Assembly could resolve the matter by directing BHCD to adopt efficiency measures at least as strong as the national standards set by the International Building Code Council (itself under fire for allowing builder interests to weaken efficiency standards), and to allow local governments to adopt stronger “stretch codes” to help residents save even more money and energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going further, new and renovated buildings should be required to use electricity in place of methane gas, oil or propane for heating, cooling and appliances wherever practicable. Though building electrification increases electricity consumption, electricity is a more efficient technology than burning fossil fuels in the home, so it contributes to lower energy costs for residents and a smaller carbon footprint for the state overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a shame the General Assembly settled for simply not going backwards this year, but it is a good sign that Marsden and others are not waiting for next year to consider ways to get us back on the carbon-cutting wagon. With the </span><a href="https://climateclock.world/science" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate clock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ticking, we have no more time to lose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crisis is not too strong a word to describe the unchecked proliferation of power-hungry data centers in Northern Virginia and </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/business/hanover-data-center-ashland-lithium-batteries-environment/article_9d03721e-ed32-11ee-9023-ff54a278984b.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">around the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Virginia utilities do not have the energy or transmission capacity to handle the enormous increases in energy consumption. Dominion Energy projects a doubling of CO2 and a new fossil fuel buildout. Drinking water sources are imperiled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor is unfazed. Legislators are going to study the matter. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_38271" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:1127px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PJM-data-center-demand-projectsions-for-Virginia.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-38271 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PJM-data-center-demand-projectsions-for-Virginia.png" alt="" width="1127" height="693" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PJM-data-center-demand-projectsions-for-Virginia.png 1127w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PJM-data-center-demand-projectsions-for-Virginia-300x184.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PJM-data-center-demand-projectsions-for-Virginia-1024x630.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/PJM-data-center-demand-projectsions-for-Virginia-768x472.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1127px) 100vw, 1127px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Source: PJM</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to data </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/planning/res-adeq/load-forecast/load-forecast-supplement.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gathered by regional grid operator PJM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, half of the coming surge will occur in parts of Virginia served by Dominion Energy. In its </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7rwl01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Integrated Resource Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IRP), Dominion said it would meet the higher demand by increasing its use of expensive and highly polluting fossil fuels and building new methane gas-fired generating plants. Dominion admitted this will push up carbon emissions at a time when the Virginia Clean Economy Act requires the utility to build renewable energy and cut carbon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM projects equally huge data center growth in areas served by Virginia electric cooperatives, especially Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative (NOVEC). The cooperatives are exempt from most VCEA requirements, and NOVEC buys the bulk of its power from PJM’s fossil fuel-heavy wholesale market. NOVEC’s latest </span><a href="https://www.novec.com/About_NOVEC/upload/NOVEC_AR-2023-compressed-2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cites load growth of 12% per year, almost entirely from data centers, but fails to even mention the increase in carbon emissions that will accompany that growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undeterred by these alarming statistics, the General Assembly put the growth on steroids with a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/02/a-dog-a-food-fight-and-other-energy-highlights-from-the-2023-general-assembly-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new round of tax breaks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023, while beating back any conditions that might have slowed the onslaught. This year it </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/13/in-virginias-legislature-climate-progress-requires-more-than-a-democratic-majority/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned away</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every bill that would have placed limits on the industry or protected ordinary consumers from the inevitable cost increases. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, legislators rejected a host of bills that would have enabled more renewable energy development in Virginia and given customers a greater ability to secure their own electricity supply. Together these bills could have brought thousands of megawatts of new solar projects online, lowered demand growth through increased energy efficiency, and prevented the increases in carbon pollution that now appear inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators did greenlight Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power’s ability to spend their customers’ money on initial development efforts for two nuclear reactors of up to 500 megawatts (MW), one for each utility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not a fix. It is like scheduling knee surgery for next year when you are having a heart attack today.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is, famously, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/16/small-modular-nuclear-reactors-a-good-deal-for-southwest-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">much doubt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about whether small modular reactors (SMRs) will prove viable in the coming decades, but there is no doubt whatsoever that the surge in data center development is happening right now. Virginia’s hoped-for nuclear renaissance would be both too little and too late to meet a data center demand that Dominion says </span><a href="https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/25746U/20240301/NOMNP_564058.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grew by 933 MW</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023 alone. It’s expected to reach almost 20,000 MW by 2034, the year Dominion’s IRP shows its first small nuclear reactor delivering power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In rejecting every serious measure to address data center demand, General Assembly leaders said they wanted to wait for a </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> being conducted this year by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC). What the General Assembly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">didn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do was defer new data center development until the study is complete. Another year has to pass before lawmakers will even consider bills addressing land use, power and water concerns around data centers or make it easier for renewable energy to come online. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consequences of inaction could be deadly. It was only a year ago that Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) proposed allowing certain Northern Virginia data centers to violate their air quality permits by running more than 4,000 highly-polluting diesel generators during periods of grid stress. It doesn’t take much imagination to picture the public health disaster we’d have had if 4,000 diesel generators kicked into operation last summer when </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-06-09/unhealthy-air-quality-canada-wildfires-smoke-virginia-tips" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smoke from Canadian wildfires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had already made Virginia air quality hazardous.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DEQ backed off its proposal after a massive </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/28/temporary-air-pollution-exception-for-data-centers-sparks-opposition-in-northern-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public outcry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the idea is likely still percolating at the agency and might reemerge as an </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/the-dark-side-of-californias-emergency-grid-rescue-plan-more-dirty-emissions-from-backup-generators" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emergency demand-response measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even without allowing the generators to provide grid support, more data centers with more diesel generators will worsen air quality with every power outage and every round of equipment testing.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I argued </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/15/building-more-virginia-data-centers-requires-increased-pollution-controls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the diesel generator fiasco could have been avoided in the first place if data centers had been equipped with renewable energy microgrids and battery storage.  DEQ’s decision not to require battery storage as the first line of defense against power outages deprived Dominion of a demand-response option that would have been far cleaner and more useful than diesel generators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the bills the General Assembly rejected this year would have prohibited the use of backup diesel generators by data centers that receive state tax subsidies, and would have required greater energy efficiency. It was a missed opportunity that means the problem can only get worse in the coming year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor, however, could still avert the crisis by imposing a pause in data center development while the JLARC study is underway. He could accomplish this through an executive order directing the Virginia Economic Development Partnership (VEDP) not to enter a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with any data center operator until the JLARC study is complete and legislators have had the opportunity to act on it. These MOUs are a requirement for data center operators to access Virginia’s generous tax exemptions. Without the tax subsidies, most data center developers would likely choose not to pursue development here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not a novel idea. Last spring, data center reform advocates </span><a href="https://vasierra.club/LettertoVEDP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asked VEDP </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to include stringent efficiency and siting conditions in MOUs it entered with Amazon Web Services. They never got an answer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down in Georgia, however, legislators </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/georgia-senate-passes-bill-to-suspend-data-center-tax-exemptions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just passed a Republican-led bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to suspend that state’s data center tax subsidies for two years pending the results of a study of grid capacity. Legislators expressed concern about Georgia Power’s ability to provide electricity to all the data centers that want to come to the state. And as Republican Sen. John Albers also </span><a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/georgia-senate-gives-final-ok-to-suspension-of-tax-break-for-data-centers/5S365GWLDNFX7EVFG4QLTV6EIY/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “The reality is these do not create many jobs. They create big buildings, but they do not create jobs.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, the Georgia tax subsidies were modeled on the ones Virginia implemented in 2010, which pushed our data center growth into overdrive. Isn’t it interesting that Georgia lawmakers so quickly learned a lesson that Virginia leaders refuse to even acknowledge?</span></p>

It seemed possible the General Assembly might pass much-needed initiatives modest enough to avoid a veto from a Republican governor.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently not. Democrats did fend off attacks on the VCEA and Clean Cars, and killed a lot of terrible bills. Through the budget process, they’re trying to require Virginia’s renewed participation in the carbon-cutting Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. But Gov. Youngkin won’t even get his shot at most of the priority bills from the environmental community. Of the bills that did pass, most were so watered down as to make their usefulness questionable. A few bills died even when they went unopposed. Some successful bills seem likely to add to Virginia’s energy problems rather than help solve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of the blame can be laid at the feet of Dominion Energy, which took a bipartisan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/02/a-dog-a-food-fight-and-other-energy-highlights-from-the-2023-general-assembly-session/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drubbing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the 2023 session, but was back this year </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/27/in-this-arms-race-the-public-loses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stronger than ever</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like a plague that surges when we let our guard down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s only half the story. As a party, Democrats seemed to have simply lost interest in the fight. Climate change may be an urgent issue in the rest of the world, but in Virginia, a lot of lawmakers seem to think they already checked that box. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Two steps forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spirit of optimism, let’s start with the positive highlights of the session, though admittedly they were more like flashlight beams than floodlights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most consequential for the energy transition is </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB729" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> establishing a statewide green bank, a requirement for accepting hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding for clean energy projects. The House and Senate versions are different and will go to a conference committee. A show of opposition from Republicans in both chambers could attract a veto, but most governors welcome free money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, new </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB1002ER+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directs the Department of Energy to identify federal funding available to further the commonwealth’s energy efficiency goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another encouraging piece of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB151ER" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> updates and expands on existing energy efficiency requirements for new and renovated public buildings, a category that would now include schools. Provisions for EV charging capabilities, resilience measures, and onsite renewable energy and storage are included. The measure attracted only a couple of Republican votes, so it may be at risk of a veto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB313S2+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will bring sales of residential rooftop solar within the consumer protections that apply to other contractors. Virginia’s Board for Contractors will be required to issue regulations requiring relevant disclosures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The net metering law that supports customer-sited solar will now include provisions for the leasing of solar panels and the use of batteries under a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB271ER" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that is not expected to draw a veto. A solar facility paired with a battery of equal capacity will be exempt from standby charges, and the customer may use the batteries in demand-response and peak-shaving programs. Though none of the bill’s provisions were controversial, Dominion exacted a price in the form of a line directing the SCC to “make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the net energy metering program does not result in unreasonable cost-shifting to nonparticipating electric utility customers.” Our utilities hope this will undermine the current full retail value for net metered solar when the SCC considers the future of net metering in proceedings later this year and next year.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1088" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to require the Board of Education to develop materials for teaching students about climate change passed mainly along party lines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB746ER+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows, but does not require, local governments to create their own “local environmental impact funds,” to assist residents and businesses with the purchase of energy efficient lawn care and landscaping equipment, home appliances, HVAC equipment, or micro mobility devices (like electric scooters). Almost all Republicans voted against it, so modest as it is, it may draw a veto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both chambers have agreed to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+SB276ER" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the SCC form a work group to consider a program of on-bill financing for customer energy projects such as renewable energy, storage and energy efficiency improvements. The SCC will also be </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HJ30" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to study performance-based regulation and the impact of competitive service providers. Dominion will now also </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB862ER+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have to assess</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the usefulness of various grid enhancing technologies in its Integrated Resource Planning at the SCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency advocates had high hopes for a bipartisan measure they dubbed the SAVE Act to strengthen requirements for Dominion and APCo to achieve energy efficiency savings and to make it easier for efficiency programs to pass SCC scrutiny. Unfortunately, the final </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB746ER+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does almost nothing, with most improvements pushed off to 2029. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HJ6" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed that designates each October 4 as Energy Efficiency Day. (I said these were small victories.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, in a rejection of one of the more </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/25/as-youngkin-takes-an-axe-to-the-deep-state-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inane initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the governor’s regulation-gutting agenda, both Houses overwhelmingly passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+ful+HB950H1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preventing changes to the building code before the next regular code review cycle. I imagine the governor will have to veto the bill, and Republican legislators will then be caught between party loyalty and a duty to govern intelligently, but any way you look at it, eggs are meeting faces.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Two steps back </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to pass a bill might seem to leave matters where they are, with no winners or losers. Inaction in the face of climate change, however, means we lose time we can’t afford to waste.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inaction can also have devastating consequences in the here and now. Solar projects on public schools and other commercial properties in Dominion Energy’s territory have been delayed or outright canceled for more than a year due to new rules imposed by Dominion in December of 2022 that raised the cost of connecting these projects to the grid exponentially. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB117" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promoted by the solar industry and its customers would have divided responsibility for grid upgrades between the customer and the utility, while giving Dominion the ability to recover costs it incurred. Through its lobbyists’ influence on legislators, Dominion</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/21/bill-to-shift-grid-upgrade-costs-for-small-virginia-solar-projects-fails/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> killed the bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not for any compelling reason, but because it could. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s obfuscations and half-truths often work magic when the subject is technical. But of all the votes taken this year on energy bills, this one actually shocks me. No one listening to the committee testimony could have misunderstood the significance of the legislation, affecting dozens of school districts and local governments. In desperation, the solar industry offered amendments that (in my opinion) would have given away the store, to no avail. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cross-check of votes and campaign contributions shows the legislation failed due to the votes of committee members who happen to accept large campaign contributions from Dominion. This dynamic tanked a number of other climate and energy bills as well, and underlines why utilities must be barred from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/27/in-this-arms-race-the-public-loses/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">making campaign contributions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s influence also killed a priority </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB638" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the environmental community that would have required the SCC to implement the Commonwealth Energy Policy, slimmed down SCC review of efficiency programs to a single test, increased the percentage of RPS program requirements that Dominion must meet from projects of less than 1 megawatt, and increased the percentage of renewable energy projects reserved for third-party developers. Two other bills that were limited to the Commonwealth Energy Policy provision also failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s opposition was also enough to kill a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb118&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed to expand EV charging infrastructure statewide, especially in rural areas, in part by protecting gas station owners who install electric vehicle charging from competition by public utilities. Sheetz and other fuel retailers testified that they want to invest in charging infrastructure but won’t take the risk as long as Dominion can install its own chargers nearby. The reason is that using ratepayer money allows a public utility to undercut private business. Other states have dealt with this by prohibiting utilities from getting into the EV charging business. Here, the retailers asked for 12 miles between themselves and any utility-owned chargers. Dominion opposed the bill, and the fuel retailers lost in subcommittee. A second </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb107&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have created an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/04/bill-to-help-build-electric-vehicle-infrastructure-in-rural-areas-moves-along/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV rural infrastructure fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed the House but could not get funding in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills in both the House and Senate would have required most new local government buildings to include renewable energy infrastructure, especially solar. The House bill, though unopposed, was killed by Democrats in Appropriations because a fiscal impact statement erroneously said it might cost something, in spite of bill language exempting situations where the improvements would not be cost-effective. Then the same committee felt tradition-bound to kill the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb79&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it came over, although that bill carried no fiscal impact concerns and it was by then clear that killing the House bill had been a mistake. A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, but also of mindless rules. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving along: all of the bills that would have put limits on the ability of localities to bar solar projects in their jurisdictions failed, as did legislation that would have given solar developers essentially a right to appeal an adverse decision to the SCC.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the many bills supporting customer choice in electricity purchasing passed. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB644" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow localities to regulate or ban gas-powered leaf blowers also failed, as did a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB109" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have required Dominion and APCo to reveal how they voted in working groups advising grid operator PJM. This bill passed the House but, like so many others, it died in the heavily pro-utility Senate Commerce and Labor committee.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Two steps sideways?</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community solar, known as shared solar in Virginia, staggered a few steps forward, or maybe just sideways. Readers will recall that the Dominion program authorized in 2020 has proven a success only for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/11/thousands-of-low-income-virginians-set-to-get-access-to-shared-solar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low-income customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who don’t have to pay the high minimum bill Dominion secured in the SCC proceeding that followed enactment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to make the program work for the general public was the goal of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB253" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that advanced this year but may or may not help. As passed, the compromise language offers an opportunity to expand the program a little bit and to take the argument about the minimum bill back to the SCC with a different set of parameters.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to modifying the program in Dominion territory, shared solar now has a modest opening in Appalachian Power territory under a similar </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB108" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Again, the final bill offers far less than advocates hoped, and it lacks even the special provisions for low-income subscribers that make the original Dominion program work at all. Like Dominion, APCo fought the bill, though unlike Dominion, APCo’s rate base has been shrinking, so losing customers to alternative suppliers is a more legitimate concern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(At least for now. All APCo needs to do to reverse the decline is to lure a couple of data centers from up north. Data centers are such energy hogs that they would swamp any losses from shared solar, and residents of NoVa would be glad to forgo a few. Or for that matter, a few dozen.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other new measures garnered support from many in the environmental community, but don’t really move the needle. One allows geothermal heat pumps, which reduce a building’s energy demand but don’t generate electricity, to qualify under Virginia’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS). Another allows an old hydroelectric plant to qualify for the RPS, a move that adds no new renewable energy to the grid but means the electric cooperative that gets the electricity from the plant can now sell the renewable energy certificates to Dominion and APCo.</span></p>
<p><b>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Lying down and rolling over</h4>

	 </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the face of the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">single greatest threat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Virginia’s — and the nation’s — energy security and climate goals, the General Assembly’s leaders chose to do nothing. In fact, doing nothing was their actual game plan for data centers. A quick death was decreed for </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB116%27" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring data centers to meet energy efficiency and renewable energy procurement requirements as a condition of receiving state tax subsidies. Also killed were a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB191" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that sought to protect other ratepayers from bearing the costs of serving data centers, and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/15/as-data-centers-continue-spreading-across-virginia-state-lawmakers-propose-new-development-rules/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than a dozen bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dealing with siting impacts, water resources, noise abatement, undergrounding of transmission lines and other location-specific issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The excuse for inaction is that the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee is </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/resolutions/2024_Data%20centers_JLARC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">undertaking a study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to examine the energy and environmental effects of data centers. However, legislators did not impose a concomitant pause in data center development while the study is ongoing. Instead, for at least another year, Virginia’s leaders decreed that there will be no restraints or conditions on the growth of the industry, even as ever more new data center developments are </span><a href="https://www.henricocitizen.com/articles/conceptual-plan-shows-13-data-centers-on-622-acre-sandston-site/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and community opposition increases. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">And falling for the boondoggle</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuclear energy has always had its true believers at the General Assembly, and the prospect of small modular reactors (SMRs) has excited them again. Many of the same legislators who busied themselves killing climate and energy bills this year insist Virginia needs SMRs to address climate change. They are more than happy to let utilities charge ratepayers today for a nuclear plant tomorrow &#8212; or rather, ten years from now, or maybe never if things go as badly here as they did in </span><a href="https://www.facingsouth.org/2019/03/institute-index-south-pays-dearly-nuclear-industrys-failed-renaissance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Carolina</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/31/vogtle-u-s-nuclear-energy-00106597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/nuscale-cancels-first-of-a-kind-nuclear-project-as-costs-surge/#:~:text=The%20Oregon%2Dbased%20company%20and,for%20six%20small%20modular%20reactors.&amp;text=The%20country%27s%20first%20expected%20commercial,to%20the%20advanced%20nuclear%20industry." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idaho</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More cautious lawmakers say if Dominion or APCo wants to go all in on an unproven and risky technology like small modular reactors, they should shoulder the expense themselves and only then make the case for selling the power to customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has achieved a terrific success rate with boondoggles over the years. (See, e.g. its </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/03/05/the-wise-county-coal-plant-should-never-have-been-built-why-fight-to-keep-it-open/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coal plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Wise County, spending on a </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2014/03/10/2014-legislative-session-ends-with-modest-progress-on-solar-not-much-else-to-brag-about/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Anna 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reactor that was never built, and the so-called </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/10/18/dominion-attorney-general-and-scc-staff-reach-deal-in-contentious-rate-case/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rate freeze</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, followed by the also-lucrative legislation undoing the rate freeze.) By now you’d think more legislators would have joined Team Skeptic. But as always, utility donations and lobbyists’ promises are the great memory erasers. So once again, the General Assembly voted to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/07/virginia-lawmakers-pass-competing-proposals-to-encourage-small-modular-reactor-development/?emci=368f4409-0bdc-ee11-85fb-002248223794&amp;emdi=0364953a-7adc-ee11-85fb-002248223794&amp;ceid=340786"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allow ratepayer money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be spent on projects that may never come to fruition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year APCo is in on the act as well. Two bills, one for </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1491" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APCo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the other for </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB454" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will allow the utilities to charge ratepayers for initial work on nuclear plants of up to 500 MW. The final language of both bills requires SCC oversight and imposes limits on spending. That is, for now.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will the real climate champions please step forward?</h4>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This round-up might leave readers thinking there aren’t many lawmakers in Richmond who take climate change seriously. Fortunately, this is not the case. Close to two dozen legislators introduced bills targeting stronger measures on energy efficiency, renewable energy, electric vehicles and utility reform. Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, led the pack both in the sheer number of initiatives he introduced and the tenacity with which he pursued them, but he was not alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few Republicans also supported good energy legislation, and even, in the case of Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, sponsored priority bills like the SAVE Act. With groups like Energy Right and Conservatives for Clean Energy making the case from a conservative perspective, maybe we will see progress towards a bipartisan climate caucus to build on Virginia’s energy transition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that sounds too optimistic, consider that the alternative right now is the near-total inaction that marked this year’s session; we just don’t have time for that.</span></p>

Its influence appears to be greater than ever, powered by campaign donations so large that they warp what it means for legislators to serve the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As recently as 2017 </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2017/03/08/does-dominion-buy-votes-sure-but-not-the-way-you-think/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could argue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Dominion did not buy legislators. The amount of money changing hands just wasn’t enough. Former Senate Majority Leader and famous friend-of-Dominion Dick Saslaw received $57,500 over the two-year period 2015-2016. Most rank-and-file legislators got $5,000 or less. It was a lot for those days, but if a politician were going to sell their soul to a utility, you’d expect them to demand a higher price. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Dominion’s campaign contributions did buy was access for its many </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/lobbying/client/120206-dominion-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lobbyists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which led to relationships of trust, which in turn produced friendly votes. But if a legislator decided to vote against Dominion’s interest, the threat of losing a few thousand dollars in campaign cash would not have been a serious consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s harder to make this case today. The amount of money Dominion contributes to its favored politicians has reached staggering heights. According to the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP), Dominion has given out </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/120206-dominion-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than $11 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in campaign contributions so far in the 2023-2024 cycle, with the top five recipients of its largesse — three Democrats, two Republicans — each receiving at least $400,000. (As in the past, Dominion gives almost equally to Democrats and Republicans.) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPAP shows the </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/120206/recipient/338628/?start_year=2023&amp;end_year=2024&amp;recip_type=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">top recipient</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is House Majority Leader Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, whose campaign has accepted $720,000 from Dominion in this election cycle. Of this, $125,000 came in on January 5, 2024, five days before the start of the current legislative session. Legislators are not permitted to accept donations during session, presumably to avoid (or at any rate, slightly lessen) the odor of undue influence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott received a total of 12 donations from Dominion between the end of the 2023 legislative session and the opening of the 2024 session, some of them to his campaign, others to the PAC he controls, from which he doles out donations to other Democrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t mean to pick on Majority Leader Scott. Or rather, yes, I do, too, but it’s not just him. House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, reports receiving over $590,000 from Dominion since last April. Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, has accepted $465,000 this election cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Senate, the top recipient of Dominion dollars is Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, at $515,000 in 2023. Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, reports $400,000 from the utility in 2023. Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, received “only” $280,000 from Dominion, which almost makes one question the strength of the relationship. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for the skyrocketing inflation in Dominion campaign contributions can be traced to a single source: the formation of the public interest group Clean Virginia in 2018. Wealthy businessman Michael Bills formed Clean Virginia specifically </span><a href="https://www.cleanvirginia.org/about/founders-statement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to counter Dominion’s influence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The deal was that Clean Virginia would donate to campaigns only if candidates agreed not to accept money from Dominion or Appalachian Power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its first couple of years, this meant Clean Virginia donated $2,500-$5,000 to most qualifying campaigns, which was more than ordinary rank-and-file members would have gotten from Dominion in the old days. Contributions in 2018 through 2019 topped out at $12,659 for then-Sen. Chap Petersen, a well-known champion of campaign finance reform. Most, but not all, of those agreeing to eschew utility donations were Democrats, though the offer was nonpartisan. Clean Virginia’s contributions to all campaigns in 2018-2019 totaled $373,119. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills probably had no idea he was setting off a campaign finance arms race. Dominion fought back by increasing its donations to legislators who still accepted its money, causing Clean Virginia to do likewise. The nonprofit’s total contributions skyrocketed to more than $7 million over the 2021-22 cycle — but Dominion doled out over $7.6 million. In just the first year of the 2023-24 cycle, Clean Virginia’s donations totaled over $8.5 million, while Dominion’s exceeded $10.6 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Virginia has also matched Dominion in the generosity of its donations. Seven Democrats received $400,000 or more in 2023, with freshman Sen. Russet Perry, D-Loudoun, leading the pack at $593,149. Four Republicans also received Clean Virginia backing, in amounts ranging from $5,000 to $155,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where does this end? So far, at least, Dominion seems to be doubling down. In addition to increasing campaign contributions tenfold, Dominion has nearly doubled the ranks of its lobbyists, from 16 in 2017 to 31 today, at a cost of millions of dollars more. Add in the gifts its charitable arm makes to pet charities of legislators it wants to curry favor with, and all this political influence gets very expensive. Clearly, Dominion believes it makes a return on its investment in the form of favorable legislative outcomes, or it wouldn’t be doing this. (And this legislative session seems to be proving it right, as I’ll discuss in my next column.) But how long will Dominion’s shareholders be willing to keep this up?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Michael Bills seems to have dug in for the long haul. No longer content to serve as just a counterweight to utility money, Clean Virginia has expanded its own team of lobbyists and become an advocate for ratepayer interests at the General Assembly. Its donations swamp those of all other public interest groups, including the environmental groups that have traditionally battled  Dominion. But almost all of Clean Virginia’s funding comes from Bills. How long will he keep this up?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, the more money gets spent by both sides, the harder it may be to get campaign finance reform passed. The arms race may be just too lucrative for all legislators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take what happened this year with Clean Virginia’s priority </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb326&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, which would bar campaign contributions from public utilities. Dominion opposed the legislation, as it always does. Nonetheless, the bill passed out of the Privileges and Elections committee on an 8-6 vote. The vote fell along party lines, but more telling was the fact that none of those supporting the bill accept money from Dominion; all those who voted against it do.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vote should have meant clear sailing to the Senate floor, but Louise Lucas, the powerful Chair of Senate Finance (and a Democrat), insisted on the bill being re-referred to Finance, where she never put it on the docket. As a result, the rest of the Senate never voted on it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas, as noted before, accepted $400,000 from Dominion in 2023, four times as much as she received from the next largest donor, a homebuilder executive. Whether Dominion gave her so much money because of her long history of supporting the utility’s interests, or whether she supports the utility because they give her so much money, ultimately doesn’t matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all of the campaign reform bills introduced this year are </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/23/senate-bill-on-personal-use-of-campaign-cash-heads-to-house-panel-that-killed-it-before/?emci=33c74198-8dd2-ee11-85f9-002248223794&amp;emdi=a5909291-9ed4-ee11-85f9-002248223794&amp;ceid=340786"><span style="font-weight: 400;">now dead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most from the same kind of machinations that killed Roem’s bill. Sadly, it’s not just Dominion allies doing the killing. As the Mercury </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/02/13/in-virginias-democratic-legislature-campaign-finance-reform-bills-languish-without-votes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the House counterpart to Roem’s bill died when not a single one of the 22-member House Privileges and Elections Committee made a motion for or against it, including those on Clean Virginia’s good-guy list. Their inaction may well have been on orders from their leadership, but the result is that the arms race continues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However our senators and delegates justify their votes, this is bad for democracy. If a legislator can count on an easy $200,000 by taking Dominion money, or a just-as-easy $200,000 by not taking Dominion money, there’s a growing danger of small donors – of small voices  – becoming irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with the failure of election reform legislation this year, I’m afraid it will just get worse. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">building code</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Board of Housing and Community Development has been told to remove a quarter of the rules that protect homes and businesses against fires, bad weather and shoddy workmanship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Board only last summer completed its triennial </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/Docx/bhcd/book-6-final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Virginia building code, so you’d think they would have removed any unnecessary provisions already. But that’s not the point. The point is that the Axe of Freedom must fall wherever regulations gather in big bunches, and the building code is, by definition, a bunch of regulations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wasting no time, the board plans to </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewMeeting.cfm?MeetingID=39309" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on January 26 to kick off what it is calling “the reduction cycle.” Virginians will have a chance to comment, although in keeping with what I’ve found to be board practice, only the comments the board likes will count. And as the governor appoints the board members, successful opinions will be those that confirm Youngkin’s vision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From that perspective, the building code is shot full of nanny state rubbish. It dictates things like safe wiring and roofs that don’t fly off in a storm and plumbing that actually works. The governor no doubt believes we can safely trust these kinds of things to profit-maximizing corporations without state inspectors second-guessing their work. (I assume the requirement for inspections also falls to the Axe. There is nothing more nanny-state than inspections.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if the government does away with standards, won’t builders cut corners? Yes, of course they will. That is the whole point, because then they can make more money. And making money is the ultimate conservative value, second only to owning the libs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the people who wind up living in unsafe, flimsy firetraps, I expect the administration thinks it’s about time those snowflakes took personal responsibility for the quality of their homes. If they can’t correct hidden defects before a house erupts in flames or grows black mold or the basement floods, that’s on them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing advocates worry the administration might especially target energy efficiency requirements, though Lord knows the board already </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/19/houses-can-be-built-to-use-much-less-energy-why-arent-they/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">watered those down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plenty, and illegally so. But things can always get worse, and Youngkin seems committed to ensuring they do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Indeed, that would make a great tagline for Youngkin’s 25% initiative. “Glenn Youngkin: Making Virginia Government One-Quarter Worse.” Feel free to use it, governor, with my compliments.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, excising the energy efficiency section of the housing code could be a retro move to appeal to old folks’ nostalgic yearning for the days when houses were so drafty you could feel a breeze with the windows closed. Maybe you never thought we’d let new homes get built that were like those of my childhood, where the kitchen pipes froze when the temperature plunged unless you put a hot water bottle in the cupboard under the sink and left the faucet dripping. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But here we are. Will the board also remove the bans on lead paint and asbestos insulation?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The building code may be the first place to look for regulations to cut, but reaching his 25% goal will require Youngkin to take the Axe of Freedom to regulations wherever they lurk. And they lurk all over the place. Virginia’s </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincode/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">administrative code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains 24 titles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One colleague suggests simply removing every fourth word from every section of every title, which would have the virtue of wreaking havoc with the entire Deep State bureaucracy at once. And it would keep lawyers busy! Though not everyone would appreciate that feature (and sure enough, my colleague is a lawyer).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another easy option might be to just remove a quarter of the titles indiscriminately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Chopping off the last 6 of the 24 would eliminate the following: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • P</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ublic safety (creating an interesting experiment in anarchy) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • P</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ublic utilities and telecommunications (turning the management of these critical functions over to the private sector, but what could go wrong?) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecurities and retail franchising (as I have only a dim idea of what those are all about, it’s okay by me, but I expect these things have their defenders) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • S</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ocial services (this could be dicey when combined with the anarchy thing) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">axation (a popular title to jettison, with the added benefit of making the rest of government unworkable) and </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     • T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ransportation and motor vehicles (which would either allow everyone to speed to their heart’s content, or mean no one would do road repair; we’d just have to see how that went)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will object that I’m proposing a totally mindless approach to regulatory reform. On the contrary, I’m just trying to help implement the governor’s regulatory reform agenda using the same level of care and foresight he did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let the Axe of Freedom fall!</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the third year in a row, a tug-of-war is going on in the General Assembly over whether Virginia stays the course of the energy transition laid out in 2020 and 2021, or rolls it back hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats remain committed to a renewable energy future to address pollution, high electricity costs and the causes of catastrophic climate change. Gov. Glenn Youngkin and most Republican legislators cling to the familiar (dis)comfort of fossil fuels. Republicans are still lobbing grenades at the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) and the Clean Car Standard; Democrats are holding the line on those advances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year House Republicans used </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/10/04/up-for-a-vote-in-this-election-clean-energy-data-centers-and-utility-influence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">small subcommittees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to kill Democrats’ energy bills, even those that passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis. This year the Democrats’ slim majority in both chambers will let more bills get to the governor’s desk. But with the threat of a veto tempering expectations, the party of clean energy is not running big, ambitious bills, but is instead focused on solving problems that have popped up along the march to zero carbon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committees have already begun work on the hundreds of energy bills filed in past days. That’s too many for even the Mercury’s dedicated readers to review without more caffeine than is good for you, so let’s focus on just some that would have the most consequence for the clean energy transition.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">To be: Democrats work to further the clean economy</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the Democratic bills contain small fixes to existing law that add up to big gains for clean energy. One of these is </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB638" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 638</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB230" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 230</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond. Most of its provisions are tweaks to the VCEA. Among them are increasing from 1% to 5% the percentage of Dominion Energy Virginia and Appalachian Power’s renewable energy purchasing that must come from small projects like rooftop solar; streamlining the State Corporation Commission’s review of energy efficiency programs by creating a single cost-effectiveness test; and supporting competition in the development of renewable energy and energy storage facilities by specifying that “at least”35% of projects must come from third-party developers, instead of the simple 35% number currently in the law.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also contains a provision that goes beyond the VCEA. It states that the SCC has an “affirmative duty” to implement the Commonwealth Energy Policy at “lowest reasonable cost.” (Two other bills, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB137" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Fairfax, and the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB976" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Phil Hernandez, D-Norfolk, contain only this provision.) The </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title45.2/chapter17/section45.2-1705/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">energy policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is separate from the VCEA, and it </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title45.2/chapter17/section45.2-1706.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sets ambitious goals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the decarbonization of Virginia’s whole economy, including a faster timeline for achieving net zero in the electricity sector. The catch is that the policy does not have teeth, and for that reason it is routinely ignored. Requiring the SCC not just to take account of it, but also to implement it, is a step towards broader decarbonization, though it is not clear how it would actually play out at the SCC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation from Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax and Sullivan would resolve problems with the shared solar program in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB253" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion territory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (including putting restraints on the minimum bill that the utility can charge) and expand it to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB255" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power territory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB79" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 79</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, would save taxpayers money by requiring new or substantially renovated (over 50%) public buildings to have solar-ready roofs or, if solar is deemed impractical, to meet one of two high-efficiency alternatives. New or substantially renovated schools would have to be designed and built to net-zero energy standards, unless the locality determines that to be impractical or the school is a historic building. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sullivan and Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, have introduced legislation to resolve the interconnection problem that has stalled commercial solar projects across Dominion territory. The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB117" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB346" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bills specify that customers are responsible for costs on their side of the meter, while the utility pays for costs on its side, including upgrades to the distribution grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few bills seek to break through the local-level gridlock that has bedeviled utility-scale solar and wind projects. The most significant of these is </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB636" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 636</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sullivan and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB567" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 567</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, which provides an alternative permitting process for larger utility solar (50 MW or more), wind (100 MW or more) and renewable energy storage projects (at least 50 MW nameplate and discharge capacity of 200 MWh or more) that go through the local permitting process but end up without permits. Developers get a second chance at the SCC if they meet a list of requirements. These include safeguards for farmland protection, stormwater, setbacks, wetlands, wildlife corridors, etc. Applicants are also charged $75,000 to cover the locality’s cost of participating in the SCC proceeding. (There is some irony here that small projects, which have less impact, are left at the mercy of local whims, while the most impactful projects have what amounts to a right of appeal.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vehicle electrification would also get support from Democratic legislation. One bill of particular interest is Sullivan’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB118" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 118</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which requires Dominion and Appalachian Power to take charge of upgrades to the distribution grid needed to support EV charging by non-residential customers. The utilities are also tasked with filing detailed plans to “accelerate widespread transportation electrification across the Commonwealth in a manner designed to lower total ratepayer costs.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of the fate of these bills, Virginia’s efforts to transition to a zero-carbon economy will be swamped by new demand from the fast-growing </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/21/a-5-point-plan-for-data-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data center industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, unless the industry itself can be made part of the solution. A dozen or so bills seek to put conditions on the industry in one way or another, but one takes on the energy demand directly. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB116%27" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB116</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Sullivan, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB192" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB192</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Subramanyam, condition data center operators’ receipt of tax credits on demonstrating compliance with minimum standards for energy efficiency and renewable energy procurement, as well as not using diesel generators for backup power. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><b>Not to be: Republicans try out arguments against the energy transition </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the Republican anti-clean energy transition bills are blunt instruments that are more about campaigning in Trump country than low-cost energy. For example, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB397" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 397</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from freshman Del. Tim Griffin, R-Bedford, would repeal most of the important provisions of the VCEA, while declaring that development of new nuclear is “in the public interest” (a phrase that pretty much means “watch your wallet”). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, five bills seek to repeal outright the Advanced Clean Cars </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-1307.05/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed in 2021, which effectively put Virginia among the states that follow California’s path to vehicle electrification. The law does not kick in until 2025, but trying to repeal it has become a Republican standby. A more subtle </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB693" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, would condition repeal on the Virginia Automobile Dealers certifying that Virginia is not meeting its annual EV sales targets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some anti-EV bills are merely performative. One </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb387" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">non-starter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, from Griffin again, would provide a tax credit for purchases of vehicles with internal combustion engines. A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB492" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. William Stanley, R-Franklin, would require any business selling an EV or any EV component to a public body to provide a sworn declaration that there was no child labor involved not just in the manufacturing but at any point anywhere along the supply chain, starting with mining minerals abroad. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Stanley were truly concerned about child labor violations, of course, he would seek to apply this sworn declaration requirement to all industries. He could start with the domestic meatpacking industry, where child labor violations are rife, </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/migrant-child-labor-investigation-11-states-meatpacking-produce-rcna88156" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">including in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ah, if only that were the point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not just state-level decarbonization that comes in for a brute-force attack. A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1027" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from another new delegate, Eric Zehr, R-Lynchburg, makes its target any federal regulations that “may threaten the production or supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy within the Commonwealth.” If alerted to such a threat by a utility or the SCC, the Attorney General’s office would be required to intervene. This sort of bill is not intended to survive its first committee hearing, if it even gets a hearing. Its only purpose is to show off the patron’s hard right bona-fides.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be fair, there are Republicans who are actually trying to solve real problems in the energy sector. As one example, take </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB562" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB562</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell. His bill would create a ratepayer-funded pilot program for utilities to figure out a way to use coalbed methane for electricity without burning it (perhaps with fuel cells?). The problem is, he proposes to make this electricity eligible for Virginia’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS). It’s a creative, if expensive-sounding, response to the real climate problem of methane leaking from old and often abandoned coal mines, part of the true cost of coal. But calling fossil methane renewable is, shall we say, counterfactual. Some problems are more effectively tackled head-on, using tax dollars or tax credits, rather than being used to undermine the integrity of the RPS.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">To be: somewhere else entirely</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality of renewable energy is that we have to build a great many wind, solar and storage projects, each one taking months or years of design, permitting and construction work and requiring acreage we would rather use for something else. Yes, it means economic activity, investment and jobs, but it’s also something of a slog. Wouldn’t it be nice if we had a magic solution that could just provide carbon-free electricity without all that bother?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the dream that continues to attract both Democrats and Republicans to nuclear energy. Opinion is divided on whether small modular reactors (SMRs) could hold the answer to all our energy woes, or are just the latest con from an industry looking to attract a new set of deep-pocketed suckers. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZgEUNysrVU"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/16/small-modular-nuclear-reactors-a-good-deal-for-southwest-virginia/">Small modular nuclear reactors: a good deal for Southwest Virginia?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Small modular nuclear reactors: a good deal for Southwest Virginia?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/16/small-modular-nuclear-reactors-a-good-deal-for-southwest-virginia/embed/#?secret=RK5kQQ823T#?secret=ZgEUNysrVU" data-secret="ZgEUNysrVU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three things are clear at this point. One, SMRs are still many years away from commercialization, coming too late to solve the climate problem that is here and now. Second, SMRs are going to </span><a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2023/07/small-size-big-problems-nuscales-troublesome-small-modular-nuclear#:~:text=NuScale%20has%20increased%20by%2050,catastrophic%20breakdown%20and%20radiation%20leak." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cost a lot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not only is there no free nuclear lunch, there isn’t even a low-priced breakfast. And third, Dominion is frothing at the bit to build an SMR – but only if customers have to pay for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some legislators are happy to oblige, even with all these drawbacks. The most concerning of the bills are </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB1323" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB 1323</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Danny Marshall, R-Danville, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB454" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB 454</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. David Marsden, D-Fairfax. The legislation would allow Dominion or Appalachian Power to charge ratepayers “at any time” to recover development costs of a small modular nuclear reactor, defined as a nuclear reactor not larger than 500 MW. Not only is that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> small, but by the language of the bill it need not even be modular or use advanced technology. Heck, it doesn’t even have to be in Virginia. Dominion could build any kind of nuclear plant, anywhere it chooses, and satisfy the terms of the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s that “at any time” language that should be a red flag for lawmakers. Charging customers for a nuclear plant before and during construction, including cost overruns and with no guarantee of completion, is precisely how residents of South Carolina got stuck paying billions of dollars for a </span><a href="https://www.chooseenergy.com/news/article/failed-v-c-summer-nuclear-project-timeline/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hole in the ground</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That amount of money buys a lot of low-cost renewable energy and storage, right in the here and now. Virginia needs to be a clean energy state for the sake of ratepayers, the economy and the climate, and there is no time to waste.</span></p>

In good weather I carry my computer and coffee out to work from what I call my “summer office.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except on Wednesdays. On Wednesdays my neighbor’s landscaping crew descends, and then begins the racket from the lawn mowers, trimmers and, most annoyingly, leaf blowers — which somehow manages to last for hours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less predictable is the neighbor on the other side of us, who seems to be addicted to his two-stroke gas-powered leaf blower. He’s outside with it several times a week in all seasons, in spite of not having a lawn. The noise is insufferable, and even if I could tune it out, the pollution produced by the apparently-not-very-well-maintained engine forces us indoors with windows shut tight. Not satisfied with his own efforts, last spring he hired a crew of day-laborers with gas-powered leaf blowers to spend most of the workday making sure not a leaf remained anywhere on the property, including (I kid you not) in the woods behind his house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love all my neighbors, but if I could vote these machines off the planet, I would. Gas-powered leaf blowers are far and away the worst instrument of neighborly ear torture known to suburban life, and that includes pickleball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not alone in making this assessment. Local governments across the country </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90972850/why-leaf-blowers-are-being-banned-across-the-country#:~:text=Outright%20bans%20on%20the%20gas,Seattle%20in%20the%20coming%20years." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have banished them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, citing air pollution, worker health risks, harm to wildlife and contributions to global warming, as well as noise. Two years ago in Virginia, an all-volunteer advocacy group called </span><a href="https://quietcleannova.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quiet Clean NOVA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promoted a bill in the Virginia legislature that would have given localities the power to regulate or prohibit gas-powered leaf blowers. Other lawn equipment and electric leaf blowers, being much less obnoxious, were not targeted. Even drawn so narrowly, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB1337" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> died in a House subcommittee on a 5-4 vote along party lines.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qaHBV2TA0X"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/05/class-race-and-leaf-blowers/">Class, race and leaf blowers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Class, race and leaf blowers&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/10/05/class-race-and-leaf-blowers/embed/#?secret=UABk7nXUNB#?secret=qaHBV2TA0X" data-secret="qaHBV2TA0X" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Quiet Clean NOVA worked with Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Saddam Salim, D-Fairfax, on a similar </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+HB644" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> introduced in both the Virginia House and Senate. The group is planning an auditory demonstration for lawmakers: on January 11 a crew of volunteers will do our elected leaders the dubious favor of clearing detritus from the sidewalks around the Capitol using gas leaf blowers. If the engines have different power settings, we can expect them all to be set to “high.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing about leaf blowers is that owning one is not exactly part of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. When I was a child – lo these many years ago – leaves were removed from grass with a rake, and that didn’t seem to interfere with anyone’s quest for self-actualization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, in the late 1970s, California became the first state </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_blower#:~:text=The%20leaf%20blower%20originated%20in,blower%2Fmisting%20machine%20in%201955." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to embrace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> leaf blowers. It has now become the first state to ban the gas-powered version, though without an apology to the rest of us for unleashing the scourge in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I love power tools as much as the next homeowner. I’ve learned that a relaxed approach to leaves is better for </span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/leaf-litter-fall-conservation#:~:text=A%202023%20study%20suggests%20leaf,of%20decomposition%20to%20produce%20soil." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wildlife and soil health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but a few times per year I bring out my electric leaf blower, connect it to an extension cord, and blow the accumulated leaves and debris off our roof. I do the same for our gravel driveway in the fall. The electric blower is about as loud as a vacuum cleaner, produces no fumes, and has never needed repair in the 20 years I’ve owned it. Should I ever need a new one, they sell for under a hundred bucks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be a bit much to expect landscaping crews to run around tethered to extension cords, but that is where advances in battery technology come in. Battery-powered leaf blowers cost about as much as gas-powered blowers, but they are cleaner, quieter, easier to maintain and </span><a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/home-garden/leaf-blowers/gas-vs-electric-leaf-blower-which-is-better-a6168456021/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more reliable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Not to mention, the sound </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/11/05/leaf-blowers-fall-environment-health/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t penetrate walls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and drive the neighbors batty. The catch is that a battery may need recharging before a big job is complete (or for my neighbor, before every leaf is out of the woods). A landscaping crew would need to carry spare batteries, which adds to the cost.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents of legislation letting localities regulate gas blowers will argue that it isn’t fair to landscapers to make them invest in new equipment before the old equipment has reached the end of its useful life. A locality would have to weigh that consideration against the more diffuse, but much greater, costs to society imposed by the current use of gas blowers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s an argument about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">whether</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to regulate. That discussion should be had at the level of government that operates closest to neighborhoods and people, at city councils and boards of supervisors. Quiet Clean NOVA’s bill gives those localities the ability to regulate but does not require them to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia’s General Assembly, though, even a modest bill may get caught up in the political moment. Few Virginia Republicans represent densely-populated districts where noise and pollution are serious issues. Most are blessed to represent quieter rural areas. It’s easy for some of them to frame any local regulation as an infringement on personal liberty. Still, I question whether any of these gentlefolk, when settling in for a pleasant spell on the porch, greet the sudden roaring of a leaf blower by exclaiming, “Ah! The sound of freedom!” I think they say the same unprintable things I do.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I get the slippery slope argument. If you let communities decide for themselves whether to regulate things that harm people’s health and the environment, next thing you know they might start trying to control how people live their lives in private, possibly even banning things like drag queen story hours and </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/19/lgbtq-community-people-of-color-in-the-crosshairs-of-banned-book-movement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">library books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Black people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, wait. We’re there already, aren’t we?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So maybe let’s just look at this legislation as simply what it is: a way to give our local elected officials the right to hear the voices of their distressed constituents, crying out for a little peace and quiet.</span></p>

Targeting development in </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/Docx/oz/oz-fact-sheet.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qualified Opportunity Zones</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Norfolk Solar installed solar at the historic Wesley Union AME Zion church in Norfolk, the Southside Boys and Girls Club, a Habitat for Humanity ReStore, and other nonprofits. To increase the local benefits, Amundsen and Cleanthes required installers to hire local, low-income and typically minority workers. All told, the company did $2 million in business between 2019 and 2022, while creating jobs for local residents in the clean energy economy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, it all came to a screeching halt. Last December, Dominion Energy Virginia unilaterally imposed new – and prohibitively expensive – interconnection requirements for most commercial solar. A solar array seeking interconnection approval this year faces total project costs that are </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/11/21/solar-developers-continue-to-fight-dominions-solar-interconnection-rules/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 to 40%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  higher than they were last year under the old rules. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Norfolk Solar had hundreds of thousands of dollars of investor money committed to new projects, Cleanthes told me they were forced to break contracts and turn away funders. The company has not done a single project in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonprofits are not the only victims of Dominion’s move. Plans to put solar on schools and municipal buildings have ground to a halt all across Dominion territory. A community solar project that would have served low-income residents </span><a href="https://energynews.us/2022/12/12/utilitys-interconnection-demands-stall-virginia-community-solar-project/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had to be scuttled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last December when Dominion demanded the developer install a high-speed fiber optic line that would have increased project costs by 50%.</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Solar developers continue to fight Dominion&#8217;s solar interconnection rules&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/21/solar-developers-continue-to-fight-dominions-solar-interconnection-rules/embed/#?secret=011Q29IZ5o#?secret=0QVmqdynG5" data-secret="0QVmqdynG5" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion says its requirements are about safety and reliability. Solar developers challenge that, noting that the equipment they install already meets industry standards, and that other utilities don’t demand the upgrades Dominion wants. They suspect Dominion is trying to offload onto solar customers the cost of grid improvements that Dominion will use for other purposes, and in so doing to crush the small competitors it has battled with for years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The details of the dispute are, to put it mildly, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/26/solar-developers-ask-regulators-to-suspend-dominion-interconnection-rules/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly technical</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the impacts are readily discernible in the near-collapse of Virginia’s commercial solar market. Most noticeably, solar school projects have stalled out across Dominion’s service territory. Schools that were counting on using solar panels to lower their energy costs have been forced to cancel plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cathy Lin, energy manager for Arlington Public Schools, told me she was shocked when the county’s solar developer told her about the increased costs, which she considers exorbitant. “We want to put on more solar,” she said. “We can’t afford to. The extra interconnection fees make solar unaffordable for us.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://vasolaralliance.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed Solar Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (of which I am a co-founder as a solar advocate) has spent much of this year fighting Dominion at the State Corporation Commission. The SCC </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/regulators-order-dominion-to-suspend-costly-solar-interconnect-requirements/article_dfdfe16e-4763-11ee-9230-5bc41f9214be.html#:~:text=Fiber%20connections%20for%20communication%20between,of%20upgrades%20at%20a%20substation." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruled in the DSA’s favor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on all points in August, but in November an SCC hearing examiner unexpectedly authorized Dominion to impose many of the same requirements on an “interim” basis – with no end in sight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking off my advocacy hat for a moment, I actually have some sympathy for the hearing examiner. If a utility tells you it has to have the latest in fiber-optic technology and fancy-pants equipment as a matter of safety and reliability, you’d better have a pretty deep understanding of grid technology before you say no. Lacking the requisite expertise, how surprised can we be that this guy basically punted?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the results are terrible for an entire sector of Virginia’s economy. The ruling is bad for developers like Norfolk Solar, which will not be able to continue its mission to bring solar and job training to low-income areas. It’s bad for schools, universities and other customers, who can’t afford to complete long-planned projects that were supposed to bring energy savings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And though the fight at the SCC is specific to net-metered solar projects between 250 kilowatts and 3 megawatts, allowing Dominion to impose requirements without demonstrating that they’re actually needed has dire implications for all distributed generation up and down the scale – and, logically, even for distributed battery storage and EV charging. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really, this result is not even great for Dominion, because relying on a single customer to fund an expensive substation or line upgrade will usually result in no upgrade happening. That’s no way to run a grid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately, there is a way to resolve this matter without risking safety and reliability, while at the same time reinvigorating the distributed generation market and allowing stalled solar projects to move forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly could simply clarify that solar developers are responsible for safety equipment and other costs of interconnection </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the premises</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">off site </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">improvements – including new fiber-optic lines, substation upgrades, and other investments that enhance the distribution system for all customers – Dominion should be specifically empowered to undertake this work and recover the costs from ratepayers, subject to SCC approval, as it does for the rest of its grid modernization program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This approach would tamp down suspicion that Dominion is gold-plating its interconnection requirements as a way of stifling third-party solar. More importantly, it would support the kind of distribution grid upgrades needed to support all the elements of a resilient 21</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century grid.</span></p>

Explosive growth in that energy-hungry industry has everyone — utilities, the grid operator, and the industry itself — scrambling to figure out how Virginia will provide enough new power generation and transmission. And, worryingly, no one seems to have an answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or rather, lots of people have answers, but none of them achieve the trifecta of providing data centers the energy they need while continuing the explosive growth trajectory that state leaders seem to want, and at the same time keeping Virginia’s transition to zero-carbon energy on track. Something has to give. Which will it be?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no action, the “give” comes from the people of Virginia. Residents will see growth they don’t want, pay for infrastructure that doesn’t serve them, suffer from pollution that is not of their making, and see their tax dollars subsidize an industry that employs almost no one.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The no-action option isn’t a solution</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But first, a quick recap. Northern Virginia already has the largest concentration of data centers in the world. As of late 2022, data center electricity demand </span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/region-s-sluggish-solar-can-t-match-surging-data-center-demand/article_be0be72f-922b-5b5e-94c0-0ac719be236c.html#:~:text=Currently%2C%20data%20centers%20account%20for,across%20the%20entire%20PJM%20territory." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had grown to 21%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Dominion Energy Virginia’s entire load, and likely an even larger percentage of the load of Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative (NOVEC), which serves much of Data Center Alley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worse, the industry is just getting started. Grid operator PJM’s </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/planning/res-adeq/load-forecast/load-forecast-supplement.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grid forecast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> projects Dominion’s data center load will quadruple over the next 15 years, while NOVEC’s will rise to ten times what it is today. Other rural electric cooperatives in Virginia told PJM they also expect a huge demand from data centers, a prediction confirmed by </span><a href="https://www.louisacounty.gov/civicalerts.aspx?AID=363" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Amazon Web Services expects to spend $11 billion on data centers in Louisa County, in the territory of Rappahannock Electric Cooperative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7rwl01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrated Resource Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IRP) filing in May of this year, Dominion told the State Corporation Commission (SCC) that due to data center demand, it plans to ignore Virginia’s commitment to achieving a zero-carbon economy. Instead of increasing the pace of renewable energy and storage construction, it wants to keep coal plants running past their mandatory retirement dates and even build new gas combustion turbines as well as billions of dollars’ worth of new transmission infrastructure. The result will be higher costs for consumers and </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/dominion-plan-sees-carbon-emissions-rising-as-electric-use-soars/article_f360cf80-25aa-11ee-ae70-d3d88081eeaa.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">massive increases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in carbon emissions, violating the carbon-cutting mandate of the Virginia Clean Economy Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Murray, Dominion senior vice president for corporate affairs and communications,, seems to have tried for a more conciliatory tone in talking to Senate Finance Committee members last week about the challenge of meeting data center load. Murray is </span><a href="https://richmond.com/va-facing-data-center-unknowns/article_c0317099-3ad4-5b26-8bef-86391aa7e506.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=email&amp;utm_campaign=user-share" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quoted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Richmond Times-Dispatch telling members, &#8220;We have worked through these challenges before.&#8221; Isn’t that reassuring? If only it were true. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Dominion’s response has been less than adequate, others have not done better. PJM, already </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/dana-ammann/breaking-through-pjm-interconnection-queue-crisis#:~:text=The%20backlog%20is%20so%20severe,years%20just%20to%20get%20connected." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">woefully behind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on approving new renewable energy generation interconnection requests, blames states for wanting clean energy rather than doing its own job to help the market provide it. A PJM representative told the VACES audience utilities should just keep their fossil fuel plants running until it can work its way through the backlog, hopefully by 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Data Center Coalition </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/16/why-are-ratepayers-footing-the-bill-for-virginias-data-center-buildout/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t see</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> energy as its problem to solve, and its members seem strangely content to run on fossil fuels. Others in the industry are trying to do better, though. </span><a href="https://netzero-events.com/the-net-zero-data-centre-conference-paving-the-path-to-a-greener-digital-world/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whole conferences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are devoted to the subject of lowering the carbon footprint of data centers. In addition to a pledge to use renewable energy 24/7, Google has achieved remarkable levels of energy efficiency (for you nerds, they claim an average </span><a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PUE of 1.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Google, however, has only a small footprint in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon Web Services, the biggest data center company in Virginia, buys renewable energy but is not striving for the 24/7 standard. AWS’ senior manager for energy and environment public policy, Craig Sundstrom, told a panel at VACES that by 2025, AWS will have offset its use of grid power with purchases of renewable energy on the PJM grid, and he pointed to 16 solar projects the company has in operation or under development in Virginia. That’s a great start, but it’s only a start. With no battery storage in the mix, AWS will still be using grid power from fossil fuels most of the time.</span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Wishful thinking will not solve this </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what should data centers do? Or, since most of the industry doesn’t want to do anything, what should Virginia utilities and policymakers do? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VACES conference attendees had a few suggestions. The nuclear energy true believers were there, touting small modular reactors (SMRs). Gov. Youngkin and many Virginia legislators are fans of nuclear, but the timing was unfortunate. A few weeks after VACES, the first SMR in development &#8212; the one that’s supposed to prove how great the technology is &#8212; </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/nuscale-power-uamps-agree-terminate-nuclear-project-2023-11-08/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost its customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to increasing cost projections. The chances of SMRs ever outcompeting solar paired with storage seems more remote than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green hydrogen, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/04/25/is-hydrogen-a-miracle-solution-for-climate-or-the-new-ethanol/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a vital part</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of our energy future, has cost and availability problems right now, too. Microgrids powered by hydrogen fuel cells would be a fantastic solution. I’ll set my alarm for 2030 to check on how that’s going. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, representatives of Washington Gas and Roanoke Gas earnestly tried to sell the VACES audience on the virtues of methane captured from wastewater treatment plants and </span><a href="https://energynews.us/2022/03/28/this-plan-is-a-lie-biogas-on-hog-farms-could-do-more-harm-than-good/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hog waste</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cesspools like those at </span><a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/turning-hog-waste-into-biogas-green-solution-or-greenwashing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smithfield Farms’</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of this so-called renewable natural gas (RNG) may be available now, but it is exceedingly hard to imagine there would ever be enough to supply even the back-up generators at Virginia data centers, to say nothing of meeting 21% (and growing!) of Dominion’s total load. North Carolina has incentivized pig waste biogas for many years, but it still makes up only a fraction of a percentage point of that state’s energy supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To hear the gas folks tell it, though, RNG is not just carbon-neutral but carbon-</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">negative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, achieving this Holy Grail status by capturing and burning methane that would otherwise escape into the air. They assert that mixing a mere 5% of this biogas into ordinary fossil methane will effectively decarbonize the entire pipeline. In other words, we should be glad CAFOs are such an environmental disaster. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That dog won’t hunt. If gas companies get to claim the virtues of pig waste biogas, they also have to account for </span><a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2021/04/02/converting-hog-waste-into-energy-not-as-neat-and-simple-as-it-might-sound/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its vices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including the greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution associated with methane capture and leakage throughout collection and delivery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if factory farming is the answer to the needs of data centers, God help us. Maybe the tech industry should move to Iowa. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A better approach</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the better ideas coming out of VACES was a simple one: if clean energy can’t come to the load, the load should go to clean energy. Iowa, in fact, is just one of several states that get more than half their electricity from wind and solar. And indeed, some large tech companies are looking at separating their operations between those that are time-critical and need to be next to load centers and those that don’t, with the latter able to take advantage of better climates and greener energy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech companies don’t necessarily have to look beyond Virginia to take their operations to clean energy. Nothing prevents them from locating in rural counties where they can surround their data centers with fields of solar panels and banks of batteries. For that matter, a large operator like AWS could buy offshore wind, starting with the Kitty Hawk project that is still </span><a href="https://www.carolinacoastonline.com/news_times/article_cf4826da-c9a6-11ed-ba7a-7b84b99ec307.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking a customer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Virginia data center operators, though, will still need to access the PJM market. They should be expected to follow Google and buy renewable energy and storage to meet at least most of their electricity needs on a 24/7, hourly matching basis. Given the PJM bottleneck, they will need a grace period of two or three years. After that: no renewable energy, no tax subsidy.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lGun7utM94"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/15/building-more-virginia-data-centers-requires-increased-pollution-controls/">Building more Virginia data centers requires increased pollution controls</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Building more Virginia data centers requires increased pollution controls&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/02/15/building-more-virginia-data-centers-requires-increased-pollution-controls/embed/#?secret=dhXOTZC4mf#?secret=lGun7utM94" data-secret="lGun7utM94" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s point one of our data center strategy. Point two: data centers that have to source their own renewable energy will be motivated to use less energy, but Virginia can also set an energy efficiency minimum they should meet to qualify for Virginia’s tax subsidies. They need not match Google’s success, but they should come close. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Point three: Dominion claimed in its IRP that it could not build enough solar itself to meet the soaring data center demand; this was its excuse for keeping expensive coal plants running beyond their planned retirement dates. If Dominion can’t build it, let others do it. The General Assembly should remove the 35% limit on the amount of solar and storage capacity that third-party developers can provide. A little free-market competition never hurt anyone. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Point four: If the growth of data centers requires utilities to invest more for energy generation and power lines, the data centers should be the ones paying the extra cost, not residential customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Point five: Leaders should not separate the joy they feel in attracting data centers from the pain their constituents feel in living with data centers and transmission lines, breathing pollution from diesel back-up generators and having the quality and quantity of their freshwater resources threatened. Data center developers and revenue-hungry local governments are not the appropriate decision makers for development at this scale. The administration should convene a task force with the job and power to do comprehensive planning for data center siting, development and resource use. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting these five points will not stop data centers from locating in Virginia, and that isn’t the goal. What it will ensure is that the development is well planned out, fair and equitable to everyone.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every three years, a nationwide group of building safety professionals known as the </span><a href="https://www.iccsafe.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Code Council</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (ICC) publishes updated model building codes that form the basis for most U.S. state and local building codes. ICC codes address essential features like structural integrity, fire safety, plumbing and energy use. As technologies improve, so do the model codes. A home built to the 2021 </span><a href="https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IECC2021P1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Energy Conservation Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IECC), for example, uses </span><a href="https://www.energycodes.gov/determinations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9.38% less energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than one built to the 2018 model code, which was itself a </span><a href="https://www.energycodes.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/2018IECC_CE_Residential.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">significant improvement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the 2015 model code, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most home buyers take these things for granted. We don’t know the ins and outs of building technologies or codes, and we don’t want to. It is the job of ICC professionals to set modern standards, and the job of state and local government to ensure builders meet them. Right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except it doesn’t always work that way. Some states and localities do adopt each new iteration of the model codes as a matter of course; Maryland is one such state. Across the river in Virginia, however, important energy efficiency elements of the residential building code are stuck all the way back in 2009, because the builder-dominated board in charge of Virginia’s building code refuses to adopt more rigorous standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This intransigence has cost Virginia residents millions of dollars over the years in higher energy bills, especially for heating and cooling. A July 2021 analysis by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory </span><a href="https://www.energycodes.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/VirginiaResidentialCostEffectiveness_2021_0.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that adopting the 2021 IECC would save Virginians $2.5 billion over 30 years, the typical mortgage term. Their analysis assumed mortgages included the added cost of meeting the </span><a href="https://newbuildings.org/key-takeaways-from-recent-iecc-code-development-hearings/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">updated requirements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so the $2.5 billion is pure savings, reflected in yearly cash flow savings averaging $250 per homeowner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Faced with high utility bills, owners of existing homes sometimes spring for expensive retrofits to upgrade heating and cooling systems, install new windows and add insulation. These investments often pay off in lower utility bills, but it costs more to retrofit than to build it right the first time. There are also limits to how much energy can be saved through retrofits. It can be very difficult, for example, to add insulation to the walls of an existing home. The right time to make a house weather-proof and energy efficient is during design and construction.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders resist meeting the highest efficiency standards for one simple reason: it costs more to build high-efficiency homes, cutting into profits. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/02/08/affordable-housing-concerns-tank-energy-efficiency-proposal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders insist</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they are just trying to keep home prices down, but that rings hollow. Anyone who has gone house-shopping knows the price of a home is determined by supply and demand, not building cost. Builders will charge whatever they can get.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/01/27/general-assembly-should-require-building-code-updates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Builders also say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> home buyers don’t ask for efficient homes, but that claim is also suspect. Unlike granite counters and high-end finishes, energy upgrades are frequently invisible to buyers, so they don’t know to ask for them or how to evaluate any claims a builder makes about them. Let’s face it, most of us wouldn’t know an </span><a href="https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/seal_insulate/identify_problems_you_want_fix/diy_checks_inspections/insulation_r_values#:~:text=R%2DValue%20is%20a%20measure,and%20locations%20in%20the%20home." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">R-value</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if a batt of insulation fell on our heads. Nor should we have to know. This is why we have building codes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, protecting consumers from drafty homes and high utility bills is not a priority of the building industry and its allies that control Virginia’s code adoption process. For years the Board of Housing and Community Development (BHCD) has refused to adopt the full model efficiency code, leaving old exceptions in place. Standards for wall insulation and air leakage (the measure of how drafty a home feels) haven’t been updated since 2009.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly knows this is a problem. Virginia law has long required BHCD to adopt standards consistent with model codes such as the IECC. Faced with the board’s continuing intransigence, in 2021 legislators passed a new</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0425+pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directing BHCD to “consider adopting Building Code standards that are at least as stringent as those contained in [each] new version of the IECC.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consider” looks like a loophole you could drive a truck through, but the new law goes on to add a specific requirement that the BHCD “shall assess the public health, safety, and welfare benefits of adopting standards that are at least as stringent as those contained in the IECC, including potential energy savings and air quality benefits over time compared to the cost of initial construction.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sounds like a slam-dunk for adoption of the IECC standards, given the studies confirming that building to the higher standards benefits occupants and the public with </span><a href="https://smartenergy.illinois.edu/indoor-air-quality/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better air quality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and with utility bill savings over time that far exceed what it costs a builder to meet those standards. Legislators and advocates who worked to pass the legislation reasonably expected BHCD to adopt the 2021 IECC in its entirety, if not go beyond it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That did not happen. During the slow process of updating Virginia’s residential building code over the ensuing months, BHCD never took the new law seriously. It never conducted the required analysis, and there is no indication it even “considered” adopting the full 2021 IECC standards, in spite of in-depth comments from experts and testimony from the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The building code update BHCD </span><a href="https://register.dls.virginia.gov/details.aspx?id=10597" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in December of 2022 and approved in its </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/Docx/bhcd/book-6-final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">final form</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on August 28 of this year neither removed past weakening amendments nor adopted more stringent standards.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Indeed, BHCD even decided this year to roll some commercial efficiency standards back to 2006 levels! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps this sad state of affairs should not surprise us too much, given who our governors  – past and present  – have appointed to </span><a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/board-housing-and-community-development-bhcd#:~:text=The%20Board%20of%20Housing%20and,executive%20director%20of%20the%20Virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the board</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By my count, 8 of the 11 appointed members</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"> represent home builders; another member works for a mortgage company. The foxes are in charge of the hen house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those appointments were not a matter of luck. Public </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/180223/donors_sector_totals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show construction and real estate companies gave almost $13 million to Glenn Youngkin’s 2021 campaign for governor, the second largest industry donor to his campaign. Four years previously, the industry donated “only” $2.5 million to the campaign of Youngkin’s Democratic predecessor, Ralph Northam. In both cases, the board appointments that followed heavily favored the home building industry, with the result that Virginia’s residential building codes seem to be permanently stuck in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia leaders pride themselves on being pro-business, but that doesn’t have to mean being anti-consumer. The commonwealth as a whole would benefit from a housing stock that is more weather-resilient and healthier for occupants, that saves energy, and that reduces residents’ utility bills.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that really too much to ask?</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How much do Virginia’s elections matter in an off year? Measured by the turnout in past elections, you’d think the answer is “not much.” The percentage of registered voters who show up at the polls in Virginia typically drops </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registrationturnout-statistics/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">well below 50%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when no federal or statewide candidates are on the ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But measured by how much the outcome of this year’s election could affect the lives of regular people, the battle for control of the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates matters enormously. With a Republican in the governor’s mansion, a Democratic edge in either or both chambers would continue the status quo of divided government and (mostly) consensus-based lawmaking. A Republican takeover of both chambers, on the other hand, would lead to a wave of new legislation imposing the conservative social agenda on abortion, gay rights, transgender issues, education and welfare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would also put an end to Virginia’s leadership on climate and clean energy and lead to costly initiatives protecting fossil fuels, at the expense of consumers and the environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the divisions between the two parties are well-known, and the consequences of one party edging out the other are clear. For some issues, however, the party positions are not as obvious, and it takes a look under the hood to understand where elections matter. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia’s clean energy transition is at risk</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start with the obvious: the broad framework of Virginia’s energy transition to clean energy is a signature achievement of Democrats that Republicans have in the crosshairs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three and a half years ago, Virginia made history as the first Southern state to commit to zero-carbon electricity by 2050 with detailed and specific guidance. The next year, the General Assembly followed up with legislation to begin the transition to electric vehicles.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean energy investments soared after passage of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA). Solar installations in 2020 and 2021 </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/virginia-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dwarfed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> previous numbers, and the state solar market is now a </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/2023-09/Virginia.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$5.1 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> industry employing over 4,700 workers. Private investment dollars have poured into small-scale renewable energy as well, funding solar on schools, churches and government buildings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VCEA’s support for offshore wind gave that industry the certainty it needed to move beyond the pilot project stage. Foundations for the first of 176 turbines of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project are currently </span><a href="https://www.offshorewind.biz/2023/09/27/first-coastal-virginia-monopiles-en-route-to-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on their way</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Portsmouth Marine Terminal. By the end of 2026, the turbines are expected to provide enough electricity to power more than 600,000 homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communities benefited from Virginia’s entry into the carbon-cutting Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), as </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2023/09/21/editorial-theres-no-plan-to-offset-lost-rggi-revenue-used-for-flood-projects/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$730 million in new revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> flowed to the Commonwealth for flood mitigation and low-income home weatherization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And after passage of the Clean Cars law, sales of electric vehicles in Virginia are </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/dominion-sees-rapid-growth-for-electric-vehicles-in-virginia/article_c94bd5e2-e8f5-11ed-b20e-079f4cd2e6cc.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set to double</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the end of next year, and to double again by 2026.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iFzW1rVRun"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/19/a-bright-spot-at-the-intersection-of-farming-electric-vehicles-and-solar-energy/">A bright spot at the intersection of farming, electric vehicles and solar energy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;A bright spot at the intersection of farming, electric vehicles and solar energy&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/19/a-bright-spot-at-the-intersection-of-farming-electric-vehicles-and-solar-energy/embed/#?secret=hPlJcKMnQQ#?secret=iFzW1rVRun" data-secret="iFzW1rVRun" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, however, the election of Gov. Glenn Youngkin and a narrow Republican majority in the House of Delegates put these gains at risk. Early on, Youngkin declared his intent to repeal the VCEA and the Clean Cars law and pull Virginia out of RGGI. Only a Democratic majority in the Senate stopped legislative rollbacks passed by House Republicans in 2022 and 2023. Loss of that majority would ensure repeal of Clean Cars and the evisceration of VCEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for RGGI, the failure to repeal the law led Youngkin to attempt to pull Virginia out through an administrative rulemaking that will be contested in court. He could sidestep a court battle and do it legally through legislation if his party takes control of the General Assembly.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">“No-brainer” bills killed in small committees</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a clear divide separates the two parties on signature Democratic initiatives like VCEA and RGGI, party membership is the determining factor on other energy and climate bills in less obvious ways. House rules allow a subcommittee consisting of as few as 5 members to vote down a bill by majority vote, keeping it from being heard by the full committee. With Republicans in control of the House, every subcommittee has a Republican majority, and Democratic bills routinely die on 3-2 votes. This can be true even if a bill has already passed the Senate, and even if the Senate vote was bipartisan – or for that matter, unanimous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Senate operates very differently. There, a subcommittee can only make recommendations. It takes a vote of the full committee to kill a bill in the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might wonder: if a bill is such a no-brainer that it passes the Senate unanimously or by a wide bipartisan majority, why would it get voted down in the House at all? Wouldn’t the bipartisan endorsement suggest this is actually a good bill that even the party in charge of the House would want to support, or at least have heard in full committee?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, when a no-brainer bill is killed in a tiny House subcommittee along party lines, it is rarely because the bill’s patron just happened to find the only few people in the General Assembly who don’t like the bill. More typically, it’s because the governor or the caucus itself has taken a position against the bill, but doesn’t want to draw attention to that fact. The subcommittee members tasked with doing the killing let everyone else in the party keep their hands clean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This explains the fate of Fairfax Democrat Sen. Chap Petersen’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ240" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to study the effect of data centers on Virginia’s environment, economy, energy resources and ability to meet carbon-reduction goals. The bill passed unanimously by voice vote in the Senate before dying at the hands of three Republicans in a five-person subcommittee of the House Rules committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data center study was the very definition of a no-brainer bill. The unbridled growth of data centers has ignited protests in communities across Virginia, and the industry’s voracious appetite for energy is </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/08/16/why-are-ratepayers-footing-the-bill-for-virginias-data-center-buildout/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blowing up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia’s climate goals, according to Dominion Energy. How can it be that House Republicans don’t even want to study the issue?</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eIsxHiRcwk"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/16/why-are-ratepayers-footing-the-bill-for-virginias-data-center-buildout/">Why are ratepayers footing the bill for Virginia’s data center buildout?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Why are ratepayers footing the bill for Virginia’s data center buildout?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/08/16/why-are-ratepayers-footing-the-bill-for-virginias-data-center-buildout/embed/#?secret=wo3fA0empK#?secret=eIsxHiRcwk" data-secret="eIsxHiRcwk" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer lies in the fact that the Youngkin administration testified against the three data center bills that were heard in the Senate. One of Youngkin’s proudest achievements in office was the deal with Amazon to bring another $35 billion worth of data centers to Virginia. He does not want a study that would bring negative realities to light, so the bill had to die. The Republican members of the subcommittee were merely the executioners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another no-brainer </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1471" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that never made it to a full committee vote is one that gets introduced year after year: a prohibition on using campaign funds for personal purposes. This year’s legislation passed the Senate unanimously before just five Republicans</span> <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/politics/capitol-connection/bipartisan-push-to-ban-personal-use-of-campaign-money-in-virginia-fails/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted to scuttle the bill</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in a House Privileges and Elections subcommittee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My guess is you could not find a voter anywhere in Virginia who thinks legislators should be able to take money donated to their election campaigns and spend it on themselves. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/07/by-allowing-political-cash-for-personal-use-virginia-remains-a-campaign-finance-backwater/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justifying it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires legislators to turn themselves into logical pretzels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The combination of unlimited campaign giving by donors and unrestricted spending by the recipients makes it easy for powerful corporations like Dominion Energy to </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-the-utility-company-lobbying-blitz-that-will-hike-electric-bills" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buy influence</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s influence was clearly at work this year when a House subcommittee killed a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1266" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have made shared solar available to more Virginians, over Dominion’s opposition. The bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support before losing 4-2 on a party-line vote in a House Commerce and Energy subcommittee.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is less clear whether Dominion had a hand in the death of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB848" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would help localities put solar on schools. The legislation passed the Senate unanimously before being killed in House Appropriations, again on a straight party-line vote.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly, there have been plenty of Democrats over the years who have voted for Dominion’s interest time and again. Conversely, not all the no-brainer bills killed by House Republicans reflect a hostility to the energy transition; sometimes the problem seems to be a hostility to environmental protections in general. Thus a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1013" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to require customer notification when water tests show contamination from PFAS – known commonly as “forever chemicals” – passed the Senate unanimously and then was killed in a House subcommittee on, yet again, a party-line vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be hard to identify a consistent line of reasoning behind all the anti-environment votes across all the various subcommittees, but the pattern is clear enough. It reflects not just the positions of individual legislators, but a firm party line. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether voters care about these votes now is not clear, mainly because the news media rarely look at the role of the environment, climate and energy in elections. Regardless, these issues will be very much at stake at the polls next month. </span></p>

(Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The energy transition is in full swing across the U.S. and the world, but the changes now underway are not simple or linear. In an economy as complex and connected as ours, progress in one area will often affect other parts of the economy, creating winners and losers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there are the changes that work together synergistically and leave everyone better off. This is what we will see as renewable energy overtakes fossil fuels and electric vehicles go mainstream. These transformations will deliver another enormous benefit, this time to farmland, as they pull the rug out from under the expensive and wasteful ethanol industry.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Counting Corn</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the United States, more than 30 million acres of farmland is currently devoted to growing corn for a purpose other than feeding humans and animals. The corn – over </span><a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10339" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 billion bushels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every year — is processed into ethanol and then added to gasoline to comply with a federal mandate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), enacted in 2005, requires the nation&#8217;s oil refiners to mix </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-corn-based-ethanol-worse-climate-than-gasoline-study-finds-2022-02-14/#:~:text=Under%20the%20U.S.%20Renewable%20Fuel,into%20the%20nation%27s%20gasoline%20annually." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 billion gallons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of corn-based ethanol into the nation&#8217;s gasoline supply annually; this is the reason why most gasoline sold in the U.S. includes 10% ethanol. The mandate was intended to cut U.S. dependence on energy imports, support farmers and reduce emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it turned out, the RFS was primarily successful in increasing the acreage devoted to growing corn. Because of the ethanol mandate, an </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-corn-based-ethanol-worse-climate-than-gasoline-study-finds-2022-02-14/#:~:text=The%20policy%20was%20intended%20to,and%202016%2C%20the%20study%20found." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional 6.9 million acres</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of corn were planted between 2008 and 2016. Corn is now the nation’s number one crop and, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, ethanol production </span><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn-and-other-feed-grains/feed-grains-sector-at-a-glance/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accounts for</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 45% of the U.S. corn crop. Most of the rest goes to animal feed, with only 15% destined for human consumption. (A mere half of one percent of the total corn crop is </span><a href="https://aei.ag/2023/08/07/sweet-corn-production-trends/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20U.S.%20harvested,Corn%20Acres%2C%202016%2D2022" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sweet corn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a different plant entirely.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a way to reduce emissions, however, the mandate proved a failure. A study funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Wildlife Federation </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-corn-based-ethanol-worse-climate-than-gasoline-study-finds-2022-02-14/#:~:text=The%20research%2C%20which%20was%20funded,along%20with%20processing%20and%20combustion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">concluded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that ethanol is at least 24% more carbon-intensive than gasoline, once land use impacts are factored in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a bad deal for taxpayers, too. In addition to the ethanol mandate, the U.S. government subsidizes corn farmers through the </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53375-federalcropinsuranceprogram.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal crop insurance program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with taxpayers covering an average of 62% of the cost of insurance premiums. More than a quarter of the insurance subsidy goes to corn, and </span><a href="https://sustainableagriculture.net/blog/record-high-crop-insurance-subsidies-are-unsustainable/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">very little</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goes to small farms. Add to this the many concerns about water use, fertilizer, pesticides and land degradation, and it is hard to find much good in the corn ethanol program.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">EVs threaten King Corn</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world is a different place now than it was in 2005, with the U.S. having become the </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/10/08/us-is-worlds-largest-oil-producer-why-youre-going-pay-more-gas-anyway/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest oil producer in the world</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a net exporter. Yet the ethanol subsidy is fiercely guarded by the corn lobby and, in spite of occasional bipartisan </span><a href="https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/7/feinstein-toomey-menendez-collins-introduce-bipartisan-bill-to-repeal-ethanol-mandate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">efforts at repeal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it seems to be untouchable politically. Indeed, last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Democrats, actually contains new credits for biofuel production that corn-state Republicans are </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/04/26/ethanol-clean-energy-fuel-drama-over-gop-debt-limit-deal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keen on keeping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> even as they continue to seek rollbacks of other clean energy incentives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest threat to the corn lobby, though, isn’t a repeal of the mandate, it’s electric vehicles. When people no longer need gasoline, they can no longer be forced to buy corn ethanol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric vehicle sales reached 5% of the U.S. new car market in 2022, and already this year they’ve hit 8.6%. JD Power </span><a href="https://www.jdpower.com/business/resources/america-grows-increasingly-divided-ev-adoption" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 70% of new vehicles will be electric by 2035, with California leading the way at 94% by then. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many agricultural communities </span><a href="https://www.crestonnews.com/news/local/2022/10/26/evs-changing-the-future-of-ethanol/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are in denial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about EVs, preferring to believe they will never catch on in numbers enough to threaten the importance of the corn crop. And indeed, it will take decades before the last gasoline-powered cars drive off to the junkyard. But most of us can see the writing on the wall. As more vehicles become electric, more land that is now devoted to corn ethanol will become available for other purposes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the ethanol industry looks to jet fuel and other possible </span><a href="https://www.card.iastate.edu/ag_policy_review/article/?a=147" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new uses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for its product, a far more promising “crop” is renewable energy. Planting wind turbines and solar panels, either alone or combined with actual crops that feed people, provides higher returns with less risk and is better for the planet. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">“Planting” more solar energy instead of corn</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind turbines already coexist with farmland across the Great Plains, but let’s focus on solar, since that is the form of renewable energy best suited to Virginia’s landscape. Solar energy is somewhat land-intensive, but not compared to corn. A decade ago, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/35097.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calculated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that we could power the country’s entire electricity demand with 10 million acres of solar panels. That’s only one-third of the land now devoted to corn ethanol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since that study, solar </span><a href="https://eta-publications.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/land_requirements_for_utility-scale_pv.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiency has increased</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while electricity demand has </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/use-of-electricity.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">risen only modestly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With the electrification of vehicles, buildings, and everything else that can be electrified, however, electricity demand is </span><a href="https://regeneration.org/nexus/electrify-everything#:~:text=Even%20though%20electrifying%20everything%20will,2050%20to%20meet%20expected%20demand." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">likely to double</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But even if we had no wind energy, hydropower or nuclear, and we needed 20 million acres of solar to meet the demand, that would represent only two-thirds of the land currently devoted to corn ethanol, leaving millions of acres more freed up for food crops, land conservation and </span><a href="https://allianceforscience.org/blog/2020/10/rewilding-farmland-can-protect-biodiversity-and-sequester-carbon-new-study-finds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rewilding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A comparison of the energy yield of corn vs. solar shows why displacing ethanol with solar energy would be a welcome change.  An acre of corn </span><a href="https://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/alternative-fuels/question707.htm#:~:text=Through%20research%20performed%20at%20Cornell,kg)%20of%20corn%20per%20gallon." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">yields 328 gallons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of ethanol, which is </span><a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ethanol.shtml#/find/nearest?country=US&amp;fuel=E85" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-third less efficient</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than gasoline. If you could run an internal combustion automobile entirely on ethanol (you can’t), a car averaging 40 miles per gallon could go 8,738 miles on an acre of corn. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that same acre “planted” in solar panels </span><a href="https://www.solarempower.com/blog/how-much-money-1-acre-solar-panels-make-income/#:~:text=As%20a%20general%20rule%2C%201,solar%20panels%20is%20about%20%24450%2C000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would yield 394-447 MWh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per year of electricity. Even at the low end, that’s enough to power a Tesla Model 3 for over 100,000 miles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the corn crop is grown in places like Iowa and Nebraska, but even here in Virginia, </span><a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Virginia/Publications/Current_News_Release/2022/JUNACR22_VA.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">540,000 acres</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were planted in corn last year, second only to soybeans. Assuming 45% of Virginia’s crop goes to corn ethanol (I could not find an actual breakdown by state), that amounts to 243,000 acres that could be put to better use. That’s worth keeping in mind for the next time someone frets about farmland being “lost” to solar development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar is also a more reliable crop, and a better one for small farmers. The profitability of corn growing varies by state and by year, but it is never exactly a lucrative business for any but the largest farm operations. In a good year, such as 2022, corn might return </span><a href="https://agecon.ca.uky.edu/grain-profitability-outlook-2022#:~:text=The%20expected%20gross%20profit%20for,subtracting%20out%20the%20land%20rent." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a profit of $450 per acre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, minus land rents (or taxes). In a down year, such as the current one, returns can be </span><a href="https://farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2023/05/back-to-normal-revised-2023-budgets-with-lower-prices.html#:~:text=Operator%20and%20land%20return%20for,the%20%24698%20return%20in%202022." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">negative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> once land costs are accounted for. (Rents vary considerably, averaging </span><a href="https://www.fcsamerica.com/resources/education/common-ground/common-ground/2022/12/27/corn-vs.-soybeans-determining-profitability-in-2023" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about $325</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per acre.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, solar lease rates range from </span><a href="https://www.solarlandlease.com/lease-rates-for-solar-farms-how-valuable-is-my-land" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$250 to $2000 per acre</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on location and suitability. A guaranteed payment for 20 or 30 years with no work involved is a pretty attractive deal. Even putting just a portion of a farm into solar provides a form of insurance, guaranteeing a steady income flow regardless of weather and commodity price swings.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="w1noZxyANX"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/08/04/stop-whining-about-solar-panels-we-need-more-now/">Stop whining about solar panels — we need more now</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar is also a better deal than corn for the community, since it provides tax revenue, diversifies the local economy and conserves water. If the developer plants pollinator-friendly species around the solar panels or uses sheep instead of machinery to control grass, the benefits to the local economy increase further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ethanol industry is already looking for new uses for their product, but if they don’t find takers, it is one fuel we don’t need to mourn losing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter24/section56-598/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) is supposed to explain how the utility expects to meet demand reliably and at low cost within the constraints of the law. In </span><a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/-/media/pdfs/global/company/desc-2023-integrated-resource-plan.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this IRP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however, Dominion asked a different question: how to make Gov. Glenn Youngkin happy by keeping fossil fuels dominant </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">regardless </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of both law and cost. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming up with a favorable answer required Dominion to ignore the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), create arbitrary limits on solar deployment, use wishful thinking instead of facts and, for good measure, do basic math wrong. They also assume the Youngkin administration will succeed in pulling Virginia out of the carbon-cutting Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a move that is being </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/31/virginia-enviro-groups-file-notice-they-will-challenge-youngkins-rggi-withdrawal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in court. This makes Dominion’s IRP, with its plan to send carbon emissions soaring, a sort of evil twin to a plan from any RGGI state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough, </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/may/name-1002282-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the governor loves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it. Elsewhere, however, this evil twin found a cold reception. Experts retained by environmental, consumer and industry groups all agree that this IRP should be chucked in the trash bin and Dominion told to start over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth taking a look at the testimony from these groups to understand where Dominion went so badly wrong, and what a better plan might look like. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">It’s all about the data centers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Northern Virginia data centers are the driving force behind Dominion’s plans to burn more coal and gas, but there is some disagreement whether their growth will be absolutely off-the-charts crazy, or merely eye-poppingly huge. Dominion’s IRP projects the data center industry’s power use in its territory will quadruple over the next 15 years, rising from 2,767 megawatts (MW) in 2022 to more than 11,000 MW in 2038. At that point it would represent close to 40% of Dominion’s load. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experts testifying in the IRP case believe data center demand </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7tyx01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won’t reach the dizzying heights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dominion projects. They question whether Virginia communities will accept so much new data center development, given the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/02/are-virginia-ratepayers-and-residents-subsidizing-the-data-center-industry/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pushback</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already evident in localities like Prince William and Fauquier Counties. Their thinking is essentially that if things can’t go on this way, they probably won’t.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RIlUvT8TAo"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/09/virginia-has-a-data-center-problem/">Virginia has a data center problem</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Virginia has a data center problem&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/09/virginia-has-a-data-center-problem/embed/#?secret=iyr3FsdUir#?secret=RIlUvT8TAo" data-secret="RIlUvT8TAo" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also suggest that some of the demand Dominion expects may also be reflected in the plans of other utilities serving Northern Virginia’s </span><a href="https://biz.loudoun.gov/datacenteralley/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data Center Alley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leading to double-counting. A </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/planning/res-adeq/load-forecast/load-forecast-supplement.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">load forecast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by grid operator PJM shows that Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative (NOVEC) projects its data center demand to rise from about 400 MW in 2022 to 4,000 by 2028 and 8,000 by 2034. Two other cooperatives project a combined 3,000 MW of data center development in the same time period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from data centers, demand for electricity in Dominion territory is </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/planning/res-adeq/load-forecast/load-forecast-supplement.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flat or declining</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the next fifteen years; presumably this is due to the increased efficiency of homes and businesses offsetting the increased demand from electric vehicles and building electrification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were already experiencing vertigo over Dominion’s data center numbers, and you are now hearing for the first time that Dominion’s numbers represent only half of the total </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/15/building-more-virginia-data-centers-requires-increased-pollution-controls/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected data center load</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> coming to Virginia, maybe you won’t find it all that cheering that some of that added demand could be illusory. Still, it is a reasonable point. If you reduce demand by a few thousand megawatts here and there, pretty soon you might not “need” a new gas plant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an aside, one Virginia utility stands out for apparently </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expecting much in the way of new data centers in its territory. Appalachian Power, which serves customers in Southwest Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee, has experienced declining demand for years, and rural Virginia leaders would dearly love to see data centers come there. Yet the PJM forecast shows Appalachian Power’s parent company, American Electric Power (AEP), told grid operators it expected only about another 200 MW on top of the 500 MW of data center load it serves across its entire 11-state territory. AEP seems to regard this as quite a lot, which, when compared with what is happening in Northern Virginia, seems rather sweet.</span></p>

(Hugh Kenny)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t help but wonder how Gov. Youngkin managed to make a </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/january/name-991808-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Amazon to bring $35 billion worth of new data centers to Virginia without securing a guarantee that many of the facilities would be located in a part of the state that actually has surplus energy capacity and desperately needs new economic development. Southwest Virginia voters may have </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-virginia-election-2020-campaign-2016-1e50b5d47eac70e65bed5be5b9fa7fa4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">put Youngkin in office</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; you’d think he’d be looking out for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of real investment today, Youngkin promises the area a little nuclear plant a decade from now, when and if small modular reactors (SMRs) prove viable. Local leaders must be muttering, “Gee, thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this leads to another point raised by several of the experts in the IRP case: All of the load growth Dominion projects is due to a single industry in Northern Virginia; elsewhere, demand is decreasing. Yet, instead of crafting a solution specific to the industry and region experiencing runaway growth, Dominion proposes to build a fossil fuel plant 140 miles away in Chesterfield and a nuclear plant 300 miles away in another utility’s territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gregory Abbott, a former SCC Deputy Director, offers a particularly withering assessment of the IRP in his </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7ty%2501!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testimony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on behalf of environmental advocacy group Appalachian Voices. Dominion’s computer model, he says, “is proposing supply-side solutions that are not focused on solving the actual problem, are likely unnecessary, and driving costs higher than they should be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Dominion insists this IRP represents just a “snapshot in time,” Abbott says that’s misleading: The IRP “sets the stage for multi-billion-dollar investments that Dominion’s customers will pay for decades to come. If a future snapshot in time changes, based on new public policy goals or market dynamics, ratepayers are stuck with paying for these sunk costs.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Garbage in, garbage out</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abbott and others also note that unlike factories or other high consumers of energy, data center operators can shift some functions to other data centers elsewhere for short periods of time. Dominion could save money and reduce the need for new investments by capitalizing on this capability to develop demand-response programs tailored specifically to this industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, Dominion treated the surge in demand as if it were statewide and spread across all its customers; then it used a computer model to figure out how to meet the soaring demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An expert for the Sierra Club, Devi Glick of Synapse Energy Economics, </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7ty_01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted several problems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Dominion’s approach. Among them: the company told its computer model that it couldn’t select energy efficiency as a resource; it had to include gas combustion turbines in 2028; it had to adhere to artificial limits on solar, wind and battery storage; and it had to assume prices for solar that were “substantially higher than industry projections.” Dominion also did not instruct the model to account for proposed (and since finalized) new federal pollution limits that will raise the cost of burning fossil fuels, and miscalculated — by a billion dollars — the penalties associated with failure to meet the VCEA’s renewable energy requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As they say, garbage in, garbage out. The model did what it was told, and produced plans that limited solar and battery storage, called for new gas combustion turbines and/or SMRs, and kept uneconomic coal plants running past their previously-planned retirement dates. Accordingly, none of the modeled scenarios complied with Virginia law and all would be unnecessarily expensive for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Synapse ran its own computer model that kept most of Dominion’s load and cost assumptions but corrected for the company’s errors and artificial constraints. The results, not surprisingly, show that building more solar and storage and retiring coal plants earlier than Dominion wants to will lower carbon emissions and “reduce costs for Dominion’s ratepayers by between $4.1 and $9.0 billion over the 25-year study period.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Synapse then tweaked the model to reflect the new federal pollution rules and prices for solar and battery storage in line with industry projections, the results saw solar and battery investments soaring, while the “need” for firm capacity such as a new gas plant disappeared altogether during the planning period.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Clean energy, vindicated</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So finally, we begin to see a path forward founded on real data and not constrained by political expediency. With none of its plans meeting the basic requirements of Virginia law, Dominion should be ordered to go back to the drawing board. The company should reexamine its data center load projections and design a demand-response program tailored to that industry. Then it should re-run its computer model with energy efficiency allowed as a resource, with no artificial constraints on battery storage and renewable energy,with federal and state compliance costs associated with fossil fuels fully included and with cost estimates for solar and storage consistent with industry norms.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly has a role to play, too, in ensuring the data center industry does not shift costs onto other customers and cause Virginia to fall short of its carbon reduction goals. Data centers should be required to meet energy efficiency targets and to secure an increasing percentage of renewable energy on their own as a condition of obtaining generous state tax subsidies. Likewise, the State Corporation Commission should be required to ensure that data centers pay for the transmission upgrades they need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, it’s clear that the computer models will select as much low-cost solar as they are allowed to, so the General Assembly should make it easier to build solar projects at competitive rates. They can do this by further opening the market to third-party developers, who are currently constrained by an interpretation of the VCEA that caps their share of the solar Dominion procures at 35%. </span></p>

With data center growth the “key driver,” Dominion projects a massive increase in the demand for electricity. As a result, the utility claims the state-mandated transition to clean energy is now impossible to achieve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jettisoning its commitment to the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), Dominion proposes to keep running uneconomic coal and biomass plants that were previously slated for closure, build a new fossil gas plant and pay penalties instead of meeting state renewable energy targets, all of which mean higher costs for customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/10/law-what-law-pandering-to-the-governor-dominions-new-plan-ignores-virginias-climate-law/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said at the time</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, this IRP is primarily a political document aimed at currying favor with a gas-loving governor. It is not a serious plan. For example, a Sierra Club</span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7ty_01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the State Corporation Commission describes how Dominion put artificial constraints into its computer modeling (including limits on new solar) to ensure the plan came out fossil-friendly. Moreover, Dominion’s demand projections are inflated, </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7tyx01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the clean energy industry group Advanced Energy United.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But for the sake of discussion, let’s take the IRP at face value. And in that case, I have some questions. How did Dominion let itself get blindsided by the data center growth spurt? Why are the rest of us expected to pay for infrastructure that’s only needed for data centers? Does the Governor understand that </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/january/name-991808-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bring another $35 billion worth of new Amazon data centers to Virginia  is driving up energy rates for everyone else? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, and while I’m at it, are tech company commitments to sourcing renewable energy just a pack of lies?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/09/virginia-has-a-data-center-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data center problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is well known. Northern Virginia has the largest concentration of data centers in the world, by far. Data centers are Dominion’s single largest category of commercial power users, already consuming </span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/region-s-sluggish-solar-can-t-match-surging-data-center-demand/article_be0be72f-922b-5b5e-94c0-0ac719be236c.html#:~:text=Currently%2C%20data%20centers%20account%20for,across%20the%20entire%20PJM%20territory." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 21%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of total electricity supply and slated to hit 50% by 2038. In addition to the new generation that will be required, data centers </span><a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/news/dominion-scrambles-to-meet-soaring-power-demand/article_f475db14-1215-53d9-8130-cb3f83d254cd.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">need grid upgrades</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including new transmission lines, transformers and breakers, with the costs spread to all ratepayers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents are not happy. Controversy around data centers’ </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/28/temporary-air-pollution-exception-for-data-centers-sparks-opposition-in-northern-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">diesel generators</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, their water use, noise and visual impacts have spread outward from Loudoun County into Prince William, Fauquier, and even other parts of Virginia as massive new developments are proposed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data center developers don’t build without assurance they will have access to the huge amount of electricity they need for their operations, so they have to start discussions with their utility early. Yet in July of 2022, Dominion stunned the data center industry by warning it would not be able to meet new demand in Loudoun County </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/dominion-energy-admits-it-cant-meet-data-center-power-demands-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">until 2025 or 2026</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The utility said, however, that the problem was not generating capacity, but transmission. So, what gives?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that it would be better if Dominion anticipated the oncoming tsunami but kept it secret until this spring. You have to wonder whether the General Assembly would have approved hundreds of millions of dollars in </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/02/a-dog-a-food-fight-and-other-energy-highlights-from-the-2023-general-assembly-session/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grants and tax subsidies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for new Amazon data centers in February if legislators understood the effect would be to upend the VCEA and drive up energy costs for residents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republicans are no doubt pleased that Dominion’s IRP undermines the VCEA, but they shouldn’t be. Dominion proposes keeping coal plants open not for economic reasons, but in spite of them. These plants were slated for closure in previous IRPs because they were costing ratepayers too much money. Now Dominion says it needs more generating capacity and can’t (or rather, won’t) build enough low-cost solar to keep up with new data center demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion also proposes to build a new methane gas combustion “peaker” plant that wasn’t in its last IRP, and again the company points to data center growth as the reason. Peaker plants are an expensive way to generate power; on average, the cost of energy from gas combustion is </span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/research-insights/2023-levelized-cost-of-energyplus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about double</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that of a solar/storage combination, or even triple once you factor in federal clean energy incentives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping the fossil fuel party going instead of embracing more solar isn’t the only way this IRP drives rates higher for customers. Limiting its solar investments means Dominion expects to miss the VCEA’s renewable energy percentage targets by a mile. The shortfall would subject Dominion to significant penalties. The kicker is, Dominion can pass the cost of those penalties  on to ratepayers, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of your political persuasion, then, this IRP is bad news for Virginia consumers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also concerning that the driver of all these higher costs and carbon emissions is the high-tech industry that is so eager to be seen as a leader in sustainability. If these tech companies were meeting their power needs with renewable energy, Dominion wouldn’t be able to claim a “need” to keep its old coal plants belching away.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon, the number one beneficiary of state data center largesse, says it is the leading corporate purchaser of renewable energy globally. Its </span><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/amazons-solar-and-wind-projects-support-communities-throughout-the-southeastern-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> claims the company is “on a path to powering our operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025.” A </span><a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/climate-solutions/renewable-energy?energyType=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows it has developed around 16 solar projects in Virginia, adding up to over 1,100 megawatts. That’s great, but the company’s Virginia data centers are such energy hogs that they would need many times as much solar, plus a huge amount of battery storage to meet their 24/7 demand. And of course, Amazon’s demand will skyrocket with that next $35 billion in new data centers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That same map, by the way, shows that Amazon has on-site solar at warehouses and Whole Foods stores all over the Northeast, but none in Virginia. Northeastern states have higher commercial power rates than Virginia does, so on-site solar means bigger bill savings in those states. One cannot help but suspect that Amazon’s commitment to renewable energy is really just a commitment to cheap energy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Data Center Coalition’s </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7tyy01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the IRP case does nothing to reassure us otherwise. Instead of chiding Dominion for reneging on its clean energy commitments, the Coalition’s Josh Levi essentially argues data centers are so important it doesn’t matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no beef with data centers as a general proposition. They are an integral component of today’s economy, and the developments that now drive their explosive growth — machine learning and artificial intelligence — will also help us achieve a zero-carbon future. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just think data centers should try a little harder to be part of the solution instead of part of the problem.  </span></p>

It was like being hopelessly in debt: too upsetting to think about, so you may as well ignore it. But then </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/12/as-smoke-from-canada-enters-virginia-research-links-climate-change-with-more-frequent-wildfires/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smoke kept drifting down from Canadian wildfires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the planet experienced its </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/07/19/as-temperatures-rise-in-va-researchers-report-sparsely-located-cooling-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hottest days on record</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. People are dying of the heat across the American South and in Europe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s as if the debt collectors suddenly switched from sending threatening letters to sending goons with baseball bats. Alarm is not too strong a reaction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the goons have gotten your attention for the first time, you will want to acquaint yourself with the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The concise </span><a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary for Policymakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that accompanies the IPCC’s latest report can get you up to speed. Like sorting out shambled finances, though, it’s both boring and terrifying: Boring because mountains of scientific research inform conclusions couched in dry probabilities; terrifying because those conclusions are bleak. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humans have overloaded the atmosphere with so much carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gasses that further climate disruption is now unavoidable, no matter how fast we decarbonize. We are in for longer and more frequent heat waves, more extreme weather events, longer and more intense wildfire seasons, accelerating sea level rise, more people migrating to escape newly-uninhabitable lands, more loss of plant and animal species and the further spread of diseases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the plus side — oh wait, there isn’t a plus side. Not only is continued disruption inevitable, but if we were to continue business as usual, children born today would live to see New York and most other coastal cities underwater. Instead of 60,000 people dying from heat in a bad year, as happened </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02419-z" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Europe, the number worldwide could reach </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2021/oct/14/climate-change-happening-now-stats-graphs-maps-cop26" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">well into the millions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there are the possible </span><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tipping points</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would bring devastation suddenly rather than gradually, and in ways we aren’t prepared for. The latest prediction to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/climate/atlantic-ocean-tipping-point.html?campaign_id=190&amp;emc=edit_ufn_20230725&amp;instance_id=98415&amp;nl=from-the-times&amp;regi_id=51563885&amp;segment_id=140239&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=958583c35bc86acd87dfd6824669923f" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hit the news</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (though it has been discussed for years, with few people listening) is that meltwater from the Greenland ice sheet could force the powerful Atlantic Ocean current to stall sometime between 2025 (gah!) and 2095. That would make the tropics even hotter but send Europe into a deep freeze — a cure for their heat problems, but not the one they’re looking for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However dismal these scenarios may be, though, we are not dead yet. In spite of the best efforts of the fossil fuel industry, business will not continue as usual. Efforts to decarbonize our economy started late and are taking too long, but they are working, and they will only accelerate. Investment in the energy transition </span><a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/global-low-carbon-energy-technology-investment-surges-past-1-trillion-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">equaled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global investment in fossil fuels last year for the first time. In the course of this century, we will not just stop adding greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere, we’ll begin removing the excess. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The energy transition is just part of the changes ahead. We are in the early years of a golden age of invention that will make the 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century look like a mere prologue. By the time today’s toddlers reach old age, they will have witnessed transformational innovations in technology, housing, transportation, industry, materials, food and agriculture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I keep a running list of breakthrough inventions and new technologies that together could solve our climate problem many times over. They won’t all pan out, of course, and I’ve learned not to put too much stock in promising ideas backed only by early research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, something transformational could be in the mix that we don’t recognize yet. About 20 years ago I wrote a column mocking cell phones that could take grainy pictures as well as make calls, opining that only teenagers would pay $400 for such useless technology. Some ideas sputter and die, others change how we live.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is certain is that improvements in wind, solar, battery storage and electric vehicles will continue these technologies’ march to dominance, while fossil fuels become niche. Concerns about the land needs of renewable energy are overblown; you could power the entire U.S. with solar panels on just </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/35097.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-third</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the more than </span><a href="https://frontiergroup.org/resources/ethanols-outsized-place-us-energy-system/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30 million acres</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> currently devoted to growing corn for climate-unfriendly ethanol. Indeed, solar doesn’t even have to displace farming. </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/articles/potential-agrivoltaics-us-solar-industry-farmers-and-communities" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agrivoltaics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is already making solar and agriculture compatible and creating money-saving synergies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the near future, solar cells will be everywhere: on walls and windows as well as roofs, on top of electric </span><a href="https://sonomotors.com/en/press/press-releases/sono-motors-reaches-over-40m-payment-commitments-in-ongoing-savesion-campaign/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://energy.mit.edu/news/solar-cells-printed-on-paper/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">printed on paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  We will also have cheaper, safer, and longer-duration battery storage; already, </span><a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/us-utility-xcel-to-put-form-energys-100-hour-iron-air-battery-at-retiring-coal-power-plant-sites/?utm_medium=email" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hundred-hour batteries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are set for deployment in 2025. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://wonderfulengineering.com/this-new-contra-rotating-turbine-can-produce-double-the-energy-of-the-worlds-largest-turbine/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Innovative wind designs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also promise more power for less cost. Offshore wind, still just getting started in the U.S., will be sending power to the East Coast, the West Coast, and Gulf states by the end of this decade. Longer term, </span><a href="https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/8/725/2023/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">autonomous, unmoored, floating wind turbines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could guide themselves around the ocean, producing synthetic green fuels or performing direct-air carbon capture. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar progress is happening in all sectors of our economy. Artificial intelligence and machine learning will reduce costs and speed up the ongoing work on low-carbon solutions, including in materials and chemicals. Some futurists predict a revolution in food production that will have us all eating cheap, </span><a href="https://www.rethinkx.com/food-and-agriculture" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nutritious and tasty microbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> instead of animals by 2030 (yes, really), freeing up hundreds of millions of acres of agricultural land for reforestation and wildlife habitat. That seems like a tall order, but then again: cell phones with cameras.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look, I am not by nature an optimist. I wish I were; it’s obvious that optimists are happier than pessimists (or, as I like to call us, realists). Nor do I kid myself that humans will suddenly lose our tendencies to self-centeredness, greed and bigotry. We have the most astounding capacity for doing the wrong thing even when the right thing is standing there waving its arms frantically in the air and yelling, “Ooh, ooh! Choose me! Choose me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even this summer’s record heat won’t stop climate </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/13/is-there-a-partisan-divide-on-climate-not-among-young-people/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“skeptics” </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from insisting the climate is not changing, or as they say now, that “no one knows why” the planet is warming. They are dosing themselves with an attractive snake oil; who wouldn’t like to hope that Nature might defy physics and start cooling us off again, either on a whim or because she secretly works for Chevron? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let them have their snake oil. The rest of us have work to do.</span></p>

A rich sinner could buy “indulgences” to cover adultery, eating meat during Lent, or any number of other transgressions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The historical record does not indicate that emitting carbon dioxide was among the redeemable sins . (Well, CO2 wouldn’t be </span><a href="https://edu.rsc.org/resources/on-this-day-jun-11--carbon-dioxide-discovered/10611.article#:~:text=On%20This%20Day%20%E2%80%93%20June%2011,on%20this%20day%20in%201754" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discovered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> until 1754.) Still, medieval Christians would have recognized the attraction of buying indulgences in the form of carbon offsets rather than actually cutting back on CO2-emitting activities. We can’t help sinning, so if the act of atonement evens the score, why not grant absolution?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in the present, a whole industry has sprung up to sell climate indulgences to guilt-ridden liberals. As </span><a href="https://carbonfund.org/how-planting-trees-offsets-carbon/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> explains soothingly, “Carbon offsets work through supporting tree planting services and carbon offsetting projects to neutralize your emissions and mitigate your impact on the planet.” Buying these indulgences requires just a click of your mouse and a credit card. For $25 you can feel good about an airplane flight of up to 10,000 miles! That’s enough to get you from D.C. to Australia, where you can visit the Great Barrier Reef before it is completely destroyed by the </span><a href="https://www.barrierreef.org/uploads/Ocean%20Acidification%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ocean acidification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resulting from your carbon emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(I’ve committed this sin myself: I’ve been to Australia, on a miserably long flight the CO2 emissions of which I did not pay $25 to offset. They hadn’t invented $25 carbon offsets at the time, or I might have.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martin Luther, a 16th century priest who made a name for himself by opposing the selling of indulgences, put the matter succinctly:  “Indulgences are most pernicious,” </span><a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1902/medieval-indulgence--martin-luther/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “because they induce complacency and thereby imperil salvation.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He meant saving souls, and we mean saving the planet; regardless, he had the psychology right. We’re more likely to excuse ourselves for driving gas-guzzlers and flying to cool places if we also pay to plant trees in Africa or bribe Brazilians not to deforest the Amazon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sadly, that approach doesn’t work. By </span><a href="https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/how-many-new-trees-would-we-need-offset-our-carbon-emissions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one calculation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it would require planting at least 200 billion new trees to suck up the excess CO2 emissions of Americans alone. This assumes we don’t lose any trees to fire, drought, disease or clearing. And how’s that working out? As of the end of June, fires had already consumed </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/30/canada-wildfire-crisis-active-acres-record" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 million acres</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Canadian forest this year alone, in large part as a result of climate change. All the carbon those trees had stored up is now back in the atmosphere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t mean planting trees and saving the rainforest aren’t good works. They are. But there’s a high likelihood any carbon offsets you purchase will be among the 90% of rainforest offsets that a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guardian </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigation </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found were worthless</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet fear not, sinners! Great minds are at work to find effective ways to remove CO2 from the air or the ocean and squirrel it away more or less permanently. Some ideas now in the research or pilot stage involve capturing CO2 from industrial processes like </span><a href="https://www.carbonclean.com/industries/cement#:~:text=Carbon%20capture%20is%20a%20vital,deployed%20by%20leading%20cement%20companies." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cement manufacturing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or from </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage/direct-air-capture" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">direct-air capture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The CO2 is then injected underground or used as </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-industry/an-arizona-plant-will-pull-co2-from-the-air-and-trap-it-in-concrete?utm_campaign=canary&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=251254703&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8eiFiT1Gs7IpxNaFDuSdaH54zOt9Iu0bzQ199CY9jNSBBX91CLns8WUMT_miHJ8dMrtvdJA6P2Cyn21uicanKvlNJ_bdhTTJaZtmaxGGQLKnFuPkg&amp;utm_source=newsletter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an ingredient in concrete</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or other products. (</span><a href="https://arkeon.bio/5/?mkt_tok=MjExLU5KWS0xNjUAAAGJffUuAV3z-TUTmrqAxr1kldGc0N2uAWl-OtYlg1ztwcuM1jnJY_sT0K99DggbpF194_rGyavRdwdtDYXkgwblW-3pDBP2UVOvahFmqFLL8D3KqZM" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon-negative food</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, anyone?) Technologies that let nature do the heavy lifting include </span><a href="https://www.energymonitor.ai/tech/carbon-removal/speeding-up-rock-weathering-can-help-decarbonise-the-atmosphere/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spreading basalt rock dust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on farm fields as a soil amendment and using </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/19/volcanic-microbe-eats-co2-astonishingly-quickly-say-scientists?utm_medium=email" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">microbes to gobble up CO2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting more attention, likely </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06072023/carbon-capture-north-dakota/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">undeservedly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is the effort to capture and bury CO2 from fossil fuel power plant emissions. This isn’t carbon negative; it simply reduces the amount of CO2 that makes it out of the smokestack. Capturing CO2 where it is most abundant — right where coal and gas are burned — is more efficient than direct-air capture, but it’s expensive and energy-intensive. Shutting the plant and replacing it with renewable energy will almost always be the better option for the planet, and the cheaper one for whoever has to foot the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with generous subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), cost remains the biggest barrier to a market for effective carbon offsets. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects still can cost upwards of $400 per ton of CO2. In 2021 the U.S. Department of Energy launched what it calls its </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon Negative Shot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, aimed at reducing the price of removing 1 ton of CO2 from the atmosphere to $100 in 1 decade. That would put the price closer to the U.S. Government’s current estimate for the social cost of carbon of $51 per ton, and below the $185 that </span><a href="https://www.rff.org/news/press-releases/social-cost-of-carbon-more-than-triple-the-current-federal-estimate-new-study-finds/#:~:text=A%20multi%2Dyear%20study%20of,estimate%20of%20%2451%20per%20ton." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">might be the true cost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The market is potentially enormous. Aviation, shipping, steelmaking, chemical manufacturing and cement production are especially challenging to decarbonize. Consider that </span><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/decarbonization-challenge-for-steel" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steelmaking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generates about 1.85 tons of CO2 per ton of steel, and the industry produces </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1149/steel-industry/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">close to 2 billion tons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annually. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1186820/co2-emissions-commercial-aviation-worldwide/#:~:text=By%202019%2C%20the%20amount%20of,metric%20tons%20of%20CO2." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commercial aviation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generated 900 million tons of CO2 in 2019. According to this handy </span><a href="https://flightfree.org/flight-emissions-calculator" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flight calculator</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that’s about 2.2 tons of CO2 for every passenger flying round-trip from Virginia’s Dulles Airport to Paris, France. It’s no wonder the voluntary carbon-offset market is expected to become </span><a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/carbon-offset-market-growth#:~:text=Although%20many%20companies%20are%20working,around%20%24250%20billion%20by%202050." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $250 billion industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2050. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, let’s be real. Carbon-negative technology is only needed because we continue to flood the atmosphere with greenhouse gasses from activities we can mostly decarbonize at far less cost today. Money being thrown at expensive CCS or ineffective forest offsets would have a greater impact spent on weatherizing homes, putting </span><a href="https://give.solar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar on rooftops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/04/190408114017.htm#:~:text=New%20research%20shows%20that%20resources,options%20to%20support%20these%20instead." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building renewable energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in fossil fuel-dependent areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, buying renewable energy certificates can do this, too, but their effectiveness is </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/05/21/lots-of-renewable-options-for-energy-consumers-but-why-are-few-of-them-any-good/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questionable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in part because of the tendency of companies to use them for </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/opinions/we-must-move-on-from-recs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greenwashing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That is, they want carbon indulgences, but at a price that lets them continue business as usual. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medieval sinners would surely relate. </span></p>

On Thursday, June 8, 2023. Hundreds of frontline and Appalachian climate activists rallied against President Biden's endorsement of the Mountain Valley Pipeline. (POWHR/Eman Mohammed/Survival Media Agency)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This spring’s passage of federal legislation </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/29/us/politics/debt-ceiling-agreement.html#:~:text=Understand%20the%20Debt%20Limit%20Deal&amp;text=Lifting%20the%20debt%20ceiling.,pay%20its%20bills%20on%20time." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising the debt ceiling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> came with one provision that clean energy advocates had fought hard against: it sweeps away </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/09/whats-next-for-the-court-cases-challenging-mountain-valley-pipeline/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several legal challenges</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) that have stalled completion for more than four years. The pipeline is supposed to carry methane gas from the fracking fields of West Virginia into Virginia to connect to an existing interstate pipeline here, and getting it built has long been a priority of West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FDARL1YI2h"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/06/09/whats-next-for-the-court-cases-challenging-mountain-valley-pipeline/">What&#8217;s next for the court cases challenging Mountain Valley Pipeline?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchin surely believes he notched a victory with the inclusion of this provision in must-pass legislation. And in one respect, he’s right. Pipeline opponents </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/06/05/with-path-cleared-for-the-mountain-valley-pipeline-opponents-weigh-next-steps/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aren’t conceding defeat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but stopping the MVP in court just got a heck of a lot harder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the pipeline’s developers should be celebrating is another matter. The wisdom of building a new methane gas pipeline was questionable nine years ago when the MVP was conceived. Today, with the U.S. transitioning away from fossil fuels, the folly of building new gas infrastructure should be obvious to anyone who hasn’t already committed billions of dollars to the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy figured this out three years ago when it </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/05/dominion-cancels-atlantic-coast-pipeline-announces-sale-of-natural-gas-transmission-and-storage-assets/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Dominion is a big energy conglomerate and had other projects to pursue. Canceling the Atlantic Coast Pipeline saved it billions of dollars that it is now investing in offshore wind and other renewable energy assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP’s two largest minority partners are also diversified companies with other options. NextEra Energy, which owns a 31% share in the partnership through its subsidiary Next Energy Resources, wrote off the value of its investment in MVP in </span><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2021/01/26/next-era-mountain-valley-pipeline.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and 2022, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/nextera-takes-800-mln-charge-wv-va-mountain-valley-natgas-pipe-2022-02-19/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it planned to “reevaluate its investment in the Mountain Valley Pipeline.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A NextEra spokesperson did not answer my question about what the company plans to do about MVP now.  But if a picture is worth a thousand words, take a look at NextEra Energy Resources’ </span><a href="https://www.nexteraenergyresources.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homepage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. MVP isn’t mentioned anywhere on the website, which is largely a celebration of the company’s renewable energy assets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third-largest stakeholder in the MVP is Consolidated Edison, with an initial 12.5% stake. In 2019 it exercised an option to </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/trending/qbcDcDwOYH401occ1NGciA2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cap its investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in MVP, and in 2020 it </span><a href="https://investor.conedison.com/static-files/a5023f68-ea7b-4346-b42e-dbf224ea84e2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the value of its investment by almost half. ConEd CEO John McAvoy told investors that year the company </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/coned-may-sell-pipeline-stakes-as-it-reconsiders-gas-transmission-investments-60093361" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would no longer invest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in gas transmission projects and “certainly would” consider selling its stake in MVP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We made those investments five to seven years ago,” he said, “and at that time we — and frankly many others — viewed natural gas as having a fairly large role in the transition to the clean energy economy. That view has largely changed, and natural gas, while it can provide emissions reductions, is no longer &#8230; part of the longer-term view.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, these views aren’t shared by MVP’s majority owner and operator. Equitrans Midstream is solely a pipeline and gas storage company, having been spun off from a larger corporation, EQT, in 2018. MVP is its </span><a href="https://ir.equitransmidstream.com/news/news-details/2023/Equitrans-Midstream-Announces-First-Quarter-2023-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">key to growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The exit door may be wide open, but Equitrans doesn’t want to leave because it has nowhere to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t mean it makes sense to stay, either. Many a gambler has learned the hard way that continuing to feed coins into a slot machine does not make it more likely to disgorge the jackpot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And really, if there ever was a jackpot for MVP, it is gone by now. In 2015, EQT saw an opportunity to undercut the price charged by existing pipelines to ship gas to an energy-hungry Southeast. Today, though, demand for methane gas has cooled in the face of cheap wind and solar, while MVP’s costs have ballooned to $6.6 billion from the initial projection of $3.25 billion. Analysts say MVP’s competitive advantage has </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/natural-gas/032221-mountain-valley-pipelines-once-favorable-gas-economics-fall-amid-completion-hurdles" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evaporated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and its prospects for profitability </span><a href="https://ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Mountain-Valley-Pipeline-Faces-Uphill-Struggle-to-Financial-Viability_March-2021.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">look grim</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equitrans </span><a href="https://equitrans2018ipo.q4web.com/news/news-details/2023/Mountain-Valley-Pipeline-To-Proceed/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that there is still a pressing need for its pipeline, but demand has always been hypothetical. From the very beginning, the partnership seemingly indulged in “build it and they will come” magical thinking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting a permit to build from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requires that pipeline developers have their customers lined up ahead of time in order to demonstrate a “need” for the project. Even in 2015 there were not enough customers clamoring for MVP’s services, so the partners named themselves as the buyers for more than half of the pipeline’s capacity. FERC’s approach to permitting allows this self-dealing, though the commission has been </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/self-dealing-loophole-could-upend-ferc-pipeline-reviews/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, Equitrans was never going to be a customer; it isn’t in the business of generating power or selling gas at retail. Its field of dreams assumed demand for gas would grow, customers would be clamoring for pipeline capacity, and Equitrans would be able sell its share of the capacity and just reap the profits from owning the pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to imagine that happening now. Economics had already started to favor wind and solar over fossil fuels when the MVP broke ground. Total natural gas consumption has been </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n9140us2m.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly flat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nationwide since 2018, and the Energy Information Agency (EIA) </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/#/?id=1-AEO2023&amp;region=0-0&amp;cases=ref2023&amp;start=2021&amp;end=2050&amp;f=A&amp;linechart=~ref2023-d020623a.31-1-AEO2023&amp;map=&amp;ctype=linechart&amp;sid=&amp;sourcekey=0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it will decline steadily for the next decade. EIA also </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55419#:~:text=Developers%20plan%20to%20add%2054.5,Preliminary%20Monthly%20Electric%20Generator%20Inventory." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that more than half of all new electric generating capacity this year will be solar, with natural gas additions down to a mere 14%. Here in Virginia, methane gas burned by electric utilities has </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/n3045va2m.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a high in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future will only get brighter for renewables and dimmer for gas. In 2020, Virginia committed to a zero-carbon energy future, and in 2022 Congress passed the strongest set of clean energy incentives in history. Betting on fossil fuels in today’s environment makes no sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, Governor Youngkin is doing his level best to throw a wrench in the works, and Dominion Energy Virginia just </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/14/dominion-reviving-plans-to-build-a-natural-gas-peaker-plant-in-chesterfield/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=59f9a175-e623-4d19-b18d-accc86ad2c61" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building a 1,000-megawatt gas combustion turbine, citing growing demand from data centers and electric vehicles. Misguided as that proposal is, it doesn’t signal good times ahead for the gas industry. Combustion turbines are not baseload plants; they run only when demand exceeds other sources of supply. Dominion has no plans to build new baseload gas plants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MVP knows finding customers in Virginia will be hard. Before litigation and permit denials put construction on hold in 2018, the partnership had proposed an extension of the pipeline into North Carolina, perhaps hoping for better pickings in Duke Energy territory. Now that MVP has the congressional seal of approval, it is </span><a href="https://appvoices.org/2023/06/15/mvp-southgate-extension/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking to revive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the proposed Southgate Extension, to the dismay of </span><a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/article276318846.html?utm_medium=email" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Carolina activists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet economics don’t favor gas over solar there, either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">liquefied natural gas </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">export market has also been floated as a potential source of growth, but </span><a href="https://priceofoil.org/2023/05/26/mvp-is-not-energy-security/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">critics say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the lack of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">liquefied natural gas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> terminal capacity prevents that from happening.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s time to stop this travesty. Equitrans claims MVP is 94% complete, but </span><a href="https://appvoices.org/pipelines/mountain-valley-pipeline/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opponents say</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the true figure is more like 56%, with many of the most difficult segments (like stream crossings) still to be tackled. Those are also the most environmentally sensitive parts of the line. Pulling the plug on MVP now would avoid not only the cost of completing the pipeline, but also the cost of fixing leaks, erosion damage and other problems critics believe are inevitable given the terrain and geology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would be a much better result for everyone concerned than completing the pipeline to serve a market that doesn’t exist – a Pyrrhic victory if there ever was one.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging from the political rhetoric, you’d be justified in thinking that only Democrats feel the urgency of the climate crisis, while Republicans are united in dismissing it. Polling shows Democrats are better aligned with popular sentiment: the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/inflation-biden-technology-trending-news-government-and-politics-e734337636b6dba18840649e3c9db73b" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">great majority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Americans support more climate action. But Republican leaders assume that even if their position is a losing one  with the general population, at least they represent their party membership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turns out they are ignoring critical details. The divide they should be paying attention to is not between Democrats and Republicans. It’s between</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/31/virginias-youth-can-influence-policy-are-legislators-ready-to-listen/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> young people</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and old Republicans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/18/for-earth-day-key-facts-about-americans-views-of-climate-change-and-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Pew Research Center found that although 64% of Republicans over 65 oppose the U.S. taking steps to become carbon neutral, 67% of Republicans under 30 support</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">doing so. Given that Millennials and members of Gen Z (those born after 1997) are less likely to identify as Republicans in the first place, you’d think the party leadership would pay close attention to the issues young Republicans care about, in hopes of growing their brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, the party’s position on climate is driven by the opinions of the older, mostly white Republicans who dominate the conservative media echo chamber and control power in Congress and state legislatures. In Virginia, as in </span><a href="https://www.ncsl.org/about-state-legislatures/state-legislator-demographics" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/118th-congress-age-third-oldest-1789-rcna64117" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawmakers are </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/visuals/visual/how-representative-are-virginias-representatives-2018/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">older, whiter and more male</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the people they represent. They can afford to dismiss climate change, because the worst impacts won’t happen until they have disappeared from the planet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that tendency of older voters to die off is exactly why catering to the curmudgeon bloc is a bad strategy for holding on to power in the long term. </span><a href="https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenhouse gas concentrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> continue to increase; the planet </span><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keeps warming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/06/12/as-smoke-from-canada-enters-virginia-research-links-climate-change-with-more-frequent-wildfires/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choking smoke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Canadian fires is merely a warning of what lies ahead.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nothing-to-see-here narrative on climate change will only appear more fringe with every record wildfire season, every killer heat wave and every freak mega-storm. If Republicans don’t find a way to pivot, they will continue losing younger voters until they find themselves out of power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s actually the best-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario, Republicans win the presidency and Congress and, having backed themselves into a corner pandering to the curmudgeons, will feel forced to undo recent federal climate legislation including the Inflation Reduction Act. Consequences for the planet and the American economy would be disastrous. The IRA is not just the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/17/iea-chief-says-ira-most-important-climate-agreement-since-paris-accord.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most impactful climate law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the U.S. has ever passed, it has unleashed enormous infusions of capital </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/23/red-states-are-winning-big-from-dems-climate-law-00078420" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">into red states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what demographic benefits most from the millions of new jobs being created in green energy and electric vehicles? Why, that would be the young people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Republicans in Congress and state legislatures do recognize the climate is in crisis. Behind closed doors, they may even concede their party needs to do more. But each lawmaker has a different excuse for failing to act. They fear a primary challenge from someone even farther to the right, or they depend on donations from fossil fuel apologists like the Koch brothers (again, old white men!), or they fear retribution from party leaders if they buck their caucus. In the end, they fall back on obfuscation, deflection, Democrat-blaming and wishful thinking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent news stories have featured much wringing of hands and pointing of fingers over Gen Z’s tendency towards pessimism and nihilism. Surveys show these young people are more likely to believe it is </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1308707/attitude-towards-climate-action-by-generation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">too late</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to avert climate change, and more than half feel “</span><a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/for-gen-z-climate-change-is-a-heavy-emotional-burden" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">humanity is doomed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Close to 40% say their fears about the future make them reluctant to have children. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many young people are channeling their anxiety and anger into action. Election turnout among younger voters </span><a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/2022-election-center" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has surged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though it’s still woefully behind that of older generations. Young workers are more likely to seek </span><a href="https://time.com/6176169/what-young-workers-want-in-jobs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jobs with a positive impact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for people and the planet — which makes the green job incentives in the IRA all the more relevant to their lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the good news for this generation is that the urgency of the climate crisis has spurred a remarkable acceleration of research and development into climate solutions. For young workers especially, there are more opportunities for meaningful work than at any time in history. The kids are right to worry about hard times ahead, but their generation may be the one to save humanity from this crisis of their elders’ making. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Success, however, requires that those elders acknowledge the crisis, find the courage to move past partisan politics, and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">help</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

(Vicki Jauron, Babylon and Beyond Photography via Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might know them as bunker or pogies. Landlubbers might not know them at all. Menhaden, a kind of herring that has been called </span><a href="https://www.cbf.org/about-the-bay/more-than-just-the-bay/chesapeake-wildlife/menhaden/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the most important fish in the sea</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, are a keystone species in the Atlantic, serving both as a critical food source for predatory fish, marine mammals and birds, and as a consumer of vast quantities of algae that would otherwise clog waterways and shade out underwater vegetation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the Chesapeake Bay, people know them as the victim of corporate greed and Virginia politics, both sadly familiar topics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Menhaden have supported one of the East Coast’s largest fisheries since colonial times. They once supplied “reduction factories” up and down the coast, where every year hundreds of millions of the bony little fish were cooked and ground up to make lamp oil and fertilizer. Today, in addition to fertilizer, they are turned into cat food, health supplements and feed for farmed salmon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as </span><a href="https://www.eqrllc.com/post/the-most-important-fish-in-the-sea" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the 19</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, overfishing caused the population to decline, and it’s been a cycle of boom and bust ever since. One by one, all the Atlantic states but one banned reduction factories and fishing for the reduction industry in their state waters, protecting the bays and estuaries where the immature fish live for their first year or two before heading into the ocean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one outlier is Virginia. The last reduction factory on the East Coast is located in Reedville, Virginia, providing jobs for about 250 local workers. But this is hardly a sleepy little local business. The operation is owned by Omega Protein Corporation, which in turn is owned by a Canadian multinational, Cooke Inc. Omega’s fishing vessels use 1,500-foot-long purse seine nets to harvest hundreds of millions of pounds of menhaden every year. The fish are processed at the Reedville factory and then shipped out to Omega’s other business operations around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, in the face of </span><a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/fact-sheets/2012/11/08/missing-menhaden" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plummeting numbers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of menhaden blamed on Omega’s operations, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) took on the regulation of menhaden fishing. Today the ASMFC </span><a href="http://www.asmfc.org/species/atlantic-menhaden" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allocates catch levels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  among the states, but in a way that locks in Omega’s outsized share of the fishery. Virginia’s — that is, Omega’s — quota is 75% of the total. The other 14 states in the compact share the last 25%, enough to supply bait for local crabbers, fishermen and lobstermen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is an exception in other ways, too. Not only is Omega permitted to operate in state waters along the Virginia coast, which no other Atlantic state allows, Virginia also lets Omega’s vessels fish in the Chesapeake Bay. In fact, Omega is currently allowed to take </span><a href="https://mrc.virginia.gov/Regulations/MRC_Scanned_Regs/FINFISH/FR1270_03-03-23.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">112 million pounds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (51,000 metric tons) of menhaden out of Virginia’s side of the Chesapeake Bay every year, about a third of Virginia’s total quota. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maryland doesn’t allow Omega to operate on its side of the Chesapeake, and it very much wishes Virginia wouldn’t either. Young fish have to survive the trip through the Virginia side to reach the ocean, where the adults spend most of their lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty much everyone else who depends on the bay for recreation or their livelihood also wishes Virginia would keep Omega out of the Chesapeake. The bay’s health is famously precarious. Many of its fish and birds that depend on menhaden for food are in decline, including </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/issues/whats-at-risk/striped-bass#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20overfishing%2C%20a,in%20prey%20abundance%20and%20disease." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">striped bass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (rockfish) and </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/science-technology/2017-09-14/bays-osprey-population-in-decline-again" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">osprey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The declines threaten economic mainstays like the recreational striped bass fishery, which generates an </span><a href="https://www.cbf.org/issues/what-we-have-to-lose/economic-importance-of-the-bay/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $500 million annually in economic activity. </span><a href="https://easternshorepost.com/2022/07/29/it-stinks-another-fish-spill/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents also complain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Omega’s “fish spills,” where torn nets result in beaches covered with thousands of dead menhaden and bycatch including red drum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Omega prefers to fish in the protected waters of the Chesapeake over the rougher open ocean, or even in coastal waters outside the bay. Fishing in the Chesapeake allows Omega to reach its overall quota faster and at less expense to itself. The bay’s loss is, decidedly, Omega’s gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Omega is grateful to Virginia, or at least to its lawmakers. Every year it presents Virginia politicians with generous </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/137690-omega-protein/?start_year=all&amp;end_year=all" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">donations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Each incoming governor’s inaugural committee, regardless of party, gets $25,000. Favored legislators receive thousands of dollars in campaign contributions. Senator Richard Stuart, R-Westmoreland is the top recipient, but in the fine tradition of Virginia corporate palm-greasing, Omega has contributed to dozens of other legislators from both parties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years Omega’s friends ensured that the General Assembly, rather than a regulatory agency, directly “oversaw” the menhaden fishery, by which I mean </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/17/menhaden-have-plagued-lawmakers-for-decades-why-were-they-able-to-find-a-fix-this-year/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it did not interfere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2020, however, the General Assembly finally passed </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1448" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> giving oversight of menhaden to the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That change has not produced the tighter regulations advocates hoped for. Corporate political power in Virginia has a half-life rivaling that of nuclear waste; besides, fishing interests control the VMRC. There are no representatives from the environmental community on its board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But advocates keep trying. Last fall the Virginia Saltwater Sportfishing Association </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/27/sportfishing-group-presents-petition-to-move-omega-protein-out-of-chesapeake-bay/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission with a petition asking for a ban on menhaden fishing in the Chesapeake Bay. Instead, the VMRC </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/07/virginia-regulators-enter-into-agreement-with-menhaden-fishery/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a memorandum of understanding with Omega that keeps fishing vessels a mile from shore inside the bay. The agreement, which has no force of law, is expected to lessen the likelihood of fish spills but will not reduce Omega’s catch limit, much less kick its vessels out of the bay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two weeks ago, the Chesapeake Legal Alliance </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/10/lawsuit-says-virginia-menhaden-regulators-unlawfully-increased-catch-limit/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the VMRC on behalf of the Southern Mar</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">yland Recreational Fishing Organization, claiming VMRC “rubber-stamped” a higher quota set by the AMSFC without making its own determination of what effect higher catch limits would have on the fishery. The Alliance also argued that VMRC acted outside the statutory window of time for adjusting catch limits — a provision that, ironically, was added to the law at the behest of Omega. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact is, no one actually knows what effect Omega’s industrial fishing operation has on the Chesapeake Bay because the bay has never been given a chance to heal from centuries of exploitation. Menhaden stocks are healthy along the Atlantic coast, thanks to fishing quotas and the actions of other states to protect nurseries like the Delaware Bay. But in the Chesapeake Bay, the assault of industrial reduction fishing goes on unchecked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year Delegate Tim Anderson, R-Virginia Beach, introduced a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1383" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have paused menhaden reduction fishing in the bay for two years to allow the Department of Environmental Quality to conduct a study; the bill was tabled in committee. Another of Anderson’s bills would have prohibited foreign-owned corporations from making political contributions; </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1648" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was killed in subcommittee.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omega’s influence on the General Assembly is surely popular in Reedville (pop. 2,222), and no doubt it’s politics as usual in Richmond, but the rest of us should be angry. The Chesapeake Bay is far too precious a resource to let one Canadian company strip it of 112 million pounds of a keystone fish species every year, simply because it is cheaper for them to net the young menhaden in the bay than to have to gather the fish in the ocean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one is trying to put Omega’s Virginia employees out of work. But we should certainly put Omega out of the Chesapeake Bay.</span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last December, Dominion Energy produced a remarkable document: a </span><a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/-/media/pdfs/global/company/esg/2022-climate-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">climate report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> predicting that by 2040 its electricity supply will be </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/06/dominion-energys-climate-report-confirms-the-future-of-power-is-renewable/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dominated by renewable energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Coal will be gone by 2030, and methane gas will hang around in ever-smaller amounts, just to fill in the energy gaps. Small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) probably won’t play a role for at least 15 years, during which time solar will become the mainstay of the electricity supply. According to the report, this strategy will allow Dominion to meet its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast forward a few months, and the same company, using the same information, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/05/03/dominion-projects-new-gas-plants-advanced-nuclear-will-be-needed-to-meet-soaring-demand/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a future full of new methane-burning plants and SMRs. Dominion Energy Virginia’s 2023 </span><a href="https://cdn-dominionenergy-prd-001.azureedge.net/-/media/pdfs/global/company/2023-va-integrated-resource-plan.pdf?la=en&amp;rev=8e5047ba283b4b9bb5e17c41b3544564" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integrated Resource Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IRP), released May 1, now insists that the phenomenal growth of the data center industry and, to a lesser degree, the adoption of electric vehicles require so much energy that it can’t possibly meet legally-mandated climate goals. Accordingly, the plan doesn’t even try.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of decarbonizing in accordance with Virginia’s role in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the requirements of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), Dominion now says it must build new methane-burning plants and keep old, expensive coal plants running “beyond statutory retirement deadlines established in the VCEA.”  All the alternatives examined in the IRP “assume that Virginia exits the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (‘RGGI’) before January 1, 2024,” in violation of Virginia law. Most of the alternatives include the same SMRs its Climate Report recognized as unready. Compared to Dominion’s </span><a href="https://cdn-dominionenergy-prd-001.azureedge.net/-/media/pdfs/global/company/2022-va-integrated-resource-plan.pdf?la=en&amp;rev=4549a78d3a3a49fdb4850432fbdc9492" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 IRP update</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (filed just last September!), now costs have ballooned and CO2 emissions will skyrocket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What could possibly have happened in the course of a few months to produce this about-face? The astounding growth projections for the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/15/building-more-virginia-data-centers-requires-increased-pollution-controls/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data center industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may be news to many Virginians, but not to the utility that provides their power. Vehicle electrification is hardly a surprise either. SMRs did not achieve any breakthroughs in technology or economics this winter, nor did anyone suddenly discover a way for new gas plants to make sense for the climate or ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did happen was the 2023 General Assembly session, in which Gov. Glenn Youngkin played a decisive role in handing Dominion a major – and unaccustomed – defeat. With Dominion Energy holding its shareholder meeting today, the company badly needs to show it is back in the governor’s good graces. And the governor, as we know, is </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/18/you-call-that-an-energy-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not a fan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the energy transition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the IRP is a political document, not a serious approach to meeting Virginia’s electricity needs, at a time when climate change is accelerating and fossil fuels are giving way to superior renewable energy technologies.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market watchers will recall that Dominion’s stock price tanked in the fall of 2022, losing more than 30% of its value from August to November. So the company came up with a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1770" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have </span><a href="https://www.energyandpolicy.org/dominion-energy-funded-legislators-push-bill-to-boost-the-utilitys-profits/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increased the profit margin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for its Virginia utility from 9.35% to 10.77%. This number was calculated to improve Dominion’s standing on Wall Street but would cost consumers an extra $4 billion, according to the State Corporation Commission’s estimate. The company also expected to be able to defeat </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1604" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pro-consumer legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would return more authority over rates to the SCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s bill was widely panned, but that hardly made it a non-starter. In past years, the company has gotten what it wanted more often than not, thanks to powerful friends like Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, and House Majority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott. This is the beauty of doing business in a state that allows corporations, even public utilities, to supply unlimited campaign donations to elected officials. Over the years, Dominion’s contributions to Republican </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/candidates/270/top_donors/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kilgore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nearly match its contributions to Democrat </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/committees/125624/top_donors/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saslaw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Most other General Assembly members get contributions from Dominion, too, helping to cement bipartisan support for the company’s priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the patrons of this year’s money bill, Saslaw and Kilgore should have been able to deliver enough votes from members of both parties to ensure a profitable outcome for their biggest campaign donor. They were not counting on the governor poking holes in the plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s beating this year </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/24/virginia-youngkin-dominion-energy-assembly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grew from seeds it sowed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021. That year, Dominion made a bad bet on Democrat Terry MacAuliffe to win the governorship, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/dominion-energy-gave-200k-to-secretive-pac-attacking-youngkin-from-the-right/article_b694b095-fa0c-5966-ba06-5c49663a4a46.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">secretly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding a dark money group to run ads attacking Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, Youngkin took his revenge. As a Wall Street guy himself, he knows how to hit a corporation where it hurts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin forced Dominion to accept </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/25/general-assembly-deal-sets-dominion-profits-for-two-years-while-overhauling-regulatory-system/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changes to the bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that increase the company’s return on equity modestly (and only temporarily), but take away other avenues of profit. Adding insult to injury, the General Assembly also </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/21/legislation-aimed-at-restoring-regulators-authority-to-set-electric-rates-headed-to-youngkin/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the pro-consumer legislation that allows the SCC to set “fair and reasonable” rates in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/25/general-assembly-deal-sets-dominion-profits-for-two-years-while-overhauling-regulatory-system/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared itself satisfied</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the result, but Wall Street judged otherwise. The company’s stock, which had started to rally in January, reached a ten-year low this spring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from punishing Dominion, the governor achieved none of his energy goals in the legislative session. Rolling back the VCEA, exiting RGGI through legislation, reversing the Clean Car Standard — </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/02/a-dog-a-food-fight-and-other-energy-highlights-from-the-2023-general-assembly-session/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">none of that happened</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And as long as the Democrats keep control of at least one chamber in the General Assembly in this fall’s election, none of that is likely to happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Dominion’s IRP violates Virginia’s laws and the public’s trust (such as it is), makes a mockery of its own climate plan and proposes “solutions” that will drive up both costs and carbon emissions. As a plan, it can’t be taken seriously.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that, however, is beside the point. It </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/may/name-1002282-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">makes the governor happy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And what makes the governor happy, Dominion hopes, will make its shareholders happy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That assumes the shareholders don’t care about climate change, or that they hold values that are as malleable as those of Dominion CEO Bob Blue and the rest of the company’s leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate change? What climate change?</span></p>

Spurred by the urgency of the climate crisis, and attracted by generous incentives in last year’s Inflation Reduction Act, companies ranging from </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-19/big-oil-bets-that-green-hydrogen-is-the-future-of-energy?cmpid=BBD041823_GREENDAILY&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=230418&amp;utm_campaign=greendaily" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oil majors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to small start-ups are pouring money into the Next Big Thing in energy: a fuel that is flexible, transportable and carbon-free. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is hydrogen a critical piece of the decarbonization puzzle that needs floods of new funding, or an over-hyped, not-ready-for-prime-time financial boondoggle? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point the answer seems to be both. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his </span><a href="https://energy.virginia.gov/energy-efficiency/documents/2022_Virginia_Energy_Plan.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 Energy Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin touted hydrogen as “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reimagine Virginia’s future and meet energy needs through an abundant, dispatchable, and zero-emission fuel source where water is the only required input.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This statement has its problems, including the fact that water is actually not the only required input. Making hydrogen from water requires a lot of energy, which must come from some other fuel. Therein lies the rub. </span></p>

(U.S. Department of Energy) <span style="font-size: 16px;"> </span></p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to make hydrogen — and the method everyone is talking about — is using electricity to split water (H2O) into its components, hydrogen and oxygen, through </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-electrolysis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electrolysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span>Energy is lost in the process, so there is no point in using hydrogen for anything that can plug into the grid. Hydrogen is also more expensive and less efficient than battery storage, which explains why automakers are focusing on electric vehicles rather than ones that run on </span><a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/stories/2020/03/battery-or-fuel-cell--that-is-the-question.html" target="_blank"><span>hydrogen fuel cells</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet some kinds of transportation (aviation, long-haul trucking) and many industrial processes are hard or impossible to electrify, at least for now. Hydrogen, </span><a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/from-fertilizer-to-fuel-can-green-ammonia-be-a-climate-fix" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ammonia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other products can often replace fossil fuels for these uses, and perhaps also play a role in long-term energy storage for grid power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing this potential, last year’s Inflation Reduction Act included a range of </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/financial-incentives-hydrogen-and-fuel-cell-projects" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incentives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to spur investment in so-called green hydrogen, defined as hydrogen made from renewable energy. Growing the supply of green hydrogen will require a massive buildout of wind and solar as well as years of technological refinement, but </span><a href="https://www.airbus.com/en/innovation/zero-emission-journey/hydrogen" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">airlines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.h2greensteel.com/latestnews/bilstein-group-reduces-co2-footprint-through-deal-with-h2-green-steel-that-exceeds-250-millionnbspnbsp" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steelmakers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other customers are already either starting to use green hydrogen or say they want it for their operations.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, any time the government dangles a subsidy, some businesses will look to exploit any opening to grab free money, even if the result is contrary to the whole point of the subsidy. Those businesses do find champions among politicians who are more interested in generating economic activity than in making sound public policy (or maybe they just confuse the two). But getting the rules right is critical for the climate, and for making sure customers get the carbon-free product they sign up for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydrogen is already used in many industrial processes and in the manufacture of fertilizers but today it is mostly made from methane gas, at half the cost of green hydrogen. Oil companies like Chevron have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ceraweek-big-oil-hydrogen-forget-rainbow-just-make-it-profitable-2023-03-08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ceraweek-big-oil-hydrogen-forget-rainbow-just-make-it-profitable-2023-03-08/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1682452300722000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1XgcXCaqtJxPRYIj57EC6d">urged</a> that to build the market quickly, making hydrogen green is “secondary” to making it affordable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is all wrong. The great promise of hydrogen is the potential to make it from renewable energy once wind and solar have scaled up so much that there is a glut of cheap, emissions-free power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is not the situation today. </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fossil fuels make up 60% of electricity generation, with all renewables together representing 21.5%. The regional grid that serves Virginia includes </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/markets-and-operations.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than 10% wind and solar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the generation mix. Renewables are growing fast while coal shrinks, but few states have so much renewable energy that some of it occasionally goes to waste. </span><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/04/20/driven-by-solar-californias-net-demand-hit-zero-on-sunday/?utm_source=USA+%7C+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=eafe4de603-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_80e0d17bb8-eafe4de603-159072305" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">California</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has experienced this under ideal conditions, and is likely to be the first to have surplus renewable energy on a predictable basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenge is that a company that invests in the capital costs of a hydrogen production facility may not want to run it only when there is surplus wind and solar. These companies will make the most money by running their electrolyzers around the clock; profitability might even depend on it. Their choices are to build new renewable energy and battery storage for their own purposes and cut back production when they have to, or manipulate the rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So as the U.S. Treasury Department writes the rules around eligibility for green hydrogen incentives, corporate America is asking for loopholes. NextEra, the world’s largest renewable power generator, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ceraweek-big-oil-hydrogen-forget-rainbow-just-make-it-profitable-2023-03-08/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wants to be allowed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to use fossil fuels to fill in whenever there isn’t enough wind or solar energy on the grid, without losing the “green” designation and all the subsidies that accompany it. The company proposes buying carbon credits as an offset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal makes climate advocates very uneasy. We have seen this movie before. When the federal government first offered subsidies for ethanol made from corn in the 1970s, the idea was that blending American-made ethanol into gasoline would reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lower greenhouse gas emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty years later, the program still consumes some 30 million acres of corn every year, and is estimated to have cost taxpayers </span><a href="https://www.taxpayer.net/energy-natural-resources/understanding-u-s-corn-ethanol-and-other-corn-based-biofuels-subsidies/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">billions of dollars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all while </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16022022/corn-ethanol-gasoline-climate-change/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">actually harming the climate.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But just try scaling back ethanol subsidies today. Any politician who proposes such a thing gets their head handed to them by the powerful farm lobby. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That makes it really important that rules set into place today for hydrogen and other “green” fuels do not compromise on the requirement that they be made from carbon-free sources. Make an exception once, and we’ll never close the loophole.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s first commercial offshore wind farm is on track to start construction next year and to be fully operational in 2026.  The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project being developed by Dominion Energy will be the single largest offshore wind farm in the U.S. and among the first full-scale commercial wind projects built in U.S. waters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet it has taken us 10 years to get this far. Future projects will have shorter timelines now that the industry is gaining its footing and government bodies have figured out how to regulate it. Even so, the complexity of planning, permitting and building giant wind turbines 25 miles out in the ocean means Virginia needs to start planning the next project now to ensure that the supply chain businesses that have located here, and the workers we are training to build CVOW, still have reason to remain in Virginia come 2027. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most Virginians, offshore wind may still feel experimental because it has produced only two small projects in the U.S.: a 5-turbine wind farm off of Rhode Island’s Block Island built in 2016 and a two-turbine pilot project 27 miles out from Virginia Beach that started generating power in 2020. But at least 30 other projects are underway up and down the East Coast, including one currently under construction off </span><a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/vineyardwind-1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Massachusetts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and another off of </span><a href="https://www.offshorewind.biz/2023/04/04/us-issues-first-turbine-installation-clearance-for-commercial-scale-offshore-wind-farm/'" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will begin construction this year. Plans are also underway for wind farms in the Great Lakes, off the West Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together these projects add up to more than 53,000 megawatts (MW), exceeding the Biden Administration’s 30,000 MW by 2030 goal – enough to power 10 million homes with clean, renewable energy. </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-09/offshore-wind-market-report-2022-v2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the U.S. Department of Energy, independent forecasts show that goal to be solidly realistic. The U.S. offshore wind industry itself recently announced a longer-term target of 110,000 MW, reflecting the business community’s expectations for growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industry is also far more mature in other parts of the world. Global capacity passed the </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-08/offshore_wind_market_report_2022_executive_summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50,000 MW milestone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, and the global pipeline stands at more than 368,000 MW. (Surprise, surprise: China is eating our lunch, installing 13,790 MW in 2021 alone.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the most compelling evidence for the promise of the offshore wind industry in the U.S. is the size of industry events. In the course of a dozen years, U.S. offshore wind conferences have gone from gatherings of a few hundred academics, environmentalists and entrepreneurs in a hotel ballroom to the nearly 4,000 business people and hundreds of exhibitors who packed the Baltimore convention center at the end of March for the </span><a href="https://www.offshorewindus.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business Network for Offshore Wind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s International Offshore Wind Partnering Forum (IPF).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often the governor of a state hosting one of these annual conferences uses the occasion to unveil new goals or infrastructure investments; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore did not miss his chance this year. He announced that Maryland plans to develop 8,500 MW once the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management makes new lease areas available, a goal behind only New Jersey’s 11,000 MW target and New York’s 9,000 MW. Virginia’s goal begins to look cautious by comparison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The industry does face challenges. Inflation and supply chain issues have disrupted timelines and threatened profitability. There aren’t enough workers. Transmission constraints hinder the ability to get power to customers. Permitting is a pain in the neck. Here in the mid-Atlantic, it’s hard to identify new areas of the ocean suitable for wind farms, in large part because the Department of Defense wants it all for itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other challenges are more of the good kind, such as the fact that wind turbine sizes are increasing faster than ships capable of transporting and installing them can be built. Larger turbines mean more power at less cost, and no one is quite sure what the upper size limit might be. On land, the difficulty of transporting blades that can be the length of a football field means turbines are limited to about 3 MW. Fabricating parts at coastal facilities allows turbines to scale up as far as physics and advanced material manufacturing allow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion installed 6-MW turbines for its pilot project, which was seen as the new standard a few years ago. Today the company plans to use 15-MW turbines. Each one of these massive turbines is </span><a href="https://electrek.co/2023/04/03/worlds-most-powerful-wind-turbine-vestas-2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said to produce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enough energy to power 20,000 European households. I have not seen that figure translated into U.S. suburban McMansions, but it is still an eye-popping amount of emissions-free power from a single structure.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, and Dominion handled the installation ship issue by building </span><a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/projects-and-facilities/wind-power-facilities-and-projects/charybdis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its own vessel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which it will rent out for the Massachusetts and New York projects until it is needed for Virginia’s and others in the queue. Problem solved, at least for Virginia, though the industry needs many more ships.  </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Will the cost of energy come down? </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s CVOW project has been criticized for its high overall cost, largely the result of our immature domestic industry. The Biden Administration has set a goal to lower costs by one-third by 2030. If history is any indication, this should be readily achievable. A National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/84774.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows costs have fallen by more than half since 2016, and projects that by 2030, the levelized cost of energy from offshore wind turbines will fall by another third.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scaling up turbines to capture more wind energy is one approach to bringing the per-kilowatt-hour price down. Economies of scale, a U.S. supply chain, and a range of innovative technologies are all expected to contribute. And of course, the Inflation Reduction Act, with its tax credits for domestic manufacturing and renewable energy, is creating a gold rush of sorts, as companies compete to get a piece of the action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another significant factor in reducing costs is automation and machine learning. Some of the gains are incremental, such as optimizing turbine operation and improving turbine siting through improved wind and wake modeling. Other advances seem like windows into a future where robots take charge. Multiple exhibitor booths at IPF displayed crewless, self-piloting survey and depth-monitoring vessels and underwater robots capable of doing more tasks than humans can. Biologists and geologists stay comfortably ashore while on-board computers collect information at sea around the clock and send the data back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s innovation will inform the next great leap forward for the industry: floating wind turbines that open deep water to energy production. Right now, floating turbines must be tethered to the seafloor  and connected to cables to bring power to shore. For various reasons this technology is more expensive than fixed-foundation turbines, but here, too, the industry expects to become competitive in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people are thinking much bigger. Walt Musial, a principal engineer at NREL who is one of the top researchers in the field, gave an IPF audience a look into the future. There, automation and AI could make it possible for unmoored, cableless turbines to pilot themselves around the oceans, chasing the best winds, avoiding hurricanes and turning electricity into liquid fuels like ammonia to drop off at ports of call or offshore “energy islands.”  Musial even referred to these turbines as “vessels,” evoking a whole new kind of wind-powered transportation.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34913" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_7453-scaled.jpeg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-34913" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_7453-scaled.jpeg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_7453-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_7453-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_7453-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_7453-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_7453-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/IMG_7453-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A display at the Business Network for Offshore Wind&#8217;s IPF conference exhibits an autonomous wind turbine that could contribute to the nation&#8217;s future wind energy capacity.

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">It&#8217;s a great time for workers entering the industry — if you can find them </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though un-crewed, AI-directed traveling wind turbines may be the future, the present still requires foundations, cables, service vessels and, especially, a large workforce. Attracting and training an offshore wind workforce has become such an urgent issue that the topic earned its own track at IPF. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To its credit, this heavily male, heavily white-dominated industry says it is committed to recruiting a diverse workforce and ensuring equitable development of offshore wind, also a goal of the Biden Administration. It will have to; right now, no one has enough workers, so finding them means recruiting from overlooked communities and addressing the social and economic barriers that have kept many people out of the skilled labor force. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not new to other large infrastructure projects, </span><a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/in-your-community-2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Community Benefit Agreements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with detailed commitments covering local job creation and other investments, are new for offshore wind. Dominion has not entered any such agreement in Virginia, but as part of its case before the State Corporation Commission last fall in which it received permission to proceed with CVOW, the company signed a stipulation agreeing to an extensive and diverse community outreach program. Eileen Woll, Offshore Energy Program Director for the Sierra Club’s Virginia Chapter, told me Dominion is following through on this pledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Woll is also part of a task force made up of academic and community groups from the Hampton Roads area that has developed a plan for community engagement and outreach to identify potential workers from harder-to-reach demographic groups. She told me the “Breaking Barriers” project team has applied for a $500,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Energy to fund their work.  </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Halting steps towards Virginia’s next project </h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Clean Economy Act made special provision for Dominion’s CVOW project as part of an overall target of 5,200 MW. If CVOW makes up 2,600 MW, where will the rest come from? A project under development off Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, would connect to the grid in Virginia Beach, but Dominion has shown no interest in buying the power; nor has Duke Energy. Dominion makes more money acting as its own developer. Huge energy users like the data centers operated by Amazon Web Services in Virginia could absorb all the energy from several Kitty Hawks, but Amazon hasn’t stepped up either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has </span><a href="https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/press-releases/boem-identifies-draft-wind-energy-areas-central-atlantic-public-review-and" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 1.7 million acres offshore North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland and Delaware with potential for new leasing. The challenge is to make space for wind in an area already claimed by fishing interests, the Coast Guard, and the Department of Defense. If Virginia leaders are serious about building an enduring offshore wind industry here, they will have to engage in some tough negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Gov. Glenn Youngkin seems to be trying to ensure that the next Virginia project will be subject to competitive bidding to avoid a repeat of the process that made Dominion Energy the sole developer and holder of the only Virginia lease area. The governor amended an offshore wind </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1441" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, that was something of a nothingburger as passed by the General Assembly. Youngkin’s amendment turns the legislation into a plan requiring Dominion to work with the State Corporation Commission and other government agencies on a competitive solicitation process for the next offshore wind project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no guarantee that this will work, given that BOEM awards leases to high bidders. But if BOEM offers multiple wind energy areas for lease near Virginia, and awards the leases to multiple developers, then an SCC-led competitive process seems feasible, with a better result for consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor’s language may have been inspired by a House </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1854" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from De Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, that would have had the SCC study the ownership structure of offshore wind projects and report on how to achieve the best outcome for consumers. Republicans killed that bill, but presumably they will be more open to promoting competition when the idea comes from their own party. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly will consider the governor’s amendment when it reconvenes on April 12. Let’s hope his amendment indicates that Youngkin is ready and willing to start the next phase of Virginia’s offshore wind industry. </span></p>

(Getty Images) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of the political fight over Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is a seemingly simple question: does a requirement that Virginia power plants pay for the right to spew CO2 actually lower CO2 emissions? Critics argue no; supporters say yes. There is evidence for both, but in the long run, the benefits of RGGI for both Virginia and the climate are clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RGGI operates as a carbon cap-and-trade agreement between 12 northeastern states. Carbon-emitting power plants must buy allowances through an auction process. This makes high-carbon fossil fuel electricity more expensive relative to zero-carbon sources like wind, solar and nuclear. The result, in theory, is that utilities are incentivized to buy less of the former and more of the latter. In states like Virginia, where utilities own generating plants, RGGI provides an incentive for them to abandon coal plants and build more zero-carbon sources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RGGI administrators say it has succeeded in lowering carbon emissions in member states by </span><a href="https://www.rggi.org/sites/default/files/Uploads/Fact%20Sheets/RGGI_101_Factsheet.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 50%,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> twice as fast as the nation as a whole. RGGI states typically spend at least some of the money raised in the carbon allowance auctions on energy efficiency improvements that allow people to use less electricity, further reducing emissions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But RGGI doesn’t operate in isolation. Several RGGI states are members of the PJM regional grid, comprising 13 states, including some that don’t participate in RGGI. Critics point out that, instead of building or buying renewable energy, a utility in a RGGI state can buy electricity produced in a state that doesn’t participate in RGGI. Fossil fuel plants in a non-RGGI state like West Virginia don’t have to pay to pollute, giving them a competitive edge over similar Virginia plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is known as “leakage,” a loophole that lets fossil fuel energy “leak” into RGGI states. If there were enough leakage, lower carbon emissions in RGGI could be offset by the higher emissions elsewhere in PJM, leaving overall emissions unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Haner, a respected advocate for low energy rates at the conservative Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy, </span><a href="https://www.thomasjeffersoninst.org/under-rggi-virginia-releases-more-co2-not-less/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">says</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this is what’s happening in Virginia. He cites data to show a big jump in electricity imports from 2020 to 2022. According to this calculation, CO2 emissions actually increased under RGGI, when they were supposed to be decreasing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are problems with this analysis, starting with the fact that Virginia entered RGGI in 2020, at the onset of the pandemic. That year saw energy demand — and emissions — plummet. It would be strange indeed if Virginia emissions did not rise when the economy rebounded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy demand is also increasing in Virginia due to the boom in data center construction. Data centers are huge energy hogs, and they are being built faster than our utilities can build new electricity generation to serve them. The new generation will be zero-emission solar and, soon, offshore wind; meanwhile the electricity has to be imported from elsewhere in PJM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill Shobe, an economist with the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia who has done extensive work in support of Virginia’s energy transition, told me in an email there are other reasons to be skeptical of the conclusion that RGGI caused Virginia’s carbon emissions to increase. I’ll spare you the weedy details, but among other things, Virginia’s nuclear production decreased significantly from 2020 to 2021, which has nothing to do with RGGI. And as Shobe notes, the data centers would get built somewhere, if not here, so perhaps they should not be counted against us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am not as forgiving of data centers as Shobe is. Tech companies have chosen Virginia for its fiber optic network and generous tax incentives, and they point to Virginia’s climate laws as progress in meeting their own sustainability commitments. Data centers are taking our money and busting our carbon cap; they owe it to us to procure their own renewable energy, if not in Virginia, then within PJM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers notwithstanding, Shobe’s own calculations show leakage to be much less than Haner’s data suggests. “It is abundantly clear that emission leakage is relatively modest,” he told me. “In the end, the other advantages of RGGI (lowering compliance costs, revenue for efficiency and flood resilience, etc.) will swamp the small leakage margin.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For RGGI critics like Haner and Gov. Glenn Youngkin, of course, effects on CO2 emissions are really beside the point anyway. They would gladly accept higher emissions if it meant lower rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is analogous to what happens when American manufacturers move operations to countries with cheaper labor and lax environmental laws. One way to stem the tide would be to lower our own environmental standards and suppress wages in the U.S., removing the incentive to offshore operations by making life equally miserable everywhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The better alternative is to raise the bar everywhere so that everyone benefits. That’s not just the right thing to do; it actually works. In the international arena, American leadership on clean energy investment is already forcing other countries to discuss </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-09/us-energy-regains-its-swagger-while-rest-of-world-gets-ira-envy#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upping their game</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Here in the U.S., RGGI has attracted new member states — like Virginia — and prompted discussions within PJM about creating </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/committees-groups/task-forces/rastf/2022/20220204/20220204-item-03a-clean-procurement-perspectives-rmi.ashx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a region-wide clean energy market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Virginia alone doesn’t have the market power to force other states to change. Fortunately for us and for the climate, leakage will become less of an issue over time as renewable energy outcompetes fossil fuel power everywhere. PJM’s carbon emissions have </span><a href="https://epsa.org/pjms-annual-emissions-report-shows-continued-emissions-declines-across-the-region/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">trended steadily lower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, first as methane displaced coal, and more recently as renewable energy displaces all fossil fuels. That displacement will accelerate with federal clean energy incentives in place and innovation continuing to drive renewable energy costs lower. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Virginia crafted its energy transition framework with an eye for ensuring our economy gains, no matter what other states do. As Shobe noted, lowering carbon emissions is just one benefit of RGGI membership; carbon auctions fund energy efficiency and flood control projects here, and the switch away from high-emission coal plants means our residents breathe cleaner air. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our RGGI law is also part of a larger package designed to create jobs and economic development here at home. The Virginia Clean Economy Act provides for utilities to procure electricity from solar and wind generating facilities and battery storage located in Virginia, which will reduce leakage over time. It also requires an increasing percentage of Dominion and Appalachian Power’s electricity to come from renewable energy. After 2025, most of that must come from in-state facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/19/your-electric-bills-are-skyrocketing-blame-our-failure-to-invest-in-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve shown before</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, building low-cost wind and solar helps to lower rates and provides price stability when fossil fuel costs spike. Virginia’s energy transition is just getting underway, but it will deliver benefits for years to come. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A seemingly simple question came across my desk a few weeks ago: What does Dominion Energy Virginia charge residents per kilowatt-hour (kWh)? Given how frequently I write about Dominion, I was embarrassed not to have a quick answer. In my own defense, though, Dominion makes it hard to find out. And when you do find out, the answer is, it depends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Examine a recent bill, and you will see the number of kilowatt-hours you used in the preceding month, a confusing list of charges and the dollar amount that you owe. You can do the math to figure out what you paid this month per kilowatt-hour, but that’s more of a snapshot than the whole picture.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_34679" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:247px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imageedit_6_5570730308.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-34679" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imageedit_6_5570730308-247x300.jpg" alt="" width="247" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imageedit_6_5570730308-247x300.jpg 247w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imageedit_6_5570730308-843x1024.jpg 843w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imageedit_6_5570730308-768x932.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/imageedit_6_5570730308.jpg 1135w" sizes="(max-width: 247px) 100vw, 247px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A Fairfax resident&#8217;s Mar. 6, 2023 Dominion Energy electricity bill. (Ivy Main/The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked colleagues to send me their utility bills to see what people were actually paying, and I got out my calculator. Everyone’s rate was different, and the more electricity they used, the less they paid per kWh. Even after I removed state and local taxes from the equation, rates ranged from a low of 12.2 cents per kWh for a home that used 2930 kWh in February, to a high of 17.3 cents for a home that, thanks to solar panels, drew just 179 kWh from the grid in the same time period. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As that solar home shows, the flat rate of the basic customer charge skews the average price higher. That basic charge is currently $6.58 per month, according to Dominion’s </span><a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/-/media/pdfs/virginia/residential-rates/schedule-1.pdf?la=en&amp;rev=77a761f57c8241038dfa13e990c3caf0&amp;hash=BF54C2E8EC883D3A6C6323326A3E3F25" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">residential rate schedule</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but you won’t see it on your bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rate schedule reveals other information your bill doesn’t tell you, and that’s where the real impact lies: you pay less per kWh, in both generation and distribution charges, for the electricity you use in excess of 800 kilowatts per month from October through May. From June to September, you pay </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">less</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in distribution charges for every kilowatt over 800, but </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in generation charges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re also charged a single rate year-round for transmission, which is different from distribution. Plus, every kilowatt-hour is subject to a list of riders – “charges applied to certain rate schedules to recover various costs associated with Dominion Energy&#8217;s electric operations and electricity production,” according to Dominion – and non-bypassable charges. The rate schedule doesn’t identify these charges, but the bill does, albeit with no explanation for how the amounts are determined. Your bill also lists fuel as a separate charge under Electricity Supply, though fuel does not appear in the rate schedule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still with me? No? All of this must make sense to the State Corporation Commission, which approved the rate schedule, but it is thoroughly opaque to customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sufficiently dogged can find a worksheet on Dominion’s </span><a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/virginia/billing/understand-my-bill" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that breaks out all these costs. If you plug in the month and a number of kWh you used, it will calculate a bill. You still need to do the math yourself to arrive at the price per kWh, but you can then play with numbers to see how usage affects rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing that confirms what I saw in my colleagues’ bills. Assuming 1,000 kWh, the number Dominion uses to represent the “typical” customer, the price works out to 14 cents in winter.  Change that to a frugal 500 kWh and you get 15 cents. Raise it to 2,000 kWh, and it goes down to about 13 cents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When challenged about this in the past, Dominion justified its buy-more, pay-less winter rate structure by </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/38jb01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it was needed to make bills affordable for customers with electric heating, whose use can double or triple in the wintertime. The company didn’t mention that it also benefits wealthier people with large homes, and decreases the incentive for customers to conserve energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also turns out that large homes do well in summer, too. According to the worksheet, a customer using 1,000 kWh in June would pay 14.6 cents per kWh. For 2,000 kWh, it rises slightly to 14.7 cents. The customer who uses only 500 kWh pays the highest rate, at 15 cents. Energy efficiency, alas, is not rewarded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Dominion’s bills aren’t just confusing, they mask a perverse incentive in the rate structure that rewards people who use more electricity. This year’s utility legislation </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/03/15/what-this-years-electric-utility-legislation-does/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=177b5ad8-4512-449b-8290-75bae7eefc51" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changes a lot of things</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it doesn’t require greater clarity in billing,  nor does it fix that upside-down incentive.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_1095" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dominion-sign-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-1095" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dominion-sign-1-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dominion-sign-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dominion-sign-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dominion-sign-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dominion-sign-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dominion-sign-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dominion-sign-1-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dominion-sign-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A sign outside of a Dominion Energy office building in downtown Richmond.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This perverse incentive is shared by some other Virginia utilities, though not all, and not all hide the ball the way Dominion does. </span><a href="https://www.appalachianpower.com/company/about/rates/va" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows it charges a single rate no matter how much you use. There’s neither a price break nor a penalty for higher consumption. The website provides two examples, for customers using 1,000 and 2,000 kWh, respectively. This makes it easy to calculate what you’re paying per kWh (about 16.5 cents), though you won’t find that number on either the website or the bills themselves. But neither the bill nor APCo’s website mentions the existence or amount of the basic customer charge, which can only be inferred from the website examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also looked at February bills sent me by customers of Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative (NOVEC) and Rappahannock Electric Cooperative (REC). In both cases the bills were easy to understand. They identify the flat monthly charge, though in both cases the charge is unfortunately more than twice as high as Dominion’s. The bills also list the rates applicable per kWh for generation, transmission and distribution. Both utilities give a year-round volume discount on the distribution charge for higher levels of usage, another regrettable feature. However, REC’s </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7p_z01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SCC filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows it imposes a higher electricity supply charge in summer for monthly usage over 800 kWh. I could not find current information about NOVEC’s rates online; I hope its customers have better access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being able to understand your electric bill matters. Virginia’s average residential rates increased 20% between December 2021 and December 2022, according to the </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Energy Information Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, mostly due to last year’s spike in the price of methane gas and coal. Even before last year, </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">our bills were higher</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than those in most other states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers have an array of options to help them lower their energy costs, including new federal and state programs and incentives for weatherization, energy efficient appliances and renewable energy. But customers who are confused about what they currently pay are less likely to act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the same reason, utility rate structures should incentivize customers to take steps that conserve energy. Lower rates for using more electricity undercut the value of investments in energy efficiency. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If utilities want to help their customers, they can start by sending the right message. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For followers of Virginia energy policy, 2023 will be remembered as the year Dominion Energy lost its stranglehold on the General Assembly. The utility’s all-out campaign to boost its return on equity earned it little more than crumbs. By contrast, a bill to return authority over rates to the State Corporation Commission garnered overwhelming support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another surprise loser was the nuclear industry. Gov. Youngkin and boosters of small modular reactors (SMRs) expected a lot more love, and incentives, than legislators proved willing to dole out this early in the technology’s development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less noticed was the rise to political power of one of Dominion’s largest customers, Amazon Web Services. Many legislators may still not have caught on, but the corps of lobbyists who haunt the hallways of the General Assembly building know a 500-pound gorilla when they see one. As one lobbyist put it: “Amazon is the new Dominion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the standout takeaways from a legislative session in which, otherwise, few significant energy bills emerged from the scrum. Senate Democrats ably protected the energy transition framework established in 2020 and 2021, but modest efforts to accelerate the transition mostly failed. Of the roughly </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2023/01/19/attacks-on-virginias-climate-laws-are-front-and-center-at-the-general-assembly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60 bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I followed this session, only a handful made it to the governor’s desk. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republican attacks on the energy transition failed</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three foundational bills of Virginia’s energy transition — the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) and Clean Cars — all came under attack this year, as they did last year. And again, repeal efforts failed every time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Democrats blocked </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1001" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the one bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have pulled Virginia out of RGGI. Gov. Youngkin remains bent on achieving the pullout by regulation through  Department of Environmental Quality rulemaking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the transportation sector, every bill to repeal the Air Pollution Control Board’s authority to implement the Advanced Clean Car Standard failed in the Senate as Democrats held the line in Commerce and Labor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to undermine key parts of the VCEA failed, including </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2130" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://v" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bills that would have given the State Corporation Commission more authority over closures of fossil fuel plants and require it to conduct annual reviews designed to second-guess the VCEA’s framework for lowering emissions and building renewable energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A House </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1430" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have exempted certain industrial customers categorized as “energy-intensive trade-exposed industries” from paying their share of the VCEA’s costs passed the House on a party-line basis. However, with the bill facing certain death in Senate Commerce and Labor, patron Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, requested it be stricken. At the time, he had reason to expect that a compromise approach proposed by Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William, would pass. McPike’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1454" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would have had the SCC put together a group of experts to study the issue and make recommendations. After passing the Senate, however, McPike’s study bill went to House Energy and Commerce, which insisted on amending it to mirror Del. Ware’s bill. That did not go over well in the Senate, where the House substitute was  unanimously rejected. McPike then asked the Senate to kill his own bill, and the energy-intensive trade-exposed industries got nothing. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Raids on the VCEA produced mixed results</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the VCEA’s strengths is in creating incentives for clean energy. That’s also a vulnerability, because everybody and their brother wants in on the incentives — and this year, once again, the brothers came peddling some pretty sketchy stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, however, the VCEA sustained little damage. An effort to open up the renewable energy category to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1643" target="_blank"><b>coal mine methane</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was modified to become simply a policy to encourage the beneficial capture and use of methane that would otherwise escape from old coal mines into the air. However, methane extraction jobs in four Southwest Virginia counties will </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2178" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">now qualify</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a “green jobs” tax credit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More successful was an effort by the forestry industry to allow more woody biomass</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">to qualify for the renewable portfolio standard (RPS); this was in spite of </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/02/whats-not-to-like-about-biomass-deforestation-pollution-and-overpriced-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">drawbacks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> including high levels of pollution, expense and large climate impact. As passed, the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2026" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1231" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bills will allow Dominion-owned biomass plants to remain open and have their output qualify for the RPS, so long as they burn only waste wood from forestry operations. Climate advocates opposed the change, but remain hopeful that Dominion and the SCC will want to close these uneconomic biomass plants to protect ratepayers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two different </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2311" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a> <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2197" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that tried to shoehorn nuclear and hydrogen into the RPS failed in the Senate. A third </span><a href="http://v" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promoting small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) got more traction initially; it would have had the SCC develop a pilot program for SMRs with a goal of having the first one operational by 2032. After it passed the House, the Senate Commerce and Labor committee adopted amendments to require the SCC to examine the cost of any SMRss  relative to alternatives, and to prevent ratepayers from being charged for the costs if an SMR never became operational. The Senate voted unanimously for the bill with these protections included, but the House rejected them. Ultimately, the bill died, a remarkable setback for the governor’s nuclear ambitions.</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Utility reform consumed most of the session (again)</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s money grabs have turned into near-annual food fights. This one almost wrecked the cafeteria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The action proceeded along two fronts. One consisted of bipartisan, pro-consumer </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1604" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1321" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislation promoted as the Affordable Energy Act, intended to return ratemaking authority to the SCC. As passed, it merely authorizes the SCC to modify Dominion’s or Appalachian Power’s base rates going forward, if it determines that current rates will produce revenues outside the utility’s authorized rate of return. If that strikes you as hard to argue with, you’re not alone; no one in either chamber voted against it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far more divisive was Dominion’s own effort to secure an increased rate of return on equity (ROE). This legislation earned its own bipartisan support from Dominion loyalists, led by Senate Majority Leader Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax, for the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1265" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and House Majority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, for the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1770" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As initially drafted, it probably should have been called the Unaffordable Energy Act instead of the reassuringly bureaucratic-sounding Virginia Electric Utility Regulation Act. The bill described a formula for determining Dominion’s allowed ROE that </span><a href="https://www.baconsrebellion.com/app/uploads/2023/02/Letter-to-Dels.-Ware-and-Sullivan-2.10.23.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SCC staff calculated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could result in an ROE as high as 11.57%, up from the currently-allowed 9.35%. SCC staff told legislators this could cost ratepayers $4 billion through 2040. In return, the bill offered some near-term savings for customers but also would have removed the last vestige of retail competition and opened VCEA coal plant retirement commitments to second-guessing by the SCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion pulled out all the stops. The company supplemented its own in-house lobbying corps of 13 with </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/lobbying/client/120206-dominion-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another 17</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> top lobbyists from around Richmond. Former senator John Watkins signed on, as did former FERC commissioner Bernard McNamee. CEO Bob Blue showed up personally  to push the bill. Dominion ran full-page ads in the Washington Post and Virginia newspapers touting a provision of the bill that would save ratepayers $300 million (neglecting to mention that it was the ratepayers’ own money). The ad featured a dog so people could be sure Dominion was being friendly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It didn’t work. The consumer advocates hung tough, and Gov. Youngkin, possibly a cat person, added his weight to the resistance. As the Mercury </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/25/general-assembly-deal-sets-dominion-profits-for-two-years-while-overhauling-regulatory-system/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=c4715420-f2e2-42ac-87ab-52f0fc60710d" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the “compromise” that all parties now swear they are delighted with gives Dominion very little kibble. The coal plants will be retired on schedule, ratepayers will see savings and a larger percentage of over earnings will be returned to customers in the future. In exchange, Dominion’s future return on equity will be bumped up to 9.7%, but only for two years, after which the SCC will have discretion to set the ROE as it deems fair. (That is, if Dominion doesn’t start the next food fight first.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian Power had its own troubles this session. APCo-only </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1777" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have replaced the requirement for an integrated resource plan with an “annual true-up review” was radically amended to become an entirely different bill. It now allows both utilities to finance the high fuel costs they’ve incurred due to soaring natural gas and coal prices. The amendments were welcomed both as a way to handle the fuel debt and so that no one had to figure out what a true-up review is. The bills passed handily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One other successful piece of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1166" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may help avoid future food fights. Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, and Del. Kilgore worked together to resuscitate the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR) and create more transparency around utility planning. The original bill also created a structure for state energy planning, but that proved too much for House Republicans, who amended it down to the lean bill that passed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years CEUR earned a bad reputation as an entity that rarely met but that served as an excuse for legislators to defer action on pro-consumer bills. That makes advocates somewhat wary of this bill. On the other hand, provisions welcoming stakeholders into the utility integrated resource planning process seems likely to benefit the public, if not the utilities.  </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Elsewhere, consumers did poorly</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion may have taken a drubbing on its money grab, but it did pretty well in guarding its monopoly. The Dominion-friendly Senate Commerce and Labor committee killed a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1419" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow customers to buy renewable energy at a competitive rate from a provider other than their own utility. Bills to expand shared solar passed the Senate but died in the House. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the House turned into a killing field for any bill with the word “solar” in it, no matter how innocuous or popular. A House Rules subcommittee killed a bill that would have </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB848" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">helped schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> take advantage of onsite solar, though it had passed the Senate unanimously. A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HJ545" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to study barriers to local government investments in clean energy was left in House Rules. A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1333" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to create a solar and economic development fund passed the Senate but was tabled in House Appropriations. A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hj487&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directing the Department of Transportation to study the idea of putting solar panels in highway medians never got a hearing in House Rules. A consumer-protection effort for buyers of rooftop solar was </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2355&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tabled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in House Commerce and Energy. A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB984" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clarifying the legality of solar leases passed the Senate unanimously, only to be left in House Commerce and Energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do we detect a little frustration on the part of House Republicans at the complete failure of their anti-clean energy agenda? Why, yes. Yes, we do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only pro-consumer legislation to pass was a very modest </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1323" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requiring the SCC to establish annual energy efficiency savings targets for Dominion customers who are low-income, elderly, disabled or veterans of military service. But </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB949" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have made homeowners eligible for low-cost loans through property-assessed clean energy (PACE) programs failed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion beat back </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an effort</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to make it hold ratepayers harmless if its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project fails to produce as much energy as expected. A </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1477" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow the company to create an affiliate to secure financing for the project passed. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1441" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to move up the VCEA’s deadline for offshore wind farm construction from 2034 to 2032 passed; the law now also requires that the SCC consider economic and job creation benefits to Virginia in overseeing cost recovery. However, a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1854" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have required the SCC to issue annual reports on the progress of CVOW failed. That bill would also have required the SCC to analyze alternative ownership structures that might save ratepayers money. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The gas ban ban fails again</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1783" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to bar local governments from prohibiting new gas connections passed the House on a party-line vote but was killed in Senate Commerce and Labor. A Senate </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1485&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">companion bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Democrat Joe Morrissey, which had caused something of a tizzy initially, was stricken at Morrissey’s request. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">And this year’s big winner is &#8230; Amazon!</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With data centers now making up over 21% of Dominion’s load and since they have already sucked up over a billion dollars in tax subsidies, this should have been the year Virginia government woke up to the need for state oversight of the industry. Alas, no. Bills that would limit where data centers could be sited failed. Senate </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+SJ240" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that would have simply tasked the Department of Energy with studying the impact of data centers passed the Senate on a voice vote but was killed in a subcommittee of House Rules on a 3-2 vote, the same fate suffered by a similar </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HJ522" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who could be against studying the impact of an industry this big? Aside from the data center industry that is enjoying the handouts, the answer is the Youngkin administration. The governor is so pleased with Amazon’s plan to spend $35 billion on more data centers across Virginia that he promised the company even greater handouts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those handouts take the form of a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2479" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> creating the Cloud Computing Cluster Infrastructure Grant Fund, with parameters that ensure only Amazon gets $165 million. In addition, the far more impactful sales and use tax exemption, currently set to expire in 2035, will be continued out to 2040 with an option to go to 2050; again, this is all just for Amazon, unless some other company manages to pony up $35 billion in data center investments. In return, Amazon must create a total of just  1,000 new jobs across the entire commonwealth, and only 100 of them must pay “at least one and a half times the prevailing wage.” A jobs bill, this is not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the sales and use tax exemption already costing Virginia $130 million per year and growing rapidly, this legislation will be very costly. You would not know it, though, from the budget analysis performed for legislators. Through the magic of accounting rules, that analysis managed to conclude that the budget impact of this legislation would be zero. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As preposterous as that is, it may explain why only a few legislators voted against the bill. They have no idea what the governor is getting us into.</span></p>

(Hugh Kenny)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, with Northern Virginia’s data center boom well underway, I worked with the Sierra Club to provide comments to the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) on a proposed major source air permit for a data center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We urged that the data center, owned by Digital Realty, be required to minimize its reliance on highly-polluting, back-up diesel generators by installing on-site solar and battery storage. While rooftop solar alone wouldn’t produce more than a fraction of the energy a data center uses, solar panels and batteries could provide a strong first line of defense against grid outages, without the air pollution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t a new idea; other data centers elsewhere were </span><a href="https://aiso.net/our-technology" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using clean energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and storage or </span><a href="https://www.eaton.com/content/dam/eaton/markets/data-center/Eaton-provides-Webaxys-new-eco-designed-data-center-with-a-complete-energy-storage-and-management-system.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">installing microgrids</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> capable of providing all of the power the facility needed. Yet DEQ rejected the suggestion and gave the go-ahead for the data center to install 139 diesel generators with no pollution controls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three years later, data centers have proliferated to such a degree that the power grid can’t keep up. DEQ is now </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/16830/638102334970400000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that more than 100 data centers in Loudoun, Prince William and Fairfax counties </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/31/VA-REGULATORS-PROPOSE-EASING-EMISSION-LIMITS-FOR-DATA-CENTERS-OVER-POWER-TRANSMISSION-CONCERNS/?UTM_MEDIUM=EMAIL" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">be given a variance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from air pollution controls so they can run their diesel generators any time the transmission system is strained. DEQ is </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/permits-regulations/public-notices/air" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taking comment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">s on the proposal through March 14 and will hold a hearing at its office in Woodbridge on February 27.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a resident of Fairfax County, I’ll be one of the people forced to breathe diesel pollution to keep data centers running. Make no mistake: There would be no grid emergency without these data centers’ thousands of megawatts worth of electricity demand. And there wouldn’t be a threat to Northern Virginia’s air quality without their diesel generators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s fair to ask: Should these data centers have been built if the infrastructure to deliver power to them wasn’t ready? I’d also like to know why DEQ thinks it’s okay to impose on residents the combined pollution from many thousands of diesel generators firing at once, when it has known since at least 2019 that viable, clean alternatives exist. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Batteries alone are an obvious solution for short-term emergency use, and can provide exactly the kind of help to the grid that will be needed this year. Instead of calling on data centers to run diesel generators, a grid operator can avoid the strain by tapping into a data center’s battery, a solution </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/clean-energy-projects-begin-to-power-google-data-centers" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is implementing.      </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But data centers can economically lower their energy and water costs as well as reduce strain on the electric grid by reducing their energy use and using on-site renewable energy. Global energy management companies like Schneider Electric, Virginia AECOM and Arlington’s  </span><a href="http://www.thestellagroupltd.com/scott-sklar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Stella Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> design </span><a href="https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1592575&amp;tp_key=3c62fdea05" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">microgrid solutions for data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other facilities that need 24/7 power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I contacted Stella Group president Scott Sklar to ask how feasible it is for Northern Virginia’s data centers to meet their needs without diesel generators, given land constraints that limit their ability to meet demand with on-site solar. He told me data centers can start by reducing their cooling load by two-thirds by using efficiency and waste heat; cooling, he says, accounts for 38% to 47% of electricity demand. Cost-effective energy efficiency can reduce energy demand by one-third, and waste-heat-to-electricity can meet another 25% to 38% of the remaining electric load. “If you cut the cooling load and use waste heat to electricity, then you only need renewable energy and batteries for a maximum of half,” he concluded. “That’s doable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Virginia data centers don’t start taking these kinds of measures, the situation will get worse. This year’s grid strain may be relieved through construction of new generation and transmission infrastructure, but the industry’s staggering growth rate threatens to create future problems. In 2019, when the Sierra Club was urging DEQ to think about the environmental impact of data centers, the industry consumed 12% of Dominion Virginia Energy’s total electric supply. Today, </span><a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/510812146/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/2022-11-04-DE-IR-3Q-2022-earnings-call-slides-vTC.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that number has risen to 21%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a figure that does not include the many data centers served by electric cooperatives rather than Dominion.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just last month, Gov. Youngkin </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/02/are-virginia-ratepayers-and-residents-subsidizing-the-data-center-industry/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Amazon Web Services will invest $35 billion in  new data centers in Virginia, at least </span><a href="https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/cloud/article/11427911/aws-has-spent-35-billion-on-its-northern-virginia-data-centers" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doubling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amazon’s existing investments here. By way of thanks, Youngkin wants taxpayers to provide up to $140 million in grant funding to Amazon and extend Virginia’s </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/09/virginia-has-a-data-center-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already-generous</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tax subsidy program. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/02/02/are-virginia-ratepayers-and-residents-subsidizing-the-data-center-industry/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ratepayers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would also subsidize the build-out by contributing to the cost of new generation and transmission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon </span><a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/1/amazon-sets-a-new-record-for-most-renewable-energy-purchased-by-a-single-company" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claims to lead</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the list of tech companies buying renewable energy, though its investments are mostly in other states and abroad. A scathing </span><a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/click-clean-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2019 showed Amazon owned the majority of the data centers in Virginia at that time, but had made few investments in renewable energy here. Since then, Amazon has developed new solar facilities statewide, including enough to power its new Arlington headquarters. But as I discussed in </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/09/virginia-has-a-data-center-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a previous column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, all the solar in Virginia would not be enough to make a dent in the energy appetite of Northern Virginia’s data centers, of which Amazon owns </span><a href="https://dgtlinfra.com/amazon-aws-microsoft-data-centers-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 100</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no special beef with Amazon, but I do think that a rich tech company with pretensions to sustainability leadership should do more to walk the walk in the state that hosts so much of its operations. Surely that includes not relying solely on diesel generators for back-up power at its data centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also have no beef with data centers in general. They provide necessary services in today’s world, and they have to go somewhere. Data centers could be a valuable source of revenue and economic development for Southwest Virginia and other parts of the state that are not grid-constrained. They could do this only if there are guardrails in place to protect </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/02/10/data-centers-northern-virginia-internet/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearby communities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the environment, and if they help rather than hurt our clean energy transition. Right now, none of this is the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, Gov. Youngkin not only doesn’t want guardrails, he doesn’t even want to know where and why they are needed. On February 3, a representative of his administration spoke in committee in opposition to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SJ240" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax that would have the Department of Energy and DEQ study the impact of data centers on Virginia’s environment, energy supply and climate goals. The Senate agreed to the study, but a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HJ522" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> died in the House, and a House subcommittee killed Petersen’s Senate version Monday on a 2-1 vote. (The vote was later changed to 3-2 when two delegates who missed the meeting, and the discussion, added their votes. Killing a bill in a tiny subcommittee is one way House procedures allow delegates to avoid accountability on controversial issues, but that’s a topic for another day.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke with Sen. Petersen by phone after the subcommittee hearing. He pointed out that the administration would have been able to shape the study any way the governor wanted, and would have had control over the recommendations as well. Petersen’s conclusion: “He just doesn’t want anyone looking at it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refusing to look at a problem, however, never makes it go away. And in this case, the problem is just getting bigger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too late: cue the outrage from the right. &#8220;If the maniacs in the White House come for my stove, they can pry it from my cold dead hands,&#8221; </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RonnyJacksonTX/status/1612839703018934274" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas. A number of people tweeted back that they were eager to see this happen, but then it turned out no one in the White House actually wants to ban gas stoves, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What kind of stove you use might seem an odd contender for a culture war issue, but the outrage beast needs constant feeding. The ranting leaves no time for anyone to point out that electricity powers the </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/4-things-to-know-about-the-gas-stove-frenzy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">great majority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of U.S. stoves, methane gas isn’t even an option in much of the country, and — eh — we Americans don’t really cook that much, anyway. If we were arguing over microwave ovens, more of us would have a dog in this fight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the mere fact that you never gave your stove much thought before does not excuse you from taking sides now. If you are a Democrat, you must drool over induction stoves, even if you aren’t sure what they are or how they work. If you are a Republican, you must support burning fossil fuels in the kitchen and weep for the plight of Michelin-starred chefs whose restaurants you can’t afford to go to (and indeed, many of whom have been </span><a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-1-spring/notes-here-there/chefs-turn-gas-and-light-induction-cooktops" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won over by induction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the ingrates). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the difficulties the gas industry faces in politicizing stoves is that it wins over the wrong people. An Energy Information Agency </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=53439" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">map</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows the percentage of households that cook with gas is highest in a bunch of blue states like California and New York, and lowest in the deep-red South and the Dakotas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reasons are pragmatic, not political. Gas utilities in rural states like </span><a href="https://insideenergy.org/2017/04/06/filling-in-the-natural-gas-gaps/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are much less likely to have invested in the expensive network of distribution pipelines needed to bring service to far-flung communities. The rural geography problem affects much of the South as well, but weather is a factor, too. Since furnaces, not cookstoves, are the big fuel users, the relatively warm winters of the South make it a less lucrative market than the colder North. Thus, </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=30672" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">electricity dominates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> heating as well cooking in southern states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If gas companies have chosen not to serve areas where they would make less money, who can blame them? On the other hand, with gas furnaces increasingly unable to compete with </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-systems" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more efficient</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> heat pumps, they now risk losing their northern customers to electric alternatives. Either they sit and stare into the abyss of an all-electric future in which they are obsolete, or they have to do what they can to slow their inevitable decline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so they set out to convince state legislatures to prevent local governments from barring new gas hookups in their communities, as many left-leaning cities have been doing in the interests of climate and health. Gas stove diehards are the industry’s unwitting (and sometimes </span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2020/06/gas-industry-influencers-stoves/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">witting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) poster children.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the face of it, the gas industry has been successful: </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/natural-gas-ban-preemptive-laws-gop-climate/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least 20 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> controlled by Republican legislatures have enacted gas ban preemption laws. Sadly for the gas utilities, the wins have occurred in those southern and rural states where they don’t have as much business to protect anyway. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what makes Virginia an important next target. </span><a href="https://energyinfrastructure.org/~/media/energyinfrastructure/images/pipeline/natural-gas-use-in-va-final-version.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost one-third</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Virginia households are customers of natural gas utilities, and only a </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/getattachment/8ace25f1-cfc1-41f9-a3da-2b5b8dae7ef1/gas_map.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">handful</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of rural Virginia counties have no gas service at all. There is certainly room for growth. Yet a number of urban and suburban localities have adopted climate goals that call on their governments to lower greenhouse gas emissions. The gas industry fears these localities may decide banning new gas hookups could be one step towards the goal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The risk seems slight. Virginia is a Dillon Rule state, meaning local governments have only the authority delegated to them by the General Assembly. Given the difficulty Virginia localities have had even getting authority to ban single-use plastic bags (they still can </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/09/24/led-by-roanoke-virginia-cities-and-counties-begin-taxing-plastic-bags/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only tax them</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not pry them from your cold, dead hands), it seems unlikely they would seek, or get, authority to ban new gas hookups any time soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, when the General Assembly first </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/02/proposal-to-forbid-local-gas-bans-dropped-in-senate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">considered legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to preempt gas bans last year, the focus was on the City of Richmond and the incompatibility of the city’s 2050 carbon-neutrality pledge with its continued operation of its own gas utility. The city itself didn’t seem to be thinking that far ahead, and climate activists have since </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/03/more-richmond-gas-investments-will-require-taxpayer-bailout/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Richmond is more intent on upgrading its gas infrastructure than in phasing it out. Still, the gas industry had a target to point to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House was willing to adopt the full gas preemption ban, but a Senate committee reworked the legislation to focus on the problem at hand. The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+HB1257H1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law that passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> imposed a requirement that any municipality with a gas utility notify its customers and put the utility up for sale before exiting the business. All parties pronounced themselves satisfied, declared victory and went home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year the gas industry has no threat to point to but is nonetheless again trying to get the preemption bill passed. The bill language includes a kind of culture war code term, a declaration that “energy justice” means you have the right to buy gas if you can afford it and the gas company has the right not to supply you if you can’t, or if serving you isn’t profitable for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The better description for this, surely, is the free market, which is quite distinct from justice. So, is it justice or merely irony that even if it were to pass, many Republicans who voted for the bill still wouldn’t get gas service for their constituents because serving rural areas is not in the interests of the industry? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it did last year, the Republican-led House has passed the industry’s bill along party lines. In the Democratic-controlled Senate, though, matters get interesting. This year the gas industry secured a Senate patron, Democrat Joe Morrissey. Though Morrissey is hardly popular in the party, he is still at least one Democratic vote for the bill in a closely divided chamber. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems obvious enough that the preemption ban is on the wrong side of history, at a time when our burning of fossil fuels is already causing climate chaos. It’s also not going to stave off the inevitable for long. Building electrification will continue. Over time, more consumers will choose heat pumps and induction stoves over methane gas, not for political reasons but for health reasons and because the technology is better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if we agree the gas industry will lose out in the end, is it really a big deal if Virginia localities are barred from doing something they don’t seem to have authority to do anyway?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, actually, yes. Even if Virginia localities can’t make a blanket prohibition on new gas connections, it’s not hard to imagine that a locality might choose to reject a particular gas connection to a particular construction project or subdivision where the gas line would cross parkland or wetland, or be problematic for some other very specific, very local and very legitimate reason. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s balance of power has always recognized that land-use decisions should be made at the local level. This legislation hands a cudgel to the gas industry and developers to override a legitimate local land use decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For that, legislators should have a better reason than taking sides in a culture war.</span></p>

(Sun Tribe Solar)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar schools, climate resiliency, energy efficiency: Local governments are now involved in energy planning – whether they feel ready for it or not. Some localities have adopted climate goals that require them to look for ways to lower carbon emissions; others just want to save money on high energy bills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has chipped away at the barriers to renewable energy and started putting hundreds of millions of dollars into energy efficiency programs, thanks to laws like Solar Freedom, the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) and the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act, which made Virginia part of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But even a positive policy environment doesn’t flatten all barriers. At all levels of government — and for that matter, in homes and businesses — energy-saving projects get stalled by confusing information, lack of money or financing, layers of opaque bureaucracy or fear of uncertain outcomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attacks on Virginia’s clean energy transition framework and utility reform get most of the ink during this legislative session, but some less-noticed bills are focused on moving ahead by removing stumbling blocks to clean energy and identifying funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I made a brief mention of some of these in my </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/18/attacks-on-virginias-climate-laws-are-front-and-center-at-the-general-assembly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill round-up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week, including </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HJ545" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Joint Resolution 545</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Briana Sewell, D-Prince William, asking the Department of Energy to recommend ways to overcome barriers that keep local governments and their constituents from purchasing clean energy. There is also </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1333" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1333</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, to facilitate local clean energy projects for low- and moderate-income residents. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1419" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1419</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke, would allow retail choice in renewable energy purchasing, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB949" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 949</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax, would allow residents to access low-cost public financing of clean energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shared solar bills I covered last week also allow local governments to participate. And although I’m not tracking them myself, there are other bills that encourage local </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB847S1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resiliency planning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, give localities authority to require electric vehicle charging infrastructure or support transit solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overwhelmingly — but not exclusively! — the bills this year that try to move the ball forward on clean energy come from Democrats, a bad sign when the House and governor are Republican. I have seen many bills die in committee for reasons that have little to do with the bill, and Gov. Youngkin notoriously vetoed bills last year seemingly  as a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/youngkin-vetoes-bills-from-senator-who-challenged-governors-aide/article_aa38b745-dc39-5632-a23e-db11da3862a4.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“personal and political move”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against the bills’ patron senator.  It’s also a short session this year, so if a bill is complicated or has opposition from favored industries, it goes into committee with a strike against it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But many of these bills support private investments or save money for taxpayers, which are thankfully still bipartisan priorities. And some energy innovations are now mainstream across Virginia, in red counties as well as blue. Among these are solar schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let’s take a deeper look at one piece of legislation, the solar school roofs study at the center of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB848" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 848</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1852" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1852</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed"> I wish they all could be solar schools</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the summer of 2021, I was dismayed to learn that the school board for the city of Norfolk had been told none of their brand-new schools could be outfitted with solar panels because the roofs weren’t designed to take the extra weight. As a result, Norfolk could not do what dozens of school districts across Virginia have been doing: installing solar arrays to provide some or all of the energy the school consumed, saving money for taxpayers and giving students hands-on exposure to a fast-growing technology with terrific career potential.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What a missed opportunity, and yet, Norfolk wasn’t alone. I soon learned about a new school in Richmond where educators were eager for solar, but the steep pitch of the roof on the main part of the building wasn’t suitable. That left only a flat-roofed side wing that couldn’t hold enough panels to meet more than a fraction of the school’s needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From conversations with architects and solar developers, I know that building a school with a roof that can hold solar panels doesn’t have to be an added expense; mainly, you just have to plan for it. </span><a href="https://www.vmdo.com/wyck-knox.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wyck Knox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the architect who designed Arlington’s two net-zero energy schools (among others), says even building a school that can produce as much energy as it uses doesn’t have to cost more, if you simply approach the design process </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFpWWKzrEg8&amp;t=2080s" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">with that goal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designing a school with a solar-ready roof pays off when the school district enters a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a solar company that installs and owns the solar array. The school pays just for the electricity it produces, typically at a rate lower than what the utility charges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of this year, the financing options have expanded. The Inflation Reduction Act allows tax-exempt entities like local governments and schools to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/17/inflation-reduction-act-offers-big-incentives-for-tax-exempt-organizations-to-invest-in-renewable-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claim federal tax credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for renewable energy and batteries directly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why aren’t all schools solar schools? The answers might differ from one school district to the next, but generally it’s because nobody thought of it at the right time, or they don’t know how to go about it, or the right people aren’t on board. One stubborn facilities manager can stall a project indefinitely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Department of Energy says energy is the </span><a href="https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/sectors/k-12-school-districts" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second largest expense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for schools, after teacher salaries. Taxpayers should be able to expect their school districts will pursue strategies like onsite solar that reduce energy costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally, I support requiring school districts to, at the very least, analyze whether they could save money with solar roofs before they lock in designs that don’t include them. However, House Republicans killed an effort last year to impose such a requirement. And some school officials say it isn’t needed because they want to do solar; they just need help with the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB848" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 848</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1852" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1852</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> task the </span><a href="https://studies.virginiageneralassembly.gov/studies/540" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commission on School Construction and Modernization</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with developing recommendations to help schools incorporate renewable energy in the construction or renovation of schools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The commission itself </span><a href="https://www.vaco.org/county-connections/commission-on-school-construction-and-modernizations-makes-recommendations-to-the-general-assembly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> several pieces of legislation that are now before the General Assembly, including some around construction funding. That should make it easier to integrate solar recommendations into their other work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Favola said, “I am extraordinarily excited about the possibility of providing school systems with technical assistance on how to incorporate solar and other renewable energy components in their renovations and new buildings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and me both, Senator. You and me both. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year I do a round-up of climate and energy bills at the start of the General Assembly session. This year, as expected, Republicans continue their assault on the hallmark legislation passed in 2020 and 2021 committing Virginia to a zero-carbon economy by 2050. In addition, this year features the usual assortment of bills doing favors for special interests, efforts to help residents and local governments go solar and a brand-new money and power grab by Dominion Energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will update this round-up on </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">my blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if any interesting new bills show up. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Republicans are not down with the energy transition</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy may have </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2023/01/06/dominion-energys-climate-report-confirms-the-future-of-power-is-renewable/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">baked the transition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to renewables into its planning, but unsurprisingly, the Virginia Republican Party thinks the fight to preserve fossil fuel dependence is a winning issue. The three foundational bills of Virginia’s energy transition — the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) and Clean Cars — all come in for attack, either by outright repeal or death-by-a-thousand-cuts.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1001" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1001</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (introduced by Sen. Richard Stuart, R-Westmoreland) would repeal the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act, the statute that propelled Virginia into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Participation in RGGI is the vehicle by which utilities buy allowances to emit carbon pollution. Under RGGI, the number of allowances available declines every year, and Virginia’s power sector would reduce CO2 emissions 30% by 2030. The allowance auctions have already raised hundreds of millions of dollars that by law must be used for low-income energy efficiency programs and flood resilience projects. A similar bill failed last year, and Senate Democrats have pledged to block the effort again. Meanwhile, Gov. Glenn Youngkin is trying to withdraw Virginia from RGGI administratively, a move that former Attorney General Mark Herring ruled wasn’t legal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon allowance auctions are a foundational piece of the VCEA as well, but it is a much bigger law that touches on too many aspects of energy regulation for repeal of the whole thing. This isn’t stopping Republicans from trying to undermine key provisions. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2130" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2130</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (introduced by Del. Tony Wilt, R-Rockingham) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1125" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1125</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (introduced by Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell) would give the State Corporation Commission more authority over closures of fossil fuel plants and require it to conduct annual reviews aimed at second-guessing the VCEA’s framework for lowering emissions and building renewable energy. Achieving the VCEA’s climate goals is decidedly not the purpose; meanwhile, the legislation would remove business certainty and undercut utility planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other attacks on the VCEA take the form of favors for specific industries, but would effectively make the VCEA’s goal of reaching 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 at the least cost to consumers impossible. I’ve dealt separately with small modular reactors, hydrogen and coal mine methane below. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1430" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1430</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1480" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1480</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (put forth by Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan) exempt certain industrial customers categorized as “energy-intensive trade-exposed industries” from paying costs that the VCEA makes all customers pay. The exemption would last four years. The result would be nice for those industries but would shift costs onto everyone else. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB1454" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1454</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Sen. Jeremy McPike, D-Prince William) would have the SCC put together a group of experts to study the issue and make recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the transportation sector, no fewer than seven bills sought to repeal the Air Pollution Control Board’s authority to implement the Advanced Clean Car Standard: </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1372" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1372</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Del. Buddy Fowler, R-Hanover), </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1378" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1378</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Wilt), </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB778" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 778</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Stuart), </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB779" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 779</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Sen. Stephen Newman, R-Bedford), </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB781" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 781</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (from Sen. Bill DeSteph, R-Virginia Beach), </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB782" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 782</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Fredericksburg) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB785" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 785</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover). The Senate bills were killed in committee on Tuesday. Although so many identical bills looked like a failure of legislators to coordinate efforts, in fact the senators all signed on as co-patrons to each other’s bills, along with a dozen House Republicans. Republicans think they have a winning issue for the November election, and lots of them want to claim they filed “the” repeal of Clean Cars. The fate of the House Clean Car bills remains to be seen.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Raiding the store for polluter interests</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the VCEA is here to stay, there are some decidedly non-green industries that want to claim the green mantle to get in on the action. It’s not about making themselves feel better about their high greenhouse gas emissions. It’s about getting a piece of the market for renewable energy certificates and undermining the integrity of the renewable energy label. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+HB1643+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1643</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by House Majority Leader Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1121" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1121</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Hackworth) proclaim coal mine methane a renewable energy. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2178" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2178</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (patroned by Del. James Morefield, R-Tazewell) makes coal mine methane a qualifying industry for Virginia’s green job creation tax credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burning wood for electricity produces as much CO2 as coal, at a cost much higher than solar energy today. Yet </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2026" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2026</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced by Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Bristol</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1231" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1231</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Sen. Lynwood Lewis, D-Accomack) remove the requirement in the VCEA for the retirement of Dominion’s generating facilities that burn wood for electricity and allow these generating plants to qualify as renewable energy sources.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">SMRs and hydrogen</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of raiding the store, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2197" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2197</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (submitted by Del. Kathy Byron, R-Bedford) allows “advanced nuclear technology” to qualify for Virginia’s renewable portfolio standard (RPS). The bill defines the term as “a small modular reactor or other technology for generating nuclear energy,” which looks like an opening for existing nuclear plants as well. Even if it isn’t, treating any kind of nuclear technology as a renewable resource upsets the VCEA’s calibrated approach to nuclear as a zero-carbon technology alongside renewable energy, not in place of it. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2311" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2311</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kilgore) goes a step further, declaring both nuclear and hydrogen to be renewable energy sources and making them eligible for the RPS. Hydrogen, of course, is a fuel made from other sources of energy, which can be renewable but are more typically fossil fuels currently. Given Youngkin’s interest in seeing hydrogen made from coal mine methane, you can see where this is headed.  </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2333" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2333</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Del. Daniel Marshall, R-Danville) calls on the SCC to develop a pilot program to support building small modular nuclear reactors, with a goal of having the first one operational by 2032. In spite of the word “pilot,” the bill is ambitious. It contemplates four sites, each of which can have multiple reactors of up to 400  megawatts each.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Utility reform </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these bills are reform bills; some are “reform” bills. To recognize the difference, it helps to know whether the proponent is a public interest organization or the utility itself. When Dominion tells you it has a bill you’re going to love, you can be pretty sure the result will be bad for ratepayers. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1321" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1321</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (co-patroned by Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, and Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1604" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1604</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Ware), billed as the Affordable Energy Act, is real reform legislation that gives the SCC authority to lower a utility’s base rates if it determines that existing rates produce “unreasonable revenues in excess of the utility’s authorized rate of return.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other straightforward measures include </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2267" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2267</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Wilt) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1417" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1417</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke), which allow the SCC to decide to add the cost of a new utility generation project into base rates instead of granting a rate adjustment clause (RAC), and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1670" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1670</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Marshall), which returns rate reviews to every two years instead of the current three years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion, however, has its own “reform” bill, introduced by its favorite Democratic Senate and Republican House leaders. As is typical for Dominion, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1265" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1265</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (courtesy of Majority Leader Sen. Dick Saslaw, D-Fairfax) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1770" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1770</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kilgore) is long, dense and deadly effective in crushing competition and protecting profits. The bitter pill is sugarcoated with short-term rebates and concessions to minor reform proposals, such as biennial rate reviews in place of triennial reviews and consolidating many RACs into base rates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warring factions may be able to find common ground in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB2275" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2275</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kilgore) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1166" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1166</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax), legislation creating a structure for state energy planning.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1777" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1777</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (O’Quinn) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1075" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1075</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Sen. Frank Ruff, R-Mecklenburg) change how the SCC regulates rates of Appalachian Power – but not Dominion. They require the SCC to conduct “annual rate true-up reviews (ART reviews) of the rates, terms and conditions for generation and distribution services” by March 31, 2025 and annually after. They also remove the requirement for an integrated resource plan. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Retail choice</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Past years have seen efforts to restore the ability of customers to buy renewable energy from providers other than their own utilities, an important option for a resident or business that wants to buy renewable energy at a competitive rate. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1419" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1419</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Suetterlein) marks at least the fourth year in a row for this effort. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s “reform” bill, on the other hand, clamps down further on retail choice. In light of Youngkin’s support for retail choice in </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/18/you-call-that-an-energy-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">his energy plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it is interesting to see Republicans like Kilgore instead enabling Dominion’s anticompetitive efforts. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Goosing investments in solar and efficiency</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the passage of the federal Inflation Reduction Act last summer, renewable energy and energy efficiency tax credits are more generous and easier to access than ever before. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB848" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 848</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1852" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1852</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Del. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suhas </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Subramanyam, D-Loudoun) direct the Commission on School Construction and Modernization to figure out how to help schools take full advantage of onsite solar. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HJ545" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Joint Resolution 545</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (proposed by Del. Briana Sewell, D-Prince William) directs the Department of Energy to study barriers to clean energy investments by localities and their residents and issue recommendations to help. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1333" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1333</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (introduced by Sen. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghazala </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hashmi, D-Richmond) creates a program within the Department of Energy to be known as the Commonwealth Solar and Economic Development Program. The program will implement solar, energy efficiency and other economic development projects in specified census tracts. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1323" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1323</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (McClellan) requires the SCC to</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">establish for Dominion Energy Virginia annual energy efficiency savings targets for customers who are low-income, elderly, disabled or veterans of military service. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB984" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 984</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Sen. Monty Mason, D-Williamsburg) clarifies that lease arrangements for onsite solar are legal, whether or not they’re net metered, including when battery storage is part of the project. It also ensures owners can be paid for grid services using the facilities. For context: Leasing has always been an option for onsite solar, but the IRA has increased interest in this approach. It is considered especially attractive for residential projects that, except when the customer is low-income, are barred by Virginia law from using third-party power purchase agreements.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hj487&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Joint Resolution 487</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Marshall) directs the Department of Transportation to study the idea of putting solar panels in highway medians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=231&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2355&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 2355</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (put forth by Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk) is a consumer-protection effort for buyers of rooftop solar and other small arrays, who have sometimes been the victims of unscrupulous companies that overcharge and under-deliver.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shared solar</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has been wading into community solar like a child at the seashore, dipping a toe in and then running away again and again, without ever truly entering the water. A 2020 law establishing a “shared solar” program in Dominion territory was supposed to get us swimming. At the SCC, however, Dominion won the right to impose such a high minimum bill as to make the program unworkable for any but low-income customers, who are exempt from the minimum bill.   </span></p>

<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1266" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1266</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Surovell) attempts to address the problems with the shared solar program in Dominion territory. Surovell was the author of the 2020 law and criticized the SCC’s action for making shared solar unavailable to anyone other than low-income residents. His approach would limit the minimum bill to more than twice the basic customer charge, while also increasing the size of the program to at least 10% of the utility’s peak load and allowing non-jurisdictional customers like local governments to participate. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1083" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1083</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (co-authored by Sens. Edwards and Surovell) creates a shared solar program in Appalachian Power territory. It builds on the framework of the existing program in Dominion territory, but the minimum bill is limited to $20. It also seeks to prevent the interconnection problems that industry members have complained about by limiting costs and requirements to those “consistent with generally accepted industry practices in markets with significant penetration levels of distributed generation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the House side, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1853" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1853</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Del. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun) combines both Senate bills into one bill that addresses both Dominion and Appalachian Power. For both, it limits the minimum bill to two times the basic customer charge, and it includes the interconnection language. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Offshore wind</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1441" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1441</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (patroned by Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton) moves up the VCEA’s deadline for offshore wind farm construction from 2034 to 2024, a change I don’t understand at all, given that the current timeline calls for completion of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project (CVOW) in 2026. The bill also requires that when Dominion seeks cost recovery, the SCC must give preference “for generating facilities utilizing energy derived from offshore wind that maximize economic benefits to the Commonwealth, such as benefits arising from the construction and operation of such facilities and the manufacture of wind turbine generator components.” I look forward to learning what’s behind that, too. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1854" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1854</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Subramanyam) seeks annual reports from the SCC on the progress of CVOW, including “the status and the anticipated environmental impacts and benefits of such projects” that  “analyze the current and projected capital costs and consumer rate impacts associated with such projects.” It also wants “an analysis of the ownership structure chosen by an electric utility for previously approved wind energy projects and the costs, benefits, and risks for consumers associated with utility-owned and third-party-owned projects.” This analysis would compare the Virginia project with other U.S. projects, potentially a useful analytical tool for the next offshore wind project that comes along. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1797" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1797</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (by Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper) declares that ratepayers will be held harmless if CVOW’s annual net capacity factor falls below 42% as measured on a three-year rolling average. The capacity factor is the average output of the wind turbines as a percentage of their full potential. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its filing with the SCC, Dominion projected CVOW would hit that 42% mark. If wind speeds turn out to be stronger than projected, the turbines will produce more energy at a lower cost.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If the wind (or the machinery) doesn’t meet expectations, the capacity factor will be lower and costs will be higher. The bill would make Dominion absorb the loss in that event. However, the SCC </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/15/regulators-approve-offshore-wind-settlement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">did just resolve this issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a way that takes account of both ratepayer interests and the newness of the technology, making it unlikely that many legislators will want to revisit this topic.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Residential PACE</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB949" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 949</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Petersen) makes homeowners eligible for property-assessed clean energy (PACE) programs, which provide low-cost financing for energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades. Currently PACE loans are only available to commercial customers. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data centers</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/12/09/virginia-has-a-data-center-problem/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a data center problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Northern Virginia hosts the largest concentration of data centers in the world, and the energy they consume now amounts to 21% of Dominion’s load. This growth has happened with no state oversight; indeed, it’s been goosed by a billion dollars’ worth of state tax incentives over the past decade. Meeting the energy demand of data centers requires more generation and more transmission lines, usually paid for by all utility customers. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+SJ240" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Joint Resolution 240</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Sen. Chap Petersen, D-Fairfax, and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+HJ522" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Joint Resolution 522</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Danica Roem, D-Manassas, task the Department of Energy with studying data centers’ impact on Virginia’s environment, energy supply, electricity rates and ability to meet climate targets. The bills also ask for recommendations on whether tax incentives should be conditioned on use of renewable energy or on meeting siting criteria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Roem and Petersen also have bills that deal with specific siting issues, mostly unrelated to energy. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB1078" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Bill 1078</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Petersen) limits areas where data centers can be sited (e.g., not near parks and battlefields, a barb likely aimed at the Prince William Gateway project). However, it also requires localities to conduct site assessments for impacts on carbon emissions as well as water resources and agriculture. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Return of the gas ban ban </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year the natural gas industry tried to get a law passed to ban localities from prohibiting gas connections in new buildings. Some cities in other states have done that to protect the health and safety of residents and protect the climate; meanwhile, about 20 red states have passed laws to prevent their local governments from doing it. But no Virginia locality has attempted to ban gas connections, in part because as a Dillon Rule state, our local governments don’t appear to have that authority. That isn’t stopping the gas industry from seeking to ban bans here; </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+HB1783" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1783</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (O’Quinn) would do just that. Obnoxiously, it calls the right to use gas “energy justice,” which is surely the best reason to oppose it.  </span></p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Virginia General Assembly convenes next week for the 2023 session, Republicans will once again try to undo the commonwealth’s framework for a transition to renewable energy. Led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin, they will attack Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) and continue seeking ways to keep a money-losing </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/23/dominion-wants-wise-county-coal-plant-to-stay-as-is/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coal plant in Wise County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Virginia’s largest utility has already decided that renewable energy, especially solar, is the future. Dominion Energy’s just-released </span><a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/-/media/pdfs/global/company/esg/2022-climate-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate Report 2022</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> projects that under every set of assumptions modeled, solar energy will become the mainstay of its electricity generation fleet no later than 2040. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for coal, it disappears from the energy mix by 2030 even in a scenario that assumes no change from present policy, in spite of the fact that the VCEA allows the Wise County coal plant to operate until 2045. As for fracked gas, it hangs on longer but in ever-smaller amounts, mostly to help meet winter peak demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion modeled three scenarios for this report. The “current policy” scenario assumes the policy landscape and technology options stay the same as they are presently, and that Dominion does its part in driving a global temperature increase of 2.1°C by 2050. That’s in keeping with Virginia’s climate law, and also with Dominion’s internal commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That much warming is not a good outcome, considering the climate chaos the planet is experiencing today with </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-06/global-warming-turned-2022-into-a-chronicle-of-climate-chaos" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">barely over 1 degree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of warming. Yet even under a 2.1°C scenario, Dominion’s model predicts solar energy will provide 40% of the electricity supply by 2040, followed by nuclear at 30% and (offshore) wind at 19%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “emerging technologies” scenario also assumes a temperature increase of 2.1°C by 2050, but adjusts for the likelihood that technological change will lead to “advanced dispatchable zero-carbon technology” options that could displace much of the need for energy storage. These might include hydrogen, carbon sequestration and storage, and methane gas produced as the result of poor animal waste disposal practices at factory farms — what Dominion calls renewable natural gas, or RNG. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small modular reactors, SMRs, are not included in this scenario (and are hardly mentioned at all in the report), perhaps because operating them as peaker plants would be crazy expensive. Even without SMRs, though, the report says overall cost savings would be slight for this scenario, and solar would still be the leading source of electricity by 2040. </span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KnydVJohVQ"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/07/gov-youngkin-wants-a-small-modular-reactor-what-exactly-is-that/">Gov. Youngkin wants a small modular reactor. What exactly is that?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Gov. Youngkin wants a small modular reactor. What exactly is that?&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/11/07/gov-youngkin-wants-a-small-modular-reactor-what-exactly-is-that/embed/#?secret=e5f4xI1MY7#?secret=KnydVJohVQ" data-secret="KnydVJohVQ" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the report models an “accelerated transition” scenario that reduces emissions more aggressively, in line with an effort to keep the global temperature increase to 1.5°C by 2050. This is the upper bound of warming considered tolerable by many climate scientists, but it would require Dominion’s electricity business to reach net zero by 2035. Dominion’s model shows solar would make up nearly two-thirds of the electric supply in that scenario. Offshore wind would be held to just 17%, apparently because at that point more wouldn’t be needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’d argue that offshore wind should carry more of the load to create a more balanced portfolio, but it’s a moot point: The report writers clearly think this scenario is just a thought exercise. The scenario consistent with keeping global warming to 1.5°C is described in a way that seems intended to discourage anyone from pursuing the matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The heavier reliance on renewable capacity in this scenario,” it warns, “would require significantly greater capital investment at a much more rapid pace in preparation for a net zero mix by 2035. … Achieving such a rapid pace of emissions reductions would require predictable, dependable, and rapid wholesale shifts in public policy and technology advancements capable of maintaining system reliability and customer affordability. Also necessary would be supportive regulatory treatment and timely permitting for significant near-term zero-carbon infrastructure development and transmission system enhancements.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the report seems to say, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fuggedaboutit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s just too hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that feels defeatist, it’s worth remembering how far Dominion has come to reach a point where it is even writing climate reports, not to mention declaring on page 1 that “climate change presents one of the greatest challenges of our time, and we take seriously our leadership role in helping to mitigate it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is new, and you have to look back only a decade to appreciate how radical this declaration is. When 2013 opened, Dominion had just completed construction of that regrettable coal plant in Wise County and had begun a fracked gas plant building spree that would continue even after solar emerged as the cheapest source of new electricity in Virginia. Climate activists like myself were dismissed when we warned that new gas plants would be reduced to </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2013/09/04/dominions-giant-concrete-paperweight/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">giant concrete paperweights</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> well before the end of their design life, leaving ratepayers paying off stranded assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in 2016, when now-CEO Bob Blue was president of Dominion Virginia Power, Blue was </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2016/05/19/inside-the-minds-of-dominions-leaders-vacant-space-where-climate-thinking-should-be/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proclaiming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> natural gas “the new default fuel” for electric generation. As late as the spring of 2020, the company’s integrated resource plan still called for </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2020/05/18/what-part-of-zero-doesnt-dominion-understand/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building more gas plants.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> That plan acknowledged the strategy would violate Virginia’s new climate law, so it argued against the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet I suspect Blue may deserve credit for the remarkable about-face at Dominion beginning in 2020. That summer Dominion Energy began significantly reducing its investments in fossil gas outside of the electric sector, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/07/05/dominion-cancels-atlantic-coast-pipeline-announces-sale-of-natural-gas-transmission-and-storage-assets/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scrapping plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline and selling off its gas transmission and storage assets. That year it also </span><a href="https://www.naturalgasintel.com/berkshire-hathaway-taking-over-cove-point-lng-from-dominion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> half of its interest in the Cove Point liquified natural gas export facility. It is </span><a href="https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/dominion-energy-considering-sale-stake-cove-point-lng-project/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reportedly considering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> selling the other half now as part of what Blue called in November “a &#8216;top-to-bottom’ business review aimed at ensuring that it is best positioned to generate substantial long-term value for shareholders.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe Blue got religion on climate, maybe he’s just a savvy businessman. It’s a really good sign of the times that you can’t always tell the difference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, Dominion is stuck with a heck of a lot of gas generating plants that it has to justify </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">post hoc</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which helps to explain its lack of enthusiasm for the 1.5°C scenario. Another part of the explanation lies in Dominion’s remaining gas investments outside the electric sector. Although Dominion Energy Virginia is solely an electric utility and does not supply gas to retail customers in Virginia, a separate Dominion Energy subsidiary sells gas in other states. So far these assets don’t seem to be going the way of the gas transmission business and Cove Point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s climate report tries valiantly to justify holding onto its retail gas business. The report declares, “Natural gas is also part of our long-term vision and consistent with our Net Zero commitment.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure, and the Tooth Fairy is real. Of the greenhouse gas reduction approaches cited — fixing leaks, making “renewable” methane from waste products, blending hydrogen into pipelines, and using creative carbon accounting with “offsets” — none make sense either economically or from a climate standpoint. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe he cares about climate, but apparently Blue doesn’t want to give up yet on a profitable business. Fortunately, at least for the planet, the retail gas business is about to enter a terminal decline as homes and businesses electrify. Getting out now would be the smart move from both the business and climate perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because what will eventually power all these homes, no matter which scenario you choose?  Renewable energy, and especially solar.</span></p>

<p>One seems like a good problem to have, at least if you are a locality looking to attract business.</p>
<p>Data centers pay a lot of local taxes while requiring little in the way of local services, and the steady buildout has supported <a href="https://www.nvtc.org/NVTC/News/News_Articles/NVTC_releases_2022_data_center_report.aspx" target="_blank">thousands of construction jobs</a> across the region. Indeed, so many data center companies have chosen to locate in Northern Virginia that we now host the largest concentration of data centers in the world. No wonder other regions of the commonwealth are angling to bring data centers to their neck of the woods too.</p>
<p>But there’s more to being the data center capital of the world than just raking in cash. To drive through Data Center Alley is to witness suburban sprawl on steroids, with its attendant deforestation, loss of farmland and loss of wildlife habitat. The environmental destruction doesn’t stop at a facility’s property line; a single building covers acres of land, causing massive rainwater runoff problems that can impact streams and drinking water resources miles downstream.</p>
<p>Other problems are unique to the industry. Cooling the servers requires a single data center to consume as much water <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/drought-stricken-communities-push-back-against-data-centers-n1271344" target="_blank">as a city of 30,000-50,000 people</a>, and giant fans make the surrounding area <a href="https://wtop.com/local/2022/09/as-data-centers-proliferate-neighbors-knock-the-noise/" target="_blank">noisy</a> day and night. The average data center has so many backup diesel generators onsite that it requires a <a href="https://www.bayjournal.com/news/growth_conservation/virginia-s-data-centers-computing-the-costs/article_aea2f2be-41e3-11ea-9442-2b6622149089.html" target="_blank">major air source permit</a> from the Department of Environmental Quality. The generators have to be started up regularly to ensure they will work in an outage. Multiply those startups by the total number of data centers in Northern Virginia, and the result is poorer air quality across the region.</p>
<p>Moreover, data centers require astonishing amounts of energy to power their operations and cool their servers. The industry uses over 12% of Dominion Energy Virginia’s total electricity supply, more than any other business category. Electric cooperatives supply more. <a href="https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/cloud/article/11427486/after-record-growth-in-2021-data-centers-are-building-bigger-for-2022" target="_blank">Industry sources</a> put Virginia’s total data center load at 1,688 megawatts as of 2021 — equivalent to about 1.6 million homes. Feeding ever more of these energy hogs requires utilities to build new electric generation and transmission lines, with costs and impacts borne by all ratepayers.</p>
<p>Many data center operators have pledged to run their operations on renewable energy, but only a few major tech companies have followed through on building solar facilities in Virginia. Indeed, their energy appetite is so great that if all Virginia data centers ran only on solar energy with battery backup, meeting their current demand would require all the <a href="https://www.seia.org/states-map" target="_blank">solar currently installed</a> in Virginia, Maryland, DC, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware put together. (For you energy nerds, I’m assuming a 25% capacity factor for solar; that is, meeting 1,688 megawatts of data center load would take 6,752 megawatts of solar.)</p>
<p>That’s not a reason to send data centers somewhere else — unless, of course, we’re talking about data centers that host cryptocurrency mining (and yes, <a href="https://zone5.tech/" target="_blank">they exist in Virginia</a>, with <a href="https://www.govtech.com/products/bitcoin-mining-company-sets-up-in-rural-virginia-county" target="_blank">more on the way</a>). Those data centers we should certainly send elsewhere, preferably to Mars, unless scientists find life there, and in that case to the nearest black hole in outer space. As for the others, we’d just like them to be part of the climate solution rather than adding to our carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Why are data centers so keen to locate in Northern Virginia? Historically the draws were the fiber-optic network in Northern Virginia, proximity to Washington, D.C., relatively low-cost energy and a concerted <a href="https://biz.loudoun.gov/2014/04/07/loudoun-county-streamlines-data-center-development-process/" target="_blank">early effort</a> on the part of Loudoun County to make locating here as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Then there are the state subsidies. Since 2010, Virginia has offered tax incentives to data centers that locate in the commonwealth. The data center sales and use tax exemption is by far Virginia’s largest economic development incentive. It’s also an increasingly expensive one, rising from $30 million in outlays in 2010 to $138 million in 2020. A <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt557.pdf" target="_blank">state audit</a> showed Virginia taxpayers had provided over $830 million to data center operators through 2020; by now the total is certainly over $1 billion.</p>
<p>A 2019 <a href="http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt518-1.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found that Virginia received back only 72 cents for every dollar of the data center tax incentive while creating very few jobs. That money-losing proposition was judged “moderately successful.”</p>
<p>Thus far, opposition to data centers has tended to be local and focused mainly on land use issues. Preservationists have been at the forefront of opposition to Prince William County’s proposed Digital Gateway, a data center development across more than 2,100 acres in an area known as the “Rural Crescent.” The development would abut parkland and Manassas National Battlefield, leading opponents <a href="https://energynews.us/2022/08/23/virginia-activists-fight-to-protect-green-space-from-data-center-development/" target="_blank">to call this</a> a new Battle of Manassas. Citizens <a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/citizens-file-lawsuit-against-prince-william-county-chair-supervisors-over-digital-gateway-vote/article_314cbcc8-724b-11ed-bea9-6738c1977124.html" target="_blank">have sued</a> the board of county supervisors for approving an amendment to the county’s comprehensive plan that allows the data center expansion.</p>

<p>The battle has spilled across the border into Fairfax County, whose leaders <a href="https://www.fairfaxtimes.com/articles/fairfax_county/plans-for-prince-william-gateway-could-threaten-fairfax-county-water-supply/article_444054ba-6699-11ed-a9e4-03f3177ff2f3.html" target="_blank">worry</a> that stormwater runoff from the development will pollute the county’s main drinking water source, the Occoquan Reservoir.</p>
<p>The divide on data center siting is polarizing, but it isn’t partisan. The Democratic majority on the Prince William board of supervisors <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/11/02/prince-william-approves-digital-gateway-plan-to-meet-rising-data-center-demand/" target="_blank">approved</a> the Gateway project over opposition from Republican Supervisor Yesli Vega and state Del. Danica Roem, a Democrat. In a <a href="https://www.princewilliamtimes.com/opinion/guest-opinion-there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-green-data-center/article_e961ae52-5628-11ed-8a0e-ebf92eb8dd9a.html" target="_blank">scathing op-ed</a>, Roem argues that there’s no such thing as a green data center.</p>
<p>Since data centers provide essential services and have to locate somewhere, the answer isn’t to ban them from the state (crypto-mining operations excepted!). A better approach would be for Virginia to guide development away from overburdened areas to parts of the state that are desperate for new businesses, and to link tax incentives to energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy and <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-commitment-to-climate-conscious-data-center-cooling/" target="_blank">reclaimed water</a>.</p>
<p>Right now Virginia is operating on auto-pilot, paying ever more in tax incentives and fueling conflict, sprawl and carbon emissions. That needs to change.</p>

(Norfolk Solar Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund) </p><p>After years of wrangling, Virginia finally allows certain customers of Dominion Energy Virginia to buy solar energy from independent providers of shared solar, also known as community solar.</p>
<p>Don’t applaud yet, though. Dominion has used the rulemaking process and its control over project interconnection to create hurdles for shared solar that lawmakers never anticipated. High minimum bills, prolonged interconnection study requirements and expensive equipment demands are stalling projects and could drive away all but the most tenacious developers.</p>
<p>The blow that received the most attention came during the rulemaking process. The State Corporation Commission decided Dominion could impose a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/10/14/dominion-shared-solar-minimum-bill-to-remain-55-10-per-month/" target="_blank">minimum bill averaging $55 per month</a> on most customers. The minimum bill is added to the cost of the electricity itself, making shared solar so expensive that the program simply won’t be offered to the general public.</p>
<p>However, lawmakers had included a provision exempting low- to moderate-income (LMI) participants from the minimum bill requirement. In effect, then, the <a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7_dh01!.PDF" target="_blank">SCC’s order</a> turned the shared solar program into a program just for LMI residents.</p>
<p>Indeed, the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/11/thousands-of-low-income-virginians-set-to-get-access-to-shared-solar/" target="_blank">first shared solar project</a> for LMI Virginians launched on Nov. 9 in Dumfries as a partnership between community solar developer Dimension Renewable Energy and low-income housing provider Community Housing Partners. Subscribers are told to expect savings of 10% on their electricity bills. The partners are signing up participants now but have not broken ground on a solar facility to serve them.</p>
<p>Sen. Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, the author of the <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-594.3/" target="_blank">law</a> creating the shared solar program, attended the launch of Dimension’s project to share in the celebration. But he still believes the program should be available to everyone. He confirmed to me he is working with the community solar industry to develop legislation addressing the minimum bill problem.</p>
<p>Surovell says he continues to think a minimum bill is necessary; the question is what fee is “commercially feasible to community solar programs” while still capturing “a fair amount of system costs and legacy expenses” borne by Dominion in providing service to participants when the solar facility isn’t generating electricity.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Interconnection woes: delays, high costs and &#8216;dark fiber&#8217;</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Even if Surovell can thread that needle, the minimum bill is only the most visible problem facing shared solar in Dominion’s territory. The solar facilities have to connect to the grid, which puts Dominion in charge of the interconnection process. Developers say they are encountering long delays, high costs and unreasonable equipment requirements.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the State Corporation Commission <a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/777501!.PDF" target="_blank">opened a docket</a> to solicit feedback on the interconnection process — and the result was an outpouring of complaints.</p>
<p>As described in comments from the solar industry, Dominion requires cost-prohibitive “dark fiber” for grid protection in place of a much less expensive industry-standard approach. Dominion also lags in conducting the studies that every new project proposal must undergo at the developer’s cost, resulting in timelines that stretch 16 months or more. Additional facilities that would use the same substation aren’t considered until the study process for the first one is complete, creating further delays.</p>
<p>Developers also aren’t told until the final stage how much Dominion expects to charge them to interconnect their array — and even then, Dominion adds a disclaimer that its estimate is not binding. That uncertainty, says the industry, makes projects hard to finance and risky for developers.</p>
<p>These inefficiencies and unnecessary expenses drive up project costs and make distributed solar more expensive for customers, when it is possible at all. Tony Smith, president of solar developer Secure Futures, told me his company wanted to build a 1 megawatt shared solar facility to serve LMI customers in Augusta County. They secured the site and permits before learning that Dominion would require dark fiber and planned to charge them $1 million for the interconnection, an amount so high as to scuttle the project.</p>
<p>(For context, <a href="https://www.solarreviews.com/blog/what-is-a-solar-farm-do-i-need-one" target="_blank">solar industry estimates</a> put the entire cost of developing community-scale solar at an average of $1.4 million per megawatt.)</p>
<p>Smith says larger projects may be able to absorb exorbitant interconnection fees, but smaller projects cannot. In any case, high interconnection costs inevitably mean higher costs for customers.</p>
<p>Industry comments note areas where Dominion has tried to resolve issues, in particular to speed up the study timelines. But regarding other requirements, particularly those that impose the highest costs, the utility shows little willingness to budge. In some instances, the company even seems to be using its interconnection power to make private developers shoulder its own grid upgrade costs. It’s hard not to suspect that Dominion is perfectly happy making other people’s solar projects more expensive.</p>
<p>The solar industry’s brief describes steps taken in other states to make the process fairer, faster and less expensive. But if the <a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7nqp01!.PDF" target="_blank">staff report</a> of the Division of Public Utility Regulation is any indication, the SCC is more likely to take a slower approach involving working groups, pilot studies and a multistep process. Smith says all this will take many years, by which time shared solar developers will have given up on Virginia and taken their business to friendlier states. He’d like to see the General Assembly address the worst problems.</p>
<p>Surovell says he has “heard about” the interconnection issues but “ha(s)n’t focused on it yet.” Charlie Coggeshall, mid-Atlantic director of the Coalition for Community Solar Access, told me that “interconnection is a hurdle for shared solar in Virginia and absolutely in need of improvements,” but said his organization is focused on the SCC process and for now has no plans to pursue a legislative fix.</p>
<p>Dominion serves about two-thirds of Virginia customers, so solving the minimum bill and interconnection problems would open shared solar to a broad swath of residents across the state. That still leaves out the other third. Advocates <a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2022/11/09/shared-solar-is-coming-to-virginia-just-not-all-of-virginia/" target="_blank">hope to expand</a> the availability of shared solar into Appalachian Power territory and that of Virginia’s electric cooperatives.</p>
<p>A few co-ops launched their own community solar programs pre-pandemic, but most don’t offer one and apparently don’t want to. As for Appalachian Power, it has consistently opposed community solar, saying it can’t afford to lose customers. (On the other hand, Appalachian Power does not require installation of dark fiber as a condition of interconnection, in that respect making it friendlier to distributed generation — just not shared solar projects.)</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Multifamily shared solar scores a win, regardless of income level</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>While shared solar faces an uphill battle, some good news came in a second case implementing a related program, this one authorized by 2020’s Solar Freedom legislation and designed for onsite solar at apartment buildings and condominiums. The multifamily shared solar (MFSS) program makes it possible for a landlord or condo association to install a solar facility to serve just its own residents. This program occupies a middle ground between community solar and net metering, and the <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-585.1:12/" target="_blank">enabling legislation</a> allows Dominion to impose an administrative fee but not a minimum bill or any other charges.</p>
<p>Early on, the SCC had indicated a willingness to allow Dominion to shoehorn the components of the shared solar law’s minimum bill into the MFSS administrative fee. That would have certainly been the end of the program right there. In its <a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7_d%2401!.PDF" target="_blank">final order</a>, however, a common-sense definition of “administrative fee” prevailed, and the SCC ruled that Dominion could not stuff its costs of doing business into the fee.</p>
<p>The SCC still set the MFSS administrative fee at a curiously high $13.40 per month, accepting Dominion’s argument that it would have to do all this billing manually. The SCC also decided customers should pay certain “non-bypassable charges” amounting to an average of about $3 per month. The law doesn’t authorize these charges, but the SCC reasoned that it doesn’t prohibit them, either.</p>
<p>Even with Dominion taking $16 or so, the economics would not seem prohibitive. Developers caution, however, that the limited subscriber base for any MFSS project makes this program difficult to work with, even if the building is large and the property can accommodate a fair-sized solar facility. And even onsite solar arrays aren’t necessarily immune to interconnection woes.</p>
<p>Still, there is plenty of customer interest in the multifamily program, especially from condominium associations that may be able to finance the projects themselves. With any luck, they will pave the way for others to follow.</p>

(Getty Images) </p><p>Washington Gas has been emailing its Virginia customers this month to offer them rebates if they buy new gas appliances, including home heating equipment (up to $700) and water heaters (up to $400). What the message doesn’t say is that this is a terrible deal. Customers will be able to get far bigger incentives if they wait until January and buy electric equipment instead.</p>
<p>Under the just-passed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Uncle Sam will provide tax credits of up to $2,000 per year for electric heat pumps that provide both heating and air conditioning as well as heat pump water heaters. For lower-income customers, the incentives are even greater and will be available as upfront rebates. If you’re converting from gas and your electric panel isn’t sized to handle the extra electric load, the IRA will help with an upgrade. (For a full rundown of rebates and tax credits for homes, see this <a href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/app/ira-calculator" target="_blank">list</a> from Rewiring America.)</p>
<p>It used to be that gas furnaces were more efficient and cheaper to operate than most electric heating options, but today <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/heat-pump-buying-guide/" target="_blank">the reverse is true</a>: An EnergyStar heat pump uses energy more efficiently and costs less to operate than a fossil fuel furnace or boiler. A <a href="https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/plumbing/heat-pump-water-heaters/" target="_blank">heat pump water heater</a>, which I’d never even heard of until recently, is more efficient than either gas or a standard electric hot water heater and, again, saves money on operation.</p>
<p>Advances in heat pump technology and induction stoves, concerns about climate change and growing awareness of the dangers of <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2022/10/14/23393294/climate-buildings-gas-stoves-electrification" target="_blank">burning fossil fuels indoors</a> mean the switchover from gas to electricity would have happened without the IRA. But the IRA’s rebates are expected to goose the transition and <a href="https://rmi.org/the-inflation-reduction-act-could-transform-the-us-buildings-sector/" target="_blank">transform the building sector</a>.</p>
<p>Many consumers haven’t heard about the IRA’s rebates yet, and they may not have given much thought to home electrification. They need this information, but they sure won’t get it from their gas company.</p>
<p>Washington Gas is pushing its gas appliance rebates now for an even bigger reason, though, and one that makes it especially important that customers give them a pass: Installing an expensive new gas furnace locks you into the company’s fond embrace for the life of the furnace, no matter how high natural gas prices go.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that electric appliances will further tie you to your electric utility (unless you have solar panels), and electricity rates have been going up as well. But electricity rates are going up mainly because fossil fuel costs have skyrocketed. Dominion Energy Virginia, for example, cited a <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/19/your-electric-bills-are-skyrocketing-blame-our-failure-to-invest-in-renewable-energy/" target="_blank">100% increase</a> in the price of natural gas when it asked for a rate hike this summer. As the electric grid gets greener year by year, lower-priced wind and solar energy will have a moderating effect on electricity prices. Your gas utility, on the other hand, will never have anything to sell you but gas.</p>
<p>It gets worse. Gas companies have to maintain their network of pipelines and other infrastructure regardless of how many customers they have. Those costs will be spread over a shrinking rate base as more and more customers switch over to electricity, raising rates for the remaining customers. If you buy a new gas furnace now, you will be trapped in that shrinking pool of customers, paying ever more to maintain pipelines.</p>
<p>Today, Washington Gas charges customers a flat “system charge” of $11.25 per month, plus supply and distribution costs based on how much gas is used that month. Customers who electrify their homes escape the monthly system charge and gain the convenience of dealing with just one utility. But the real savings come in not being part of a shrinking rate base paying an ever-larger share of the gas company’s fixed costs.</p>
<p>That makes Washington Gas’s rebate offer doubly dangerous for customers who don’t know about the IRA. Someone whose old gas furnace is on the fritz might see the email and decide to use that small rebate to buy a new gas furnace, when they would be far better off keeping the old one limping along for a few more months. Come 2023, they would then reap the benefit of an electric heat pump with a much larger rebate or tax credit.</p>
<p>Consumers are set to save a lot of money and energy under the IRA’s incentives for home electrification — but not if they get locked into fossil fuels first.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Governor Glenn Youngkin issued a press release on October 3 presenting what he says is his energy plan. Accompanying the press release was 26 pages labeled “2022 Virginia Energy Plan,” but that can’t be what he’s referring to. I mean, the Virginia Code is pretty specific about what makes up an energy plan, and this isn’t it.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title45.2/chapter17/section45.2-1710/" target="_blank">Virginia law</a>, the energy plan must identify steps the state will take over the next 10 years consistent with the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy’s goal of a net-zero carbon economy by 2045 “in all sectors, including the electric power, transportation, industrial, agricultural, building, and infrastructure sectors.”  Not only does Youngkin’s document not do that, it doesn’t even mention <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/45.2-1706.1/" target="_blank">the policy</a> it’s supposed to implement.</p>
<p>It’s also missing critical pieces. The plan is supposed to include a statewide <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/10.1-1307.04/" target="_blank">inventory of greenhouse gas emissions</a>, but it’s nowhere to be found. The inventory is the responsibility of the Department of Environmental Quality, which reports previous inventories on its <a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/air/air-quality-monitoring-assessments/air-quality-reports" target="_blank">website</a> from 2005, 2010 and 2018. The one specifically required to be completed by October 1, 2022 isn’t there, nor is there any indication it’s in the works and just unfortunately delayed. Did I miss some fine print about how the requirement doesn’t apply if the governor is a Republican?</p>
<p>In fact, there is no discussion about climate change in Youngkin’s energy plan.  The word “climate” appears nowhere. He simply ignores the problem: a modern Nero, fiddling while the planet burns.</p>
<p>Instead, Youngkin’s document mostly attacks the laws Virginia has passed in recent years to implement its decarbonization goals, including the Virginia Clean Economy Act, legislation allowing the state to participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the Clean Cars law. In their place he offers a bunch of random ideas — some with merit, some without, some spinning off on tangents.</p>
<p>I did not really expect a conservative Republican with presidential aspirations to embrace all the recommendations for the energy plan that I <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/23/will-governor-youngkins-energy-plan-look-anything-like-what-the-law-requires/" target="_blank">laid out last month</a>, or those from the many environmental, faith and consumer groups that support Virginia’s clean energy transition. Going further and faster down the road to decarbonization is a tall order for politicians beholden to fossil fuel interests, no matter how much it would benefit the public.</p>
<p>Yet Youngkin doesn’t have a lot of ammunition to use against the switch to renewable energy. With soaring coal and natural gas prices, it’s hard to keep pretending that fossil fuels are low-cost. The insistence that we need them for reliability is the only straw left to grasp at.</p>
<p>https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/regulators-approve-dominion-bill-increase-for-rising-fuel-costs-appalachian-power-also-seeking-hike/</p>
<p>And indeed, underlying Younkin’s attack on the VCEA is a misunderstanding of how grid operators manage electricity. The critique boils down to “baseload good, intermittent bad.” But baseload is not the point; meeting demand is the point. Demand fluctuates hugely by day and hour. If grid operators had nothing to work with but slow-ramping coal plants or on/off nuclear reactors and no storage, they’d have as much trouble matching demand as if they had nothing but renewable energy and no storage. Pairing low-cost wind and solar with batteries makes them dispatchable — that is, better than baseload.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there aren’t good reasons to invest in higher-cost resources, but “baseload” is a red herring that stinks up Youngkin’s entire argument.</p>
<p>To his credit — and notwithstanding his “baseload” fixation — Youngkin supports Virginia’s move into offshore wind energy even with the high cost of the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project and other early U.S. developments. (The plan notes that Virginia’s project will be the largest “in the Free World,” a weirdly retro way to tell us <a href="https://gwec.net/offshore-wind-industry-enjoys-best-ever-year-with-21-1-gw-of-installations-and-prepares-for-new-era-of-growth/" target="_blank">China has leapt far ahead</a> in installing offshore wind.)</p>
<p>The plan also supports removing barriers to customer purchases of solar energy, including shared solar and a greater ability for renewable energy suppliers to compete with utilities for retail sales. This is all phrased as a consumer choice issue rather than an endorsement of greater utility investments in solar; regardless, these would be welcome moves.</p>
<p>It’s also good to see the governor’s endorsement of rate reform. Republicans have been at least as much to blame as Democrats for Dominion Energy’s success in getting laws passed that let it bilk ratepayers. It will be interesting to see if Youngkin actually pursues the reforms he touts.</p>
<p>Less encouraging are Youngkin’s desires to jump into hydrogen (I’m guessing not the green kind, since we hardly have an excess of renewable energy) and, worse, to deploy “the nation’s first” commercial small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) in Southwest Virginia within 10 years.</p>
<p>You know what will happen there, right? Ratepayers will foot the bill, and it will be very expensive.</p>
<p>But unlike offshore wind, SMRs aren’t proven technology; they remain firmly in the research phase. The U.S. Department of Energy is hoping for a demonstration project <a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/advanced-small-modular-reactors-smrs" target="_blank">“this decade.”</a> If successful, the industry believes SMRs will eventually be able to produce electricity at a price that’s only two or three times that of solar and wind energy. Which begs an obvious question: <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/why-small-modular-nuclear-reactors-wont-help-counter-climate-crisis" target="_blank">Is there a reason to build SMRs</a>?</p>
<p>Nor has anyone figured out the nagging problem of what to do with the radioactive waste, including the waste piling up at today’s nuclear plants because it’s too dangerous to move and there’s no place to put it. So Youngkin’s plan also “calls for developing spent nuclear fuel recycling technologies that offer the promise of a zero-carbon emission energy system with minimal waste and a closed-loop supply chain.” Great idea! But how about focusing on that first, Governor?</p>
<p>That’s not where Younkin is putting his focus, though. Last week, he proposed spending $10 million on a Virginia Power Innovation Fund, with half of that earmarked for SMR research and development.  The <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/october/name-941293-en.html" target="_blank">announcement</a> said nothing about waste.</p>
<p>Look, I happen to know some earnest climate advocates who believe SMRs are the silver bullet we’ve been waiting for. I follow the research with an open mind while also noting the astonishing advances in renewable energy technology announced almost daily. But the climate crisis is here and now. We can’t afford to press pause on known carbon-free technologies for 10 years in the hope that something even better will pan out.</p>
<p>Investing in research and development of new technologies is an important role for government, but kicking the climate can down the road isn’t an option. Rather than attacking our energy transition, Youngkin would have done more for Virginia by using his plan to build on it.</p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when state law requires an anti-clean energy governor to draw up a plan for a zero-carbon energy economy? We’re about to find out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia gives a new governor until Oct. 1 of his first year in office to</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title45.2/chapter17/section45.2-1710/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">write a plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “identifying actions over a 10-year period consistent with the goal of the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy set forth in § </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/45.2-1706.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">45.2-1706.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to achieve, no later than 2045, a net-zero carbon energy economy for all sectors, including the electricity, transportation, building, agricultural, and industrial sectors.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Glenn Youngkin is hardly a likely source for actions addressing the climate crisis. During the campaign he</span><a href="https://whro.org/news/local-news/23546-what-virginia-gubernatorial-candidates-say-about-sea-level-rise" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">claimed he didn’t know</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what was causing climate change. He condemned the Virginia Clean Economy Act, the law providing for our transition to 100% clean electricity. He hired as a senior adviser Andrew Wheeler, the guy President Trump put in charge of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to undermine environmental laws. He continues to try to pull Virginia out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, legally or (</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/09/01/youngkin-administration-outlines-plan-to-withdraw-virginia-from-carbon-market-by-regulation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as it appears now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) illegally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if he doesn’t like Virginia’s current legal framework for the energy transition, does he have any better ideas?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His Aug. 19</span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/august/name-938701-en.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">press release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the topic suggests not. It quotes him as saying, “Our priority is to have a comprehensive Virginia energy plan that considers all energy sources, provides transparent and data-driven information for Virginians about costs, and is an ‘all of the above’ approach.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The press release goes on to state, “The objectives of the energy plan will focus on lowering the cost of living, creating jobs, and bringing people to Virginia. Affordability, reliability, capacity, competition, environmental stewardship, choice, and innovation are the seven guiding principles that will inform Governor Youngkin’s ‘all of the above’ approach.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are all nice words, but the failure to mention cutting carbon is a glaring omission. Worse, “all of the above” is typically code-speak for supporting fossil fuels, as suggested by Youngkin’s</span><a href="https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/policy-regulation/virginia-gop-targets-clean-energy-law-but-options-for-rollback-are-limited/#gref" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the campaign that “we need to preserve our clean natural gas.” (“Clean natural gas” rolls off the conservative tongue so easily that it almost seems like a truth instead of an</span><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/super-potent-methane-in-atmosphere-oil-gas-drilling-ice-cores" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">oxymoron</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the energy plan falls short in meeting the statutory directive, Youngkin’s loyalty to the gas industry will be the likely reason. That’s a problem. The Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy makes it clear that the role of the energy plan is to guide the transition to a net-zero economy in which fossil fuels have little or no place. But as the RGGI fight shows, Youngkin isn’t the kind of guy who lets a law boss him around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the governor has good people at Virginia’s Department of Energy</span><a href="https://energy.virginia.gov/energy-efficiency/documents/2022%20VEP%20August%2024%20Informational%20Presentation.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">working on the plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and while they got a very late start, they have amassed a great deal of input from the public and stakeholder groups. The ideas are there if the governor chooses to be forward-thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And indeed, Youngkin’s “seven guiding principles” — affordability, reliability, capacity, competition, environmental stewardship, choice and innovation — could as easily support a renewables-focused strategy as one clinging to fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affordability?

Capacity, competition, environmental stewardship, choice and innovation? These principles support not just greater investment in renewables, but also the rest of the agenda laid out for the plan in the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy.</span></p>

Federal incentives will also support an emphasis on building solar and wind facilities in low-income areas and in areas of Southwest Virginia where coal employment has fallen steadily for more than two decades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, clean energy incentives will now be so numerous that Virginia’s energy department could do a great public service by developing a website with one-stop shopping for residents, businesses and local governments to understand what incentives exist, who qualifies, how to access them and how to find reputable companies to work with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia should also help residents save energy and money by closing the loopholes in our residential building code that make Virginia homes less efficient and less well-insulated than the national standard. Updates to the code should also help buyers by requiring that new homes be wired to accommodate solar and electric vehicles, and be either all-electric or easily converted to all-electric when the homeowner wants to make the switch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This last is especially important because methane is on its way out as a heat source in buildings. Technological innovation has made electric heat pumps, stoves and water heaters more efficient and safer than their gas counterparts. Now they will be cheaper too due to the</span><a href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/app/ira-calculator" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">federal rebates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> becoming available next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, consumers will increasingly abandon their gas utilities, and builders won’t connect new homes to gas lines. Within the 10-year planning frame of the energy plan, gas utilities serving residential and commercial customers will enter the first stage of a</span><a href="https://www.brattle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Future-of-Gas-Utilities-Series_Part-1.pdf" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">death spiral</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Rather than fighting against the inevitable, Virginia must help gas utilities make realistic plans for winding down business in a way that doesn’t leave local governments and taxpayers — </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electrification/as-the-wealthy-go-electric-who-will-pay-for-aging-gas-infrastructure?utm_campaign=canary&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=225106185&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9fsGMnNs2jviTgePseqXYCMMZIAJ4Jf_6tab7rK3MxDzzvbIL00s9aH5J6SJ4ioTkKucFAa6-JYjlfWSPU_G9COX2bqReKsQgxwING4UlVE040tBk&amp;utm_source=newsletter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">especially those least able to afford it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — paying for crumbling infrastructure and cleaning up the gas industry’s mess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This leaves a role for methane only in some industrial processes, where technological innovation will eventually make — but has not yet made —  gas obsolete. Yet this customer base is too small to support existing gas transmission infrastructure, let alone new pipelines like the Mountain Valley Pipeline. Again, Virginia should not allow its residents to be left holding the bag when these assets become stranded and owners go bankrupt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as technology will make natural gas in buildings obsolete, the same is happening with gasoline for vehicles. This spring Youngkin</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/06/17/under-new-law-virginias-government-fleet-is-poised-to-go-electric/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">signed bipartisan legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that requires state agencies to buy electric cars instead of gasoline-powered vehicles unless a calculation of the lifetime cost of ownership shows them to be more expensive.</span><a href="https://www.electrificationcoalition.org/bipartisan-bill-optimizing-virginias-vehicle-fleet-signed-as-gas-prices-soar/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bill proponents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expect electric vehicles will be the clear winners because their operating costs are up to 44% less.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s true for state agencies will be true for residents as well, particularly as federal rebates make both new and used electric vehicles more affordable. Virginia must ensure the widespread availability of EV charging, especially for multifamily housing residents and areas with only street parking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But cars should not have to be anyone’s only transportation choice, or their first choice. The energy plan should prioritize walking, bicycling, electric scooters and mass transit as ways to help residents save money and energy and make Virginia communities more attractive places to live. Electrifying bus fleets across the commonwealth will also result in cleaner air, especially in cities. Technology can help route planning to give more residents the option to take a bus, both within communities and between cities.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The common denominator: jobs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin says he wants to bring more people and more jobs to Virginia, and he understands the need to</span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/youngkin-plans-major-reform-of-virginias-workforce-development-efforts/article_4da658d0-e4c7-509f-9e62-4ffe764920fc.html" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">improve job training programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to better match trainees with employer needs. This is one more reason to align the energy plan with our ongoing energy transition. Careers in the solar and offshore wind industries are among the fastest-growing in the country, and the Inflation Reduction Act requires clean energy developers to meet prevailing wage and apprenticeship metrics to qualify for the maximum tax credits. As a result, clean energy jobs will provide upward mobility for young people, returning citizens and those changing careers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia attracted manufacturers and supply chain businesses when it committed to building its first offshore wind farm, and Hampton Roads’ role as a manufacturing hub will grow further if we raise our ambitions for future offshore wind development. New federal incentives for domestic manufacturing of clean energy components give manufacturers a reason to expand in states that want them. For example, Arizona-based First Solar has already announced plans to expand its solar module factory in Ohio and</span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/climate-law-incentives-prompt-first-solar-factory-expansion?utm_campaign=canary&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=224533712&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9srI4kP9kK6JAM7fXi-z9MA5ExryuSIKWaE9j7KkRco-QFdftMt1f6nzLXHQuX052jdfQHhoVP1q_WS7OoxNa8_DthNiHVuzeQuZ5NHQ10tsqthjM&amp;utm_source=newsletter" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">invest $1 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a new factory in the Southeast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fighting against the clean energy tide won’t gain Virginia anything but dirty air and a bad reputation. Leaning into the energy transition would allow Youngkin to meet his goals of creating good jobs, lowering energy costs and attracting people to Virginia.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p><p>It was the best of summers, it was the worst of summers. It was the summer the United Nations declared a healthy environment a universal human right, and a summer that shattered heat records across the globe. The U.S. enacted a historic climate bill not long after the Supreme Court struck down the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan. Climate scientists said there was still hope for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, while the American West’s worst drought in 1,200 years continued for its 22nd summer.</p>
<p>The struggle to keep climate change from spinning out of control feels nothing short of epic, as if ordinary mortals were powerless observers to a battle between giants that will determine whether and how we survive. Yet if we weren’t collectively doing what modern humans do — burning fossil fuels, clearing land for agriculture, raising and eating billions of animals, driving on the roads we paved, making things in factories, consuming and consuming — there would be no epic struggle. We are the giants.</p>
<p>But being integral to the problem also makes every person integral to where we go from here.  Powerlessness is an illusion. Like a murmuration of starlings wheeling through the air in a synchronized but unchoreographed ballet, small choices by individuals cascade across society and shift its direction, unpredictably and sometimes radically.</p>
<p>This is why there remains a case for hope, if not actual optimism, even as climate change accelerates toward climate chaos. Humans, working individually and collectively, have removed the biggest technological barriers to stopping the rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the policy and economic barriers continue to crumble too, especially when it comes to replacing fossil fuels with wind and solar. As a result, our power supply will continue to get cleaner even in states that prefer their air polluted.</p>
<p>Government must still do much more, and many technical challenges still need to be worked out. For the first time, though, a decarbonizing grid finally gives ordinary people a role in determining the continued habitability of our planet, through individual actions that collectively push society in a new direction.</p>
<p>We’ve done this before. Consider the anti-littering campaign of the 1960s that made a once-commonplace behavior unthinkable for millions of Americans. Or take the public response to the ozone hole crisis of the 1970s, when scientists discovered that the chemical aerosols emitted by spray cans were migrating up to the stratosphere and reacting with sunlight to eat away at the Earth’s protective <a href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/ozone-layer" target="_blank">ozone layer</a>. While the federal government dithered, <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/david-doniger/we-saved-ozone-layer-we-can-save-climate" target="_blank">consumers acted</a>. They abandoned aerosols in favor of pump bottles for cleaning products, roll-on deodorants and sprays reformulated to remove the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) causing the problem. The public response led to government action, culminating in the 1987 Montreal Protocol phasing out CFCs worldwide.</p>
<p>Individual choices change history when people recognize the need to alter their behavior, but only if they have acceptable alternatives that others can copy easily. Once it becomes commonplace, the planet-friendly choice can even feel like the only morally acceptable option. Individuals and even companies want to avoid the stain of public opprobrium — the reason so many corporations today have adopted sustainability goals.</p>
<p>Many threats are too great to leave to voluntary action, or too hard for enough people to understand or act on individually. We needed top-down policies to decarbonize the electric sector; voluntary investments in rooftop solar alone could never do it. We will always need government agencies like the EPA and the Food and Drug Administration to regulate toxins and dangerous products. Simply trying to empower consumers can backfire, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-07-23/prop-65-product-warnings" target="_blank">as Californians found</a> when a right-to-know law enacted by proposition led to companies labeling pretty much everything as cancer-causing, just to be on the safe side.</p>
<p>But consumer choice will be a key factor in decarbonizing buildings and transportation now that renewable energy is taking over the electric grid. As people learn about the dangers of using natural gas indoors, they will opt instead for high-efficiency heat pumps and electric induction stoves, and builders will respond to changing demand by no longer connecting homes to gas lines. The new Inflation Reduction Act, with its <a href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/app/ira-calculator" target="_blank">generous rebates</a> for home electrification, sped up the timeline for the demise of gas, but consumer preference will be the deciding factor.</p>
<p>Similarly, the IRA’s rebates for electric vehicle purchases will make consumers the killers of Big Oil. The transportation sector makes up the biggest slice of U.S. carbon emissions, and most of that is attributable to personal automobiles. Getting people out of their cars and on to bicycles or mass transit has been frustratingly hard because most of our communities were built around the automobile. The arrival of electric vehicles finally offers such an attractive alternative to the gas guzzler that it’s just a question of when, not if, the internal combustion engine goes the way of the horse-drawn buggy.</p>
<p>The battery technology that makes electric vehicles possible also allows every gasoline-powered tool to be electrified, including lawn mowers, weed-whackers and leaf blowers. Gasoline-powered lawn equipment is <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-pick-a-lawnmower/" target="_blank">astoundingly polluting</a>, in terms of both carbon emissions and smog-creating volatile organic compounds. It’s also so noisy that neighbors will pressure neighbors to switch to electric as the technology gets better and cheaper. California, Washington, D.C. and many localities have <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gas-powered-lawnmowers-california-environment-pollution/" target="_blank">banned</a> gas-powered leaf blowers, but consumer preference alone should eventually eliminate the market for them.</p>
<p>Consumer choice could also lower carbon emissions in sectors of the economy that are famously difficult to electrify. Within a few years you may be able to fly on a <a href="https://newatlas.com/aircraft/airbus-a380-biofuel-first-flight/" target="_blank">plane using biofuel</a> or live in a building made with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-a-warming-planet/the-promise-of-carbon-neutral-steel" target="_blank">low-emission steel</a> and <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2021/06/15/carbon-capturing-concrete-carbicrete/" target="_blank">concrete that sequesters carbon</a>. As we’ve seen with other technologies, though, mass adoption depends on these alternatives being cheaper, better-performing or both. That will take time.</p>
<p>Eating a plant-based diet stands out as the individual action with the greatest climate impact, according to the climate solutions handbook <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions" target="_blank"><em>Drawdown</em></a>. People are beginning to catch on to the meat industry’s <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/food-and-farms/3-smart-ways-the-us-can-grow-more-food-while-emitting-less-carbon?utm_campaign=canary&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=222213043&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_CUBvm-1DNDUfL1kFcfr7o1v1_t50DoCWnvpCFa7mhMeAXPk4pA-JWl7urxp4diyOvG4xoDdAoCug8Z1lraka22vNyo_CGSCvXUs-Ebq5WUQCjpQA&amp;utm_source=newsletter" target="_blank">outsized impact</a> on climate change, but it’s the second condition — people having alternatives they really like — that keeps the meat industry in business. Veganism is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/oct/10/from-fringe-to-mainstream-how-millions-got-a-taste-for-going-vegan" target="_blank">on the rise</a> (led, of all people, by <a href="https://www.espn.com/blog/tennessee-titans/post/_/id/26419/vegan-meals-all-the-rage-for-titans-with-15-players-converted" target="_blank">athletes</a>), but meat consumption <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/26/1023636/sustainable-meat-livestock-production-climate-change/" target="_blank">continues to grow</a> too.</p>
<p>If some <a href="https://www.rethinkx.com/press-release/2019/9/16/new-report-major-disruption-in-food-and-agriculture-in-next-decade" target="_blank">visionary thinkers</a> are right, in a few years we will all happily be eating lab-grown meat and healthy plant-based meat substitutes because they will outcompete animal products on price, taste and convenience. Removing animals from our food supply will have cascading beneficial effects as it frees up land now used to grow animal feed for more planet-friendly uses such as carbon-sequestering forests and wildlife habitat.</p>
<p>For now, as anyone who has tried to stick to a diet can tell you, knowing what you ought to do is the easy part. Getting all of humanity to adopt a carbon diet is the challenge of our time. If we’re lucky and make the right choices, we may still have time to redirect the human murmuration toward a sustainable economy.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p>On Sunday the U.S. Senate passed the historic climate legislation package hammered out between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin. The House is expected to follow suit this week, giving President Joe Biden a huge win on one of his administration’s priorities and finally making good on his pledge to tackle climate change.</p>
<p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3591223-read-full-text-senate-climate-tax-bill-grows-to-755-pages-passes-key-cbo-test/" target="_blank">The bill</a> is titled the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), apparently because the senators think inflation is the only thing most Americans care about right now. But whether it reduces inflation is beside the point. The IRA marks the federal government’s most significant investment in clean energy and transportation ever. Its $370 billion of climate spending will cut U.S. emissions <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/28625550.73511/aHR0cHM6Ly9yZXBlYXRwcm9qZWN0Lm9yZy9kb2NzL1JFUEVBVF9JUkFfUHJlbG1pbmFyeV9SZXBvcnRfMjAyMi0wOC0wNC5wZGY/5ee387318e0cb644b21dae19Bf48029dc/email" target="_blank">roughly 42% below 2005 levels</a> by 2030, only slightly less than the reductions that would have been achieved through Biden’s signature Build Back Better bill.</p>
<p>This is a huge piece of legislation, though, and some of the compromises Schumer was forced to make are not climate-friendly. Manchin, after all, is a coal baron representing a state so dominated by the extraction industries that it has lost sight of any other future. Climate hawks have to hold their noses (beaks?) to accept some noxious provisions, such as the bill’s requirement for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/allanmarks/2022/08/03/inflation-reduction-act-faustian-bargain-could-jeopardize-offshore-wind-renewable-energy-on-federal-lands/?sh=2a1fc0457089" target="_blank">new offshore drilling lease sales</a>. No doubt that one will cheer motorists who wrongly assume the government could lower gasoline prices just by turning on a spigot, if only it wanted to.</p>
<p>The bill also comes with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fossil-fuel-side-deal-us-climate-bill-slammed-by-green-groups-2022-08-02/?utm_campaign=Daily+Briefing&amp;utm_content=20220803&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue+newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank">a side deal</a> meant to ensure completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, which starts in Manchin’s home state. That news promptly <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/02/federal-climate-deal-could-force-completion-of-mountain-valley-pipeline/?utm_medium=email" target="_blank">soured many activists</a> in Virginia on the whole package.</p>
<p>Hang in there, people. The pipeline deal isn’t actually part of the IRA, and Manchin knows better than anyone that a promise of some second bill to be voted on in the future is a castle in the air. Maybe he’ll get it, maybe he won’t. Meanwhile, the IRA’s incentives for renewable energy, energy storage, energy efficiency, building electrification and electric vehicles are <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/03082022/climate-legislation-incentives-renewables-manchin/?utm_medium=email" target="_blank">overwhelmingly more impactful</a> than provisions designed to increase oil and gas production. The business case for new pipelines will only get worse.</p>
<p>Three recurring themes stand out in the IRA. One is the attention paid to ensuring benefits flow to low- and moderate-income residents and communities impacted by fossil fuel extraction. A second is the effort to incentivize manufacturing and supply chain companies to bring operations back to the U.S., using tax credits for manufacturing and requirements for U.S.-made components. The third is job creation and training for career jobs that pay well. The combined effect is that the law will benefit former coal workers in Southwest Virginia looking for employment at least as much as Northern Virginia suburbanites jonesing for Teslas.</p>

<p>Every state will see clean energy investments soar if the bill becomes law, but Virginia is especially well positioned. Though we have embarrassingly little wind and solar in our energy mix today, we have huge potential for both, a strong tech sector and a well-educated workforce.</p>
<p>Just as important, laws passed by the General Assembly in the past few years already provide the framework for our energy transition. Among them, the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1526" target="_blank">Virginia Clean Economy Act</a> and participation in the <a href="https://www.rggi.org/" target="_blank">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a> are pushing our utilities to decarbonize, including through investments in energy efficiency, solar and offshore wind. <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB572" target="_blank">Solar Freedom</a> removed barriers to private investments in distributed solar, while the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?181+sum+SB966" target="_blank">Grid Modernization Act</a> authorized upgrades to the distribution grid, and the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB1965" target="_blank">Clean Cars Act</a> started us down the road to vehicle electrification. For all of these, the IRA’s incentives make compliance easier and less expensive for both utilities and customers.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Renewable energy tax credits with an emphasis on equity and jobs</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The IRA is a big bill with a lot of <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/inflation-reduction-act-implications-4613438/" target="_blank">fine print</a> detailing incentives for a wide range of technologies, mostly clean but with a few clunkers. (Hydrogen <a href="https://www.kirkland.com/publications/kirkland-alert/2022/08/schumer-manchin-inflation-reduction-act-climate-investment" target="_blank">made from fracked gas</a>, anyone?) Still, the largest share of the renewable energy tax credits will go to companies involved in the wind and solar industries. The credits will remain fixed for 10 years before ramping down, finally providing the business certainty and long planning window that clean tech companies have been begging for.</p>
<p>The more utilities take advantage of the law to install renewable energy, the greater the benefit to electricity customers. Renewable energy <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/19/your-electric-bills-are-skyrocketing-blame-our-failure-to-invest-in-renewable-energy/" target="_blank">helps stabilize electricity costs</a>, dampening the impact of high fossil fuel prices. The IRA’s tax credits will lower the cost of building wind and solar, saving money for Virginia customers as our utilities meet and exceed the VCEA’s targets for solar, storage and wind. (So, yes, the Inflation Reduction Act will live up to its name when it comes to electricity prices.)</p>
<p>For utility-scale projects like solar farms and offshore wind, obtaining the maximum tax credit requires that a steadily increasing percentage of the equipment used be American made. Credits available to manufacturers are intended to draw the supply chain back to the U.S. and will help those parts be cost-competitive. New prevailing wage and apprenticeship program requirements favor union labor and middle-class incomes for careers in green energy.</p>
<p>While large renewable energy facilities will contribute most to decarbonizing the grid, the most generous incentives in the IRA are reserved for distributed generation facilities under 1,000 kilowatts AC (1,300 kW DC), a category that includes most rooftop solar. For these projects, the investment tax credit will return to 30% for the next 10 years, with adders available if the facility is located on a brownfield or in an “energy community” (10%), uses domestic content (10%) or serves low-income residents (10-20%). The credits can be combined, making it entirely possible for a solar project on low-income housing in Virginia’s coalfields, built using American-made equipment, to qualify for tax credits of up to 70% of the cost.</p>
<p>Not only that, but taxpayers will be allowed to sell the credits, so people with no tax liability can still take advantage of the discounts. This feature will make solar affordable for homeowners who don’t owe enough in federal taxes to use the tax credits themselves. It will also make it possible for installers to discount the upfront cost of a solar array by the amount of the tax credit so customers don’t have to wait months for a tax refund.</p>
<p>A final feature is that the tax credits will now also be available as direct payments to tax-exempt entities like local governments, schools and churches. Direct pay will have the biggest impact in states that don’t allow third-party power purchase agreements (PPAs), but it’s a great option anywhere.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</em></p></figure>
<p>The “adder” for brownfields will be of interest to many Virginia localities that want to find ways to safely use closed landfills and old industrial sites, while Virginia’s government has already identified brownfields as <a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/land-waste/land-remediation/brownfields/brightfields" target="_blank">a great opportunity for solar</a>.</p>
<p>But the biggest market opportunities would seem to be for solar on low-income housing and in areas impacted by fossil fuel extraction. Carrie Hearne, associate director for renewable energy and energy efficiency at Virginia’s Department of Energy, said the many federal funding programs laid out in the IRA “would provide great opportunities for energy infrastructure investments in communities that are most in need, and in turn, help to lower energy bills. These federal funds could also contribute to the commonwealth’s goal of competitive rates, reliable and responsible delivery of energy alongside rural economic development.&#8221;</p>
<p>To understand how the solar industry sees these opportunities, I called the leaders of three solar companies that develop onsite solar in low-income areas and in the coalfields: Dan Conant of West Virginia-based <a href="https://www.solarholler.com/" target="_blank">Solar Holler</a>, Tony Smith of Staunton-based <a href="https://securefutures.solar/" target="_blank">Secure Futures</a> and Ruth Amundsen of <a href="https://www.norfolksolar.org/programs" target="_blank">Norfolk Solar</a>. Not surprisingly, they all predicted stunning growth in both distributed solar and jobs as a result of the IRA.</p>
<p>Solar has made fewer inroads in Southwest Virginia than in other parts of the state, which Conant sees as an opportunity. One of the few unionized solar companies in the area, and the only one I know of focused exclusively on Appalachia, Solar Holler has been expanding into Southwest Virginia and hiring workers at a steady clip. (Disclosure: I own a tiny stake in Solar Holler.)</p>
<p>The company already uses American-made components, so Conant said coalfields residents will be able to take advantage of two of the adders to install solar on their homes and businesses at half price, with low-income residents paying even less. The IRA’s manufacturing tax credits for American solar companies will further reduce the cost of the projects.</p>
<p>Conant was especially excited about the IRA’s impact on jobs in Appalachia. He expects to ramp up hiring significantly once the IRA becomes law. It took no prodding from me for him to add, “I truly believe this bill will let us get to 100% clean energy in 15 years.”</p>
<p>Secure Futures also has projects underway in Southwest Virginia as well as elsewhere across the state. The company uses third-party PPAs to allow tax-exempt customers like schools and nonprofits to go solar with no money down, paying just for the electricity produced by the panels. Although the IRA allows these customers to get the tax benefits without a PPA, Secure Futures president Tony Smith said tax-exempt entities will still do better using PPAs to take advantage of accelerated depreciation.</p>
<p>Smith said the IRA will make an already strong solar market in Virginia even stronger, as the higher tax credits will push down prices and the transferability of the credits will make it easier to attract more investors to solar. At the same time, a provision of the VCEA requiring Dominion Energy Virginia to acquire renewable energy credits (RECs) from distributed generation facilities has created a strong market for these credits, helping to finance projects and making solar even more affordable for institutional customers that sell their solar RECs.</p>
<p>On the other side of the commonwealth, Norfolk Solar also installs solar in low-income communities, offering PPAs to both commercial customers and low-income residents in economically distressed areas that qualify for special tax treatment as Qualified Opportunity Zones. (Under Virginia law, residential PPAs are available only to low-income customers.) Amundsen pointed out that the 10-year time horizon of the tax credits is an added benefit of the IRA to both her customers and potential investors because it allows for long-range planning and multi-year projects.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy storage will stand on its own</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The VCEA established one of the most ambitious goals for energy storage development in the nation. But current federal law offers tax credits for energy storage only when it is part of a renewable energy project. The limitation has led to the proliferation of solar-plus-batteries projects around the country. It’s an ideal combination because it allows solar energy to be used when it is needed, unshackled from the time of day that it’s produced.</p>
<p>But uncoupling storage from renewable energy projects is a more efficient way to manage the grid, said Steve Donches, a Loudoun County attorney who represents battery storage companies and recently served on the Virginia Energy Storage Task Force.</p>
<figure id="attachment_32719" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_7456-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-32719" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_7456-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_7456-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_7456-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_7456-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_7456-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_7456-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/IMG_7456-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  <em>A Dominion Energy battery storage site in New Kent County. (Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</em></p></figure>
<p>“In many instances, the best location for storage supporting the grid is not where the renewables are located but rather near grid chokepoints or inside load pockets,” he said. “Moreover, site selection flexibility can often be important from a zoning permitting perspective. The new approach allows developers to be more nimble and locate where it is most useful and cost efficient.”</p>
<p>Recognizing this, the IRA provides a tax credit of up to 30% for energy storage whether or not it is part of a renewable energy facility.</p>
<p>This will make grid storage less expensive and easier for our utilities to install, and it will also benefit customers who want to put batteries in their buildings for back-up power. Amundsen noted that her customers sometimes can’t afford to include a battery at the time they install solar; the IRA will let them take the tax credit for storage even if they buy the battery later. This is especially important, she said, for resilience in low-income neighborhoods, where adding a battery to a solar-powered church or community center allows it to “island” during a power outage and provide a refuge for neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Homeowners will see huge benefits from building electrification</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>A cleaner electricity grid makes it possible to decarbonize other sectors of the economy by substituting electricity for fossil fuels in transportation and buildings; hence the climate advocates’ mantra “Electrify everything.” Yet while new electric appliances have become more energy efficient and attractive to consumers than the ones they replace, the switch comes with a price tag.</p>
<p>Under the new law, price will no longer be a barrier. The IRA offers rebates to residents to upgrade their homes with new electric technology such as heat pumps for heating and cooling (up to $8,000), electric induction stoves ($840), heat pump water heaters ($1,750) and upgrades to home electrical systems to support all the new load ($4,000). The rebates phase out for higher-income earners. Lower-income families replacing old and inefficient appliances will see the greatest energy savings as well as the highest rebates.</p>
<p>The federal rebates are a fantastic complement to existing Virginia programs for low-income energy efficiency upgrades. A major attraction of Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is the hundreds of millions of dollars it raises for low-income efficiency programs such as those devoted to upgrading multifamily housing like apartment buildings. Coordinating the state programs with the new federal rebates should be an urgent priority to ensure the broadest possible benefits to low-income Virginians.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, gas utilities had better start planning for <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/07/07/getting-gas-out-of-buildings-is-critical-for-climate-action-but-the-recipe-isnt-easy/" target="_blank">the end of their business</a>. There is no longer any reason to expand and upgrade gas distribution pipelines, because from here on in their customer base will be shrinking, not growing, resulting in <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/08/03/more-richmond-gas-investments-will-require-taxpayer-bailout/" target="_blank">stranded assets</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Electric vehicles aren’t just for the rich any more</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The IRA provides a $7,500 EV tax credit for new vehicles, including those made by manufacturers like Tesla and Toyota that had reached volume caps in previous law. <a href="https://www.insideenergyandenvironment.com/2022/07/strong-support-for-the-electric-vehicle-sector-and-domestic-supply-chain/" target="_blank">Restrictions apply</a>, including income limits, vehicle price caps and supply chain sourcing rules. The act also now adds a credit of up to $4,000 for used vehicles, making ownership possible for more people at all income levels.</p>
<p>Virginia is committed to vehicle electrification through its adoption of <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-air-board-adopts-clean-car-regulations/" target="_blank">clean cars</a> legislation in 2021 and a 2022 <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB575" target="_blank">law</a> requiring state agencies to buy electric light-duty vehicles whenever the total cost of ownership is less than it would be for a vehicle with an internal combustion engines. But further speeding up the transition to EVs will create ripple effects requiring careful planning. Electricity demand will increase and do so unevenly, requiring load management programs and upgrades to parts of the distribution grid.</p>

<p>Charging all these vehicles will also be an issue. Many would-be EV customers lack the ability to charge at home, either because they don’t own the space where they park or because their homes aren’t wired for easy installation of a charger. The problem is especially acute for people who rent apartments in buildings that lack charging stations.</p>
<p>No matter how generous the credits, people won’t buy EVs if they can’t charge them. Virginia must require multifamily buildings to include enough charging stations for all the residents who want them, ensure public charging stations are plentiful and convenient in low-income neighborhoods and improve its residential housing code to ensure new homes are wired to facilitate installation of chargers.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">For best results, lean in</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Virginia law requires each new governor to produce an <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title45.2/chapter17/section45.2-1710/" target="_blank">energy plan</a> in October of the first year in office, so Virginia’s Department of Energy is currently in the process of writing a plan that will have Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s stamp on it. The plan must be one that “identifies actions over a 10-year period consistent with the goal of the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy set forth in § <a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/45.2-1706.1/" target="_blank">45.2-1706.1</a> to achieve, no later than 2045, a net-zero carbon energy economy for all sectors, including the electricity, transportation, building, agricultural, and industrial sectors.”</p>
<p>Governor Youngkin hasn’t shown much enthusiasm for Virginia’s energy transition to date, having tried to gut the VCEA and repeal RGGI. Yet with the IRA making so many incentives available for clean energy and electric vehicles, leaning in to the energy transition now will allow the commonwealth to reap huge rewards in the form of economic development, job growth, cleaner air and lower energy bills.</p>
<p>The opportunities for Virginia are enormous; the governor should make the most of them.</p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fossil fuel prices are higher everywhere, and the effect is hitting electric bills as well as prices at the gas pump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilities that generate power from </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/hist/rngwhhdW.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural gas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/coal" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> face fuel costs two or three times as high as they were just a couple of years ago —and those costs are passed on to customers. Some utilities employ hedging strategies and long-term contracts to reduce the impact of price spikes. But as a general matter, how painful your bill increase will be is a function of how much electricity your utility generates from fossil fuels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gee, don’t you wish we had more renewable energy in Virginia? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s review the problem. Dominion Energy Virginia, our largest utility, generates most of its electricity from gas and coal, with 29 percent from nuclear and a tiny percentage from solar and biomass. Our second-largest utility, Appalachian Power, derives 85 percent of its power from coal and gas and only 15 percent from renewable energy, primarily wind and hydro. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both utilities are investing more in renewables now, but for years they lagged other states even as wind and solar became the lowest-cost sources of energy nationwide. Because the “fuel” for wind turbines and solar panels is free, those sources generate electricity at a stable price that looks even better when coal and gas prices go up. (Nuclear reactors are fueled by uranium, so they aren’t affected by the fossil fuel crunch either; even so, most of them </span><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/why-nuclear-power-is-bad-for-your-wallet-and-the-climate" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">need subsidies to compete</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the wholesale market.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As previously </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/05/10/amid-global-energy-price-spikes-dominion-customers-bills-could-rise-between-12-and-20-percent/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Mercury</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dominion </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/73d%2301!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a request</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the State Corporation Commission in May to increase the “fuel factor” portion of its customer bills, citing the higher prices. In the past year, according to Dominion, the price of the natural gas it bought has gone up 100 percent. High gas prices cause utilities to switch to coal generation when it’s cheaper, so the price of coal also rose by 92 percent. In all, the company said it incurred more than a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">billion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dollars more in fuel costs over the past year than it budgeted for a year ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia law, Dominion and APCo “pass through” the costs of fuel directly to customers. They don’t collect a profit, but they don’t have to swallow unexpected increases themselves. Customers will have to pay higher rates for as long as it takes Dominion to recoup the extra spending. The only question for the SCC is how quickly Dominion should collect the money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers in other states are also being hit by higher electricity bills, but the effect is uneven across the country. States that built more renewable energy protected their residents from fuel price increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data collected by the </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Energy Information Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that with few exceptions, states with lower electricity rates than Virginia’s have more renewable energy than we do. Since the EIA data doesn’t reflect all the planned increases due to rising coal and gas prices, the disparity will become even more pronounced over the coming year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States in the Pacific Northwest with a lot of inexpensive hydroelectric power have especially low rates, but wind and solar are the </span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-levelized-cost-of-storage-and-levelized-cost-of-hydrogen/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheapest forms of new energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The higher fossil fuel prices go, the better wind and solar look by comparison. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">States in the Great Plains have been building wind for years because it outcompetes everything else, so their rates are low and increasingly insulated from fossil fuel volatility. </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=ND" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> residents pay less per kilowatt-hour than Virginians do, and the state gets a whopping 83 percent of its electricity from renewable energy, primarily wind. Even </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=ND" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a deep red state wedded to fossil fuels, gets more than </span><a href="https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/North-Dakota_clean_energy_factsheet.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">35 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of its electricity from wind and another 5 percent from hydro. Its rates are already much lower than Virginia’s, and its renewable energy will cushion fuel cost increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investments in solar are also paying off. Take Utah for example, where residential rates are also far lower than Virginia’s. Utah has a coal problem, with 61 percent of its electricity from that one dirty source, and another 24 percent from natural gas. But, as </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=UT" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EIA reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “almost all the rest of in-state generation came from renewable energy, primarily solar power.” Moreover, “solar energy powers about 93 percent of Utah&#8217;s electric generating capacity added since 2015.” Evidently, Utah spent the past seven years working to future-proof its energy supply, while Dominion kept building more gas plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s slow start on the transition to renewable energy is the direct result of poor investment decisions by our utilities and a disgraceful myopia on the part of the State Corporation Commission. Environmental advocates pointed out for years that our over-commitment to fracked gas meant </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2015/04/12/dominions-natural-gas-gamble-looks-risky-for-ratepayers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’ve been gambling on fuel costs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and undervaluing price stability. But the SCC kept approving new fossil fuel projects, and actually urged Dominion to build more gas plants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, our situation would be even worse if the General Assembly had not passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act in 2020. The VCEA requires our utilities to transition to carbon-free electricity by 2050 and establishes wind and solar targets for Dominion and APCo to achieve by 2035. The targets are still too low to meet the climate emergency — but until the VCEA became law, Dominion was planning to build </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2018/05/03/for-dominion-the-answer-to-every-problem-is-more-gas/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even more gas plants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now customers have to pay for Dominion’s folly. Dominion’s filing states that if it recovers the entire $1 billion shortfall over the coming year, residential bills would have to go up by 19.8 percent. Dominion instead proposes to spread the higher charges over three years to ease the shock, making the bill increase 12.2 percent.  The effect would be further moderated this year by other adjustments the company proposes, like moving the costs of participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative into base rates, where they can be absorbed because those rates are so inflated. (On the other hand, the SCC </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7fs_01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just granted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dominion a separate rate increase for spending to extend the life of its aging nuclear plants—an undertaking projected to cost nearly $4 billion.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An SCC hearing examiner heard testimony in Dominion’s rate case on July 6 and 7. A ruling is expected later this summer, and the SCC seems likely to approve the three-year plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spreading the cost of higher fuel prices out over a longer time may reduce the rate shock, but there are drawbacks to this approach. First, Dominion will charge customers the financing costs of deferring collection on the full amount, adding to the total cost burden. (What, did you think the company was offering to absorb that cost itself?) The way it works is that ratepayers will borrow money to pay off our debt to Dominion, then repay the loan with interest over the next three years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second problem is that if the high cost of fossil fuel isn’t temporary, extending the recovery period will lead to even greater shocks in coming years. If prices stay high and we keep kicking the can down the road, we will pay more financing costs and pile up more debt. Where does this end?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not mere speculation. Dominion’s filing already projects that “fuel costs will remain elevated over the next year,” and </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/7cj_01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expert witness testimony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the case notes that Dominion revised its natural gas price projections upwards after it filed its request, without updating the amount it is seeking to collect to reflect the higher projections. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_9672" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/POWER_PLANT_GettyImages-495604852.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-9672" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/POWER_PLANT_GettyImages-495604852.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/POWER_PLANT_GettyImages-495604852.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/POWER_PLANT_GettyImages-495604852-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/POWER_PLANT_GettyImages-495604852-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/POWER_PLANT_GettyImages-495604852-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/POWER_PLANT_GettyImages-495604852-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/POWER_PLANT_GettyImages-495604852-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/POWER_PLANT_GettyImages-495604852-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A natural gas -fired power plant.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over at Appalachian Power the situation may not be any better. APCo typically seeks its fuel factor rate increases in September of each year. Last year the utility </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/5m9001!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sought a $3 average increase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in residential bills to cover higher fuel costs, at a time when coal and gas prices were still well below this year’s prices. When the company files for its next fuel factor increase two months from now, the rate increase it seeks is likely to pack a much bigger punch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What of other Virginia utilities? Our smallest publicly-owned utility, Kentucky Utilities (Old Dominion Power, which serves fiveg counties in southwest Virginia), is also heavily dependent on fossil fuels although </span><a href="https://wfpl.org/louisville-gas-and-electric-and-kentucky-utilities-asking-for-renewable-energy-proposals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">now planning to build more renewables</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. ODP filed for a modest rate increase in February of this year, just before Russia invaded Ukraine and sent world natural gas prices to heights not seen since the start of the fracking revolution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Whelan, vice president for communications and corporate responsibility, told me ODP is able to dampen the effect of fuel price volatility through a “flexible fuel procurement strategy that includes long-term contracts to help hedge against price swings as well as the ability to purchase fuel on the spot market when prices drop.” Still, ODP will have to seek another increase next February unless prices suddenly plummet. The utility recovers excess fuel costs (or lowers rates if fuel costs fall) on an annual basis, so customers would pay off the full amount over 12 months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric cooperatives that buy electricity from Old Dominion Electric Cooperative also face price increases due to high fossil fuel prices and a paucity of renewables. ODEC’s </span><a href="https://www.odec.com/wp-content/uploads/ODEC-4987_fastfacts-update2022_RD8-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 energy profile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows it generates 38 percent of its electricity from gas, 14 percent from nuclear, and 4 percent from coal. It purchases the rest from the wholesale market (38 percent) and from renewable energy projects (6 percent). Electricity sold on the PJM wholesale market is generated mainly by natural gas, nuclear and coal, so wholesale market prices are also higher now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Kirk Johnson, ODEC’s senior vice president for member engagement, ODEC has had to raise energy prices twice since the beginning of the year, effective May 1 and July 1. Assuming individual distribution cooperatives passed those costs through immediately, residential co-op customers will have seen a 16 percent increase in their electricity rates since Jan. 1. That’s a really steep increase, but Johnson notes ODEC will collect the full amount of the excess cost by Jan. 1, 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ODEC’s increase for six months is almost four percentage points lower than the increase Dominion would impose for 12 months if it were to collect its full $1 billion in the shortest time possible. Johnson said ODEC engages in a hedging strategy that acts like an insurance policy to limit the effect of fuel price volatility, and that this strategy has saved their ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So hedging and long-term contracts can smooth out fossil fuel volatility, but rates are going up everywhere in Virginia. The lesson is clear enough: “cheap” fracked gas was a bad bargain. Our utilities should have been building wind and solar over the last several years to protect us from fossil fuel price volatility, rather than waiting for the General Assembly to force them to act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, the more we invest in wind and solar, the more price stability we will have in our electricity rates, and the less we will have to worry about high fossil fuel prices in the future.  </span></p>
<p><em>This story has been updated to note that 24 percent of Utah&#8217;s electricity is drawn from natural gas.</em></p>

I took this strategy with me to college, commandeering the tiny kitchenette tucked into the hallway of my coed dorm. The aroma of chocolate chip cookies hot out of the oven reliably drew a crowd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One fan was so enthusiastic that he wanted to learn to make cookies himself. So the next time, he showed up at the start of the process. He watched me combine sugar and butter, eggs and flour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of being appreciative, he was appalled. It had never occurred to him that anything as terrific as a cookie could be made of stuff so unhealthy. It’s not that he thought they were created from sunshine and elf magic; he just hadn’t thought about it at all. He left before the cookies even came out of the oven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt so bad about it, I ate the whole batch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cookies are practically health food compared to other things we consume without really understanding the dangers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not just food. </span>Plastic packaging, chemical additives, <a href="https://peer.org/areas-of-work/public-health/pfas/" target="_blank">PFAS</a>, <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/assets/docs/j_q/phthalates_the_everywhere_chemical_handout_508.pdf" target="_blank">phthalates</a> and numerous other chemicals enter our homes and bodies without our conscious acquiescence, causing havoc for ourselves, our children and the rest of life on earth. It’s hard to know the risks, harder still to avoid them. So maybe you carry reusable bags and water bottles, buy organic if you can, and otherwise, try not to think too hard about it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where ignorance is bliss—or at any rate, a state of mind sufficient to keep you from a complete mental breakdown — you could be excused for feeling ‘tis folly to be wise. Why not just eat the cookies?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, because sometimes reading the ingredients can make a difference. Public pressure has been the major driver of government action on climate, particularly in decarbonizing the electric sector. People saw the recipe for their power supply and recoiled at all that fossil fuel. Short of installing solar panels on their rooftops, individuals in most states have little control over their source of electricity. It was a collective outcry that led to </span><a href="https://www.cesa.org/projects/100-clean-energy-collaborative/guide/table-of-100-clean-energy-states/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">nearly half of all states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> setting carbon-free electricity targets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems odd, then, that we have not seen the same outcry when it comes to fossil fuel use in buildings, including natural gas in homes. As our electricity gets cleaner, buildings must become all-electric on the way to a fully decarbonized energy economy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turns out, that’s a tall order. About 48 percent of American homes use natural gas for heating, and many also have gas appliances like stoves and hot water heaters. Starting in 2019, a few cities started banning new gas connections in an effort to speed the transition to all-electric homes. But in response, the gas industry </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/17/politics/natural-gas-ban-preemptive-laws-gop-climate/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">persuaded legislatures in 20 states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to prohibit localities from enacting such bans. (An industry effort to “ban the bans” </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/04/21/what-new-virginia-laws-reveal-about-how-the-natural-gas-industry-sees-its-future/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> failed mainly because no localities have tried to go that route.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now at least, the industry seems to have public sentiment on its side. Natural gas is truly the chocolate-chip cookie of fossil fuels: it heats the air reliably, chefs love it and it’s lower in calories—I mean, carbon—than coal. Even the name sounds benign. What can be wrong with something “natural?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Disillusionment sets in only when you read the recipe. (“First, frack one well&#8230;”) Understanding the harmfulness of the ingredients is the key to getting people to insist on all-electric homes and businesses. The primary component of natural gas is methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than CO2. Methane leaking from wellheads, pipelines, compressor stations and storage facilities </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/22613532/climate-change-methane-emissions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">contributes alarmingly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to climate change. Older cities are </span><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/major-us-cities-are-leaking-methane-twice-rate-previously-believed" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">riddled with leaking distribution pipelines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> running through neighborhoods, </span><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/05/220512164115.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">especially those housing low-income and non-White residents</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Occasionally, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-massachusetts-explosions/dozens-of-gas-blasts-rock-boston-suburbs-killing-at-least-one-injuring-12-idUSKCN1LT3E5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">they explode.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Those beloved gas stoves leak methane </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/27/1075874473/gas-stoves-climate-change-leak-methane" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">even when turned off</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, and burning gas in buildings causes high levels of indoor air pollution. Cooking with gas releases respiratory irritants, including nitrogen dioxide, ultrafine particulate matter (PM 2.5), carbon monoxide and formaldehyde. The effect is </span><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/12/gas-stoves-hazardous-asthma.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">particularly harmful to children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, with studies showing children living in homes with gas stoves are 42 percent more likely to suffer from symptoms of asthma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It used to be that gas outperformed electricity in buildings, but no longer. Recent advances in technology mean electric heat pumps provide heating and air conditioning efficiently and effectively </span><a href="https://rmi.org/heat-pumps-a-practical-solution-for-cold-climates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">even in very cold climates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Every gas appliance has an electric counterpart. Even for cooking, gas has met its match in electric induction stoves, which have been </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/11/dining/induction-cooking.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">winning over chefs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> nationwide. In a few years, we will wonder why we ever allowed open flames in our kitchens.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cost and convenience also favor all-electric buildings. An electric heat pump instead of both a gas burner and electric air conditioning means only one system to maintain and one utility bill instead of two. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The question isn’t why homeowners would give up gas, but why builders still include it. Clearly, no one is reading the recipe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With so much gas infrastructure already in place, and so little public awareness of the dangers, getting the gas out of buildings will be a slow process. In Virginia, gas companies continue to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/12/03/gas-pipeline-upgrades-planned-to-increase-capacity-to-hampton-roads/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">propose pipeline projects</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that would actually increase supply, in the hopes of locking in new customers. This is, to use the technical term, nuts. Those pipelines will have to be abandoned within a couple of decades, not “just” because the climate crisis demands it, but because consumers won’t keep buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, it will take time for most people to grasp how harmful methane is and how superior the alternative is. Once consumers begin insisting on all-electric buildings, however, gas utilities will enter a death spiral as they are forced to raise prices for remaining customers, who will then switch to electricity, too. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that point, electrification of the building sector will be complete, and we will begin to close the cookbook on gas.</span></p>

(VCU Capital News Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dominion Energy never used to be happy about customers producing their own energy from solar. “Hostile” is more the word that springs to mind. The company has traditionally seen privately owned solar arrays as competition: The more solar panels people put on their roofs, the less electricity they buy from their utility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Virginia has long allowed net metering, and in 2020 our General Assembly came down firmly on the side of customers by expanding opportunities for onsite solar. Consumers responded with the enthusiasm legislators hoped for. </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/Virginia%20Solar-Factsheet-2022-Q2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Industry statistics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> show annual residential solar installations in the commonwealth roughly tripled from 2019 to today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. Virginia homeowners and businesses in the market for a solar array can now buy it from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Energy called BrightSuite. The BrightSuite </span><a href="https://brightsuite.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> touts some of the same customer benefits that solar advocates have been pointing out all these years: consumer savings, carbon reductions, stable electric bills. And why shouldn’t Dominion sell solar? As the website declares, “We embrace change with a commitment first and foremost to meet our customers’ evolving energy needs.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, amen to that! With climate chaos impacting people’s lives and high fossil fuel prices driving up utility bills faster than the rate of inflation, customers’ energy needs certainly have evolved, and they do now include onsite solar arrays. We just didn’t expect to hear that from Dominion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that’s okay, we welcome latecomers! Moreover, while Dominion’s entry into the residential market will make some people uneasy, it could goose demand, growing the distributed solar market for everyone while pushing out the price-gougers.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, though, let’s address that unease. Having an affiliate of the local utility compete for a homeowner’s business puts independent installers at a definite disadvantage. Dominion has a much broader marketing reach, and BrightSuite’s use of the Dominion name carries an implied promise of trustworthiness. In a market crowded with competitors, name recognition and the assurance that a company isn’t going away any time soon are distinct advantages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Dominion’s entry into the retail solar business could ultimately be good for independent installers. Dominion doesn’t do anything inexpensively, and its home solar offering appears to be no exception. If Dominion persuades more customers to look into home solar, and those customers then comparison shop, companies that can offer a better deal will get more business.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sarah Vogelsong recently </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/05/25/as-residential-solar-grows-more-popular-advocates-worry-about-consumer-protections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> about a project of the </span><a href="https://www.hrclimatehub.org/solar/solar-installer-comparison/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">HR Climate Hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, which solicited quotes from solar installers for the same single-family home in order to compare prices and service, and to flag potentially predatory sellers. The website offers helpful advice to Virginia homeowners about how solicit and compare offers. It also lists prices and terms from a dozen companies, ranging from a low of $2.10 per watt from Tesla to a high of $5.62 from Power Home Solar. Two small, well-regarded Virginia Beach installers submitted bids of $2.80 and $2.85. BrightSuite’s quote (added after the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Mercury</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> article ran) came in at $3.25. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">HR Climate Hub’s figures square with information from the Solar Energy Industries Association, which provides advice for consumers and tracks the average cost of residential solar systems through a service called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">SolarReviews</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. According to the </span><a href="https://www.solarreviews.com/solar-panel-cost/virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, “As of Jun 2022, the average cost of solar panels in Virginia is $2.66 per watt making a typical 6000 watt (6 kW) solar system $11,797 after claiming the 26% federal solar tax credit now available.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked HR Climate Hub for additional information about the BrightSuite quote and was glad to learn the company uses high quality REC solar panels that carry a 25-year warranty, along with microinverters made by Enphase, a top-quality American company. So, no bottom shelf components here. However, the quote did not mention warranty or maintenance information for the installation work. These do not appear on the BrightSuite website either, apart from a one-year performance guarantee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It goes without saying that anyone investing thousands of dollars on a major home improvement should shop around, compare prices, and read warrantees. Prices listed on HR Climate Hub and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">SolarReviews</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> are a good starting point. Where available, bulk purchase programs like those offered by </span><a href="https://solarizenova.org/pricing" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Solarize NoVa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://www.solarunitedneighbors.org/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Virginia Solar United Neighbors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> provide discounts as well as expert advice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it wouldn’t be surprising if even well-informed consumers choose to pay a premium to get a solar installation from BrightSuite simply because the company is associated with their utility. Name recognition goes a long way in marketing, and a lot of customers will want the security of knowing Dominion Energy isn’t likely to take the money and disappear into the night. With this marketing advantage, I expect BrightSuite will quickly emerge as a market leader in spite of its higher-than-average price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ultimately, however, Dominion’s entry into the market may grow the pie for everyone. Homeowners who have held back from installing solar because they don’t know who to trust may feel confident enough to call BrightSuite. Once they have one quote, many will comparison shop.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very least, Dominion’s entry into the home solar market should set a price ceiling. Why would anyone pay $5 per watt or more for a solar array from a company they probably don’t know anything about, when they could get $3.25 from their utility? Price gougers, beware: your time here is up.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most people are aware by now that inflation has hit the energy sector hard, with fossil fuels in particular skyrocketing in price over the past year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dominion Energy Virginia, the state’s dominant utility, says it needs to charge residential customers </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/getattachment/7027c80d-a9dd-412a-b446-6efae4f5302c/nr220064.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">an extra $14.93 per month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on average to cover higher natural gas prices. Appalachian Power, which serves Southwest Virginia as well as West Virginia, has already asked the West Virginia Public Service Commission for permission to increase residential bills by </span><a href="https://wchstv.com/news/local/appalachian-power-seeks-rate-hike-that-would-boost-average-monthly-residential-bill-1841" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">an average of $18.41</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to cover higher coal and gas prices, and is likely to seek a similar increase from Virginia customers this summer.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for residents of Southwest Virginia, that could be just the beginning of the rate increases: West Virginia wants to force APCo customers to pay even more, and <a href="https://www.wvpublic.org/energy-environment/2022-06-06/psc-to-hold-4-public-hearings-on-appalachian-powers-rate-request" target="_blank">not just in West Virginia</a>. If the West Virginia PSC has its way, Virginia customers would have to shoulder their “share” of the cost of propping up two money-losing West Virginia coal plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The PSC’s </span><a href="http://www.psc.state.wv.us/scripts/WebDocket/ViewDocument.cfm?CaseActivityID=583871" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of May 13 reiterates previous instructions to APCo to keep its West Virginia coal plants running at least 69 percent of the time, even when the plants lose money. This decision comes on top of a decision in October of 2021 allowing APCo to charge customers for hundreds of millions of dollars in costs to prolong the life of these coal plants </span><a href="https://www.powermag.com/west-virginia-psc-approves-continued-operation-of-three-aep-coal-power-plants-through-2040/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">out to 2040</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. An expert hired by the Sierra Club </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/54l201!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> it would cost up to $1.1 billion more to keep the plants operating until 2040 instead of retiring them in 2028. </span></p>
<p>https://www.wvpublic.org/energy-environment/2022-06-06/psc-to-hold-4-public-hearings-on-appalachian-powers-rate-request</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For Virginia customers, the problem is that these West Virginia coal plants, Amos and Mountaineer, also provide electricity to Southwest Virginia, so Southwest Virginia residents have to pay for them. Even before the fuel price spikes of the past year and a half, APCo wanted to charge its Virginia customers for the upgrades approved by the West Virginia PSC. The company will certainly also want Virginians to pay for the even higher costs that will follow from the 69 percent run requirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Virginia’s State Corporation Commission has so far held off on approving the millions of dollars that would be Virginia’s share of the costs to upgrade Amos and Mountaineer. But with the West Virginia PSC plowing ahead to support its state’s favored industry, it’s not at all clear the SCC will stand its ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">APCo’s study claims that closing Amos and Mountaineer will cost ratepayers more than keeping them open, ensuring there will be a battle of the experts come the September hearing. The study is opaque in its methodology and reasoning. But APCo almost certainly didn’t assume the plants would have to run 69 percent of the time regardless of market conditions, and it probably also didn’t factor in today’s sky-high fossil fuel costs that further support retiring the coal plants and investing in cheaper, price-stable wind and solar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Obviously, the biggest losers here are West Virginia residents. They will bear the largest share of these costs, one more price of living in a state run by fossil fuel oligarchs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an alternate universe, West Virginia would have developed an economy that took advantage of its extraordinary natural beauty, one based on small farms, four-season tourism, artist enclaves and vacation homes: think Vermont but with better weather. Instead, fossil fuel and mining barons bought up mineral rights, paid off politicians, and despoiled vast swaths of the state, leaving most residents dependent on dirty jobs or piecing together a living from low-wage work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m rooting for West Virginia to change course for a post-coal world, but that’s not easy for a state where politicians, bureaucrats and industry conspire to maintain the power of extraction industries. Virginians, however, shouldn’t be forced to enable this misuse of power. The SCC should reject West Virginia’s effort to make Virginia customers pay to prop up West Virginia coal.</span></p>

(Dominion Energy)</p><p>Well, that didn’t take long.</p>
<p>A few weeks after I wrote about rising natural gas prices, Dominion Energy Virginia asked the SCC for permission to raise the price of electricity by about $9 per month for the average residential customers, citing higher fuel costs. Virginia law allows utilities to pass through its fuel costs to customers, without a profit margin, making it unlikely the SCC will turn down the request. Natural gas is Dominion’s largest fuel source, so its electricity rates are highly vulnerable to price swings in the market for fracked gas.</p>
<p>That makes this a really peculiar time for Dominion to launch a new solar energy purchase option that will add about $20 per month on average for customers who elect to meet their entire electricity demand with solar, without exempting them from the coming bill increase due to higher gas prices. If the company were trying to discourage people from signing up for its solar product, it could hardly have chosen a better time. The fact that the company delayed the launch of this program for more than three years, only to offer it now, makes it all the more suspect.</p>
<p>Dominion’s solar option, confusingly called “Community Solar,” is the product of legislation passed in 2017, three years before the General Assembly authorized private solar developers to sell to Virginia customers. The 2020 legislation dubbed the private program “shared solar,” and it remains mired in SCC rulemaking.</p>
<p>But Dominion Community Solar is different. As I wrote back in 2018, when the SCC approved the program (and its launch seemed imminent), this program is really a solar tariff. Dominion generates electricity from solar and puts it on the grid, and customers who want to run their homes and businesses on solar pay extra on their bill.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, participants also get the renewable energy certificates (RECs) associated with the solar energy. That prevents Dominion from selling the RECs to anyone else or using them to show compliance with Virginia’s new renewable portfolio standard (RPS). This is important to avoid double-counting and ensure that solar paid for by the voluntary market is in addition to the solar developed to serve customers under the RPS.</p>
<p>The $20 premium for the program will sound unreasonably high to people who have experience with community solar in other states, where it is typically offered at a discount to regular grid power. In many states, private developers build the solar facilities and sell the output to participants. The rate is typically fixed for many years, because solar has low O&amp;M costs and uses no fuel. Customers still pay their utility for transmission and distribution, but the community solar fee replaces utility-delivered generation rates. Accordingly, participating customers are insulated from price increases due to higher natural gas (or coal) costs.</p>
<p>That is not Dominion Community Solar. Dominion’s program requires customers to pay for all the utility’s costs of running its generating plants and purchasing fuel and paying for rate adjustment clauses (RACs), including those for new renewable energy facilities that serve the entire rate base and RECs bought for the RPS. These solar-only customers will also have to pay Dominion’s costs for buying carbon allowances in the RGGI market, which the company incurs as a result of generating power from fossil fuels. (Dominion is hoping Governor Youngkin will succeed in pulling Virginia out of RGGI and has suggested shifting compliance costs from riders to base rates in the meantime, clearly as a way to mitigate the rate increase due to high gas prices.)</p>

<p>Dominion Community Solar customers will pay for all these costs of fossil fuel generation, and the cost of Dominion building renewable energy facilities for all its other customers. And then on top of all that, they will pay an extra $20 per month.</p>
<p>Let’s leave aside the question of whether $20 is even a fair premium for a solar tariff. Ultra-high gas prices, RPS riders and RGGI compliance costs are all new since the SCC authorized Dominion’s program in 2018. It’s hard to imagine the SCC agreeing today that program participants should pay all these costs in addition to the cost of developing community-sized solar arrays.</p>
<p>But something else has changed too: The shared solar legislation passed in 2020 promised customers the alternative of being able to buy solar from a third-party provider, unhooking participants from the roller-coaster ride of fossil fuel prices. As I noted before, though, shared solar is mired in proceedings at the SCC, where Dominion is seeking to<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/15/solar-groups-say-55-minimum-bill-for-shared-solar-is-unworkable/" target="_blank"> impose such high fixed costs</a> on participants as to make the program impossible to offer.</p>
<p>Right now, Dominion has an SCC hearing examiner mostly on its side.</p>
<p>If the SCC commissioners accept the hearing examiner’s recommendations, that could spell the end of shared solar—or at any rate, make Dominion’s $20 look good by comparison.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural gas is having a moment. The war in Ukraine spotlighted Europe’s heavy reliance on Russian gas and the challenge of replacing it with new supplies from elsewhere. Suddenly the Biden administration, after talking so much about the need to get off fossil fuels, wants to expand oil and gas production and boost exports of liquified natural gas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The president still intends to address the climate crisis, just not right now. The sudden shift brings to mind St. Augustine’s prayer: “Lord, make me virtuous, but not yet!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be fooled, though. In fact, natural gas is facing an existential crisis. Back when it was cheap, it wasn’t profitable; now that prices are high, U.S. consumers have better alternatives. Europeans will want to import our expensive LNG only until they have other options. Today’s tight supplies obscure the big-picture reality that the gas industry is in the fight for its life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fracking industry likes to bill its product as the cleaner and cheaper alternative to coal in generating electricity. And indeed, advances in fracking technology produced a </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/business/energy-environment/natural-gas-shale-chevron.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">years-long glut</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of gas, driving prices so low that gas </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=22312" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overtook coal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as the top fuel in U.S. power generation beginning in 2015. Gas made up </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">38.3 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of electricity in 2021 compared to coal’s 21.8 percent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But competition from ever-cheaper wind and solar have stalled the gas industry’s growth in the power sector. Today utilities are more interested in building renewable energy and battery storage than new gas plants. Natural gas was projected to make up </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46416" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only 16 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of new U.S. electricity generating capacity in 2021, compared to 39 percent for solar and 31 percent for wind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">High prices will exacerbate this trend. </span><a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/natural-gas" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natural gas prices today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are higher than at any time since 2008, having more than trebled in just the past two years. The rise began well before the war in Ukraine, and now international market demand has pushed it higher. This is good for fracking companies that </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-22/shale-s-bust-shows-basis-of-boom-debt-debt-and-debt-quicktake" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spent the last 10 years losing money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but from a utility’s perspective, price-stable renewables just look better and better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately for the gas industry, making electricity is just one use for its product. Methane remains the dominant fuel for heating buildings, with </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/use-of-natural-gas.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about half of U.S. homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and businesses using it for space heating, water heating, cooking and other appliances. It is also a feedstock for many industrial operations, including fertilizer and plastics manufacturing. Protecting the first use, and expanding the second, are critical to staving off obsolescence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That explains three pieces of legislation passed in Virginia in the past two years, all modeled on bills enacted in other states. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB1257" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which I’ll discuss in a minute, originally would have prohibited local governments from banning new gas connections within their jurisdiction, protecting the industry’s access to new retail customers. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+ful+SB565" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sets up a way for gas companies to include methane from pig waste lagoons and other non-fossil sources in their pipelines, allowing them to claim green credit — and subsidies — for marketing what they call renewable natural gas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, 2021 </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1164" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promotes “advanced recycling” of waste plastics — using a process called chemical conversion to turn plastic into other plastic or into fuel and then burning it — in part to forestall efforts to phase out single-use plastics like </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-general-assembly-agrees-to-ban-polystyrene-food-containers-by-2025/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Styrofoam food containers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and plastic bags. As a technology, chemical conversion is inelegant, being energy-intensive and </span><a href="https://vcnva.org/chemical-conversion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly polluting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a business, the economics are questionable (and the main company benefiting from the law </span><a href="https://www.farmvilleherald.com/2022/01/braven-no-longer-coming/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">canceled plans for a facility in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). But as PR, the reframing is brilliant. Why not expand plastics production forever if we can turn the waste into fuel or new plastic?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the success of the law can be seen in Gov. Glen Youngkin’s new executive order ostensibly promoting recycling while </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/04/07/youngkin-recycling-plastics-ban/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overturning a previous order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Ralph Northam that required executive agencies to give up single-use plastics by 2025. General Assembly members are also falling for the propaganda, proposing via the state budget to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/budgets-call-for-polystyrene-ban-delay-despite-2021-compromise/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">delay the ban</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on polystyrene food containers that was to have taken effect beginning next year. </span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Banning the bans: the gas industry fights building electrification</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RNG and plastics are important for the gas industry, but protecting its market share in the building sector is central to its future. Ultimately it is doomed to failure. All-electric buildings are a requirement for a fully decarbonized economy, and their health and safety advantages make a compelling case for localities that want to help meet climate targets by preventing new homes from being connected to gas lines. Some cities in solidly blue states </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/climate/gas-stoves-methane-emissions.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have banned new gas hook-ups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; elsewhere, red state legislatures are passing laws to ban the bans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public support for these bans will grow as people learn more about the hazards of using gas in their homes. Read enough stories about methane </span><a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/major-us-cities-are-leaking-methane-twice-rate-previously-believed" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from underground pipes and in homes (and </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-top-news-baltimore-explosions-u-s-news-42cb919592a81a4b02f6e2ea30831eb2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">occasionally</span></a> <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/northern-virginia/chopper4-injuries-reported-after-gas-line-catches-fire-in-northern-virginia/2561044/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exploding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and setting fire to buildings), or about the health impacts of indoor air pollution from gas heaters and </span><a href="https://rmi.org/insight/gas-stoves-pollution-health/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stoves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and you may wonder why we ever thought it a good idea to have open flames in our homes. Yet once a house is built with a gas furnace and appliances, it is much harder for a homeowner to go all-electric. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, though, no Virginia jurisdiction has sought to ban gas connections, and it’s not clear whether they could do so in a Dillon Rule state like Virginia. Right now, a law to keep them from doing so sounds a little on the hysterical side, like prohibiting people from walking tigers off-leash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the proponents of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB1257" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1257</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could cite only a much narrower threat. The City of Richmond recently committed itself to achieving </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/sustainability/what-rvagreen-2050-0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike almost any other city in Virginia, Richmond owns a gas utility that serves its residents and businesses. Sometime in the next 28 years, if the city is serious, it will have to sell the utility or shut down gas service, forcing customers to look elsewhere if they want gas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gas industry and its industrial customers used this far-off threat as a pretext for a Virginia ban-the-ban bill. In its original form, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB1257" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1257</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kilgore) declared it the right of every person to access natural gas, calling this “energy justice,” and explicitly forbidding any public entity from doing anything to interfere with this sacred right. (Oh, except that gas utilities don’t have to supply gas even to willing customers if they can’t make money doing so, and they are free to cut off service to anyone who can’t pay their bills. Justice stretches only so far as profit permits.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican-led House passed the whole bill, but the Democratic-led Senate pared it back to deal just with a locality that gets out of the gas utility business, requiring that it give three years’ notice and try to sell or auction off the utility. The final version omits the “energy justice” language that was such an inspiring tribute to George Orwell, but it solves the “immediate” problem in Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s not likely that we have seen the end of legislative efforts in Virginia to ban local restrictions on natural gas connections. The gas industry needs to lock in new customers now, because its future is looking very bleak indeed. </span></p>

The Virginia Attorney General's Office is criticizing the massive cost estimates of a larger planned wind development in the same area. (Sarah Vogelsong/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A massive wind farm 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach moved one giant step closer to reality last November when Dominion Energy </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/DocketSearch#caseDocs/142236" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind development plan with the State Corporation Commission. Dominion expects to begin construction on CVOW in 2024, and have all 2,587 megawatts of power connected to the grid in 2026.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the wind farm’s price tag of $9.8 billion, and its $87 per megawatt hour levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), is causing </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/va-ag-costs-high-benefits-uncertain-from-dominion-wind-proposal/article_cf9b5ed6-4ca6-5744-a69c-940bcf660da3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">heartburn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> over at the attorney general’s office. Scott Norwood, an expert for the Division of Consumer Counsel, </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/6%25cz01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the project on three main grounds: that the cost of building CVOW is more than building a new nuclear reactor and 2-3 times as much as building solar facilities; that Dominion has overstated the benefits of the project; and that in any event, Dominion doesn’t need the energy before at least 2035. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recognizing that the General Assembly already made most of these points moot by declaring the project to be in the public interest, however, Norwood also recommended the SCC adopt consumer safeguards including periodic status reports and cost oversight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyone familiar with Dominion’s tendency to pad profits will say “Amen” to the call for strict SCC oversight. With a project this huge, the SCC must be especially vigilant.  Some of Norwood’s criticisms, however, seem more calculated for effect, while others miss the point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Norwood certainly knows his comment that CVOW is more expensive than nuclear is not true. The price tag of the only two nuclear reactors under development in the U.S. has ballooned so high </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21012022/georgia-power-vogtle-nuclear/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">($30 billion and counting)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that it almost</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">makes Dominion’s former dream of a third nuclear reactor at North Anna look good. </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2015/08/10/dominion-admits-cost-of-north-anna-3-will-top-19-billion/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Norwood’s own devastating testimony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> likely helped kill the North Anna 3 project, which would have delivered electricity for $190 per megawatt-hour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Norwood says Dominion has fudged the CVOW numbers and the project will cost customers more than the company admits, but still, Dominion would have to gold-plate every turbine before it could touch the cost of nuclear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This wasn’t the first time the General Assembly put its thumb on the scale for a Dominion project. The habit goes back to 2008, when a Dominion coal plant, the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, became the first project legislatively deemed “in the public interest.” Even back then its projected levelized cost of electricity was $93/MWh. Today, VCHEC loses so much money for customers that Dominion </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2022/03/30/dominion-agrees-to-study-viability-of-wise-coal-plant-which-is-not-producing-much-electricity/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=466c2bd0-9e0c-40af-b739-231579ef619b" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">faces pressure at the SCC to close the plant.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For that matter, I also see that my latest electricity bill from Dominion includes a non-bypassable charge for coal ash disposal of $5.68—an amount that exceeds the charges for participation in RGGI, new solar projects and the RPS program, combined. Pollution is also a cost of using fossil fuels, but it’s never included in the LCOE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mr. Norwood did not suggest Dominion pursue new nuclear or new fossil fuel plants instead of offshore wind. If Dominion needed new generation, he says, solar is the low-cost alternative. It’s cheaper to build, and it produces electricity at a lower cost than offshore wind. He’s right: if all you cared about was LCOE, no one would build anything but solar in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But as critics are quick to note, solar can’t provide electricity 24/7. Offshore wind has a </span><a href="https://wes.copernicus.org/articles/5/1191/2020/#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">hidden superpower</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: while solar production peaks in the middle of the day, the wind off our coast can produce electricity both day and night, is often strongest in the evening when demand rises, and is stronger in the winter when solar is less productive. Solar and offshore wind are complementary, and we can’t get to a carbon-free grid without both. So yes, we need CVOW.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Virginia’s leaders are also taking the long view on cost. In any new industry, early projects are more expensive than later ones. Europe’s 30 years of experience developing an offshore wind industry shows costs fall steadily as project experience and new technology enable developers to produce more energy with fewer turbines. States up and down the East Coast are pursuing offshore wind projects not only because they want clean energy, but because they expect these early investments to lead to lower-cost power as the industry achieves scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">State leaders also see economic development and job growth as important benefits, and those aren’t reflected in LCOE either. This is another area where SCC oversight can ensure the greatest public benefit from CVOW. </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/6%25d101!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Testimony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> filed by a Sierra Club expert urges that Dominion’s economic development plan be revised with specific metrics around the VCEA’s goals for diversity, equity and inclusion in the offshore wind workforce. Like reducing pollution, creating jobs for residents from low-income and minority communities adds to CVOW’s overall value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/24/yeah-im-not-perfect-either-pass-the-clean-economy-act/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the VCEA’s overly-generous cost cap myself at the time, I agree with the AG’s office that the SCC has to keep a tight watch on expenses as Dominion moves forward with CVOW. But move forward it should, because Virginia needs offshore wind.  </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400">A Dominion Energy customer wrote me recently to ask what her condo association could do to go solar. The building’s roof can hold many more solar panels than needed to power the needs of the common area. Is it possible to sell the excess electricity to individual residents to power their units?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I get this question a lot, and in 2020, the Virginia General Assembly tried to change the answer from “no” to “yes.” As part of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+HB572" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Solar Freedom</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> legislation, the State Corporation Commission was tasked with creating a shared solar </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-585.1:12/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">program for residents of multifamily buildings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> like condominiums and apartment buildings, with orders to make the program available beginning in January 1, 2021. In other words, it ought to be available today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet I still have to tell people they can’t do it now, and may not be able to ever, unless the SCC changes course. Would-be customers will have just </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/6fnt01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">one final chance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> this month to try to save the program. On March 25, the SCC will take public testimony at an evidentiary hearing to address the seemingly simple question threatening the viability of the Multifamily Shared Solar Program. The law allows Dominion to collect an administrative fee from customers who participate in the program. How much should that be? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An administrative fee doesn’t sound like it could be enough to stall a program for more than a year, let alone deep-six it altogether. Dominion’s role in the Multifamily Shared Solar Program is limited to doing the accounting to make sure every unit gets credit for the share of the electricity the resident buys. That shouldn’t cost very much—perhaps a buck or two per month per customer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet Dominion proposes to impose an administrative fee of more than $87 per month—a charge so absurdly high that it would result in participants paying far more for electricity generated on the roof of their building than for the electricity Dominion delivers to them from elsewhere in the state. The SCC temporarily stopped the utility from implementing that fee, but it also stacked the deck to make a high fee almost inevitable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that’s a program killer. Rooftop solar is still a lot more expensive than large, offsite solar facilities, so keeping fees low is critical to making the economics work. It’s also a matter of equity. Owners of single-family homes with rooftop solar benefit from Virginia’s net metering program, which guarantees them a one-for-one credit for any surplus electricity generated. Multifamily residents deserve something similar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, the entire point of putting the Multifamily Shared Solar Program in Solar Freedom—a law otherwise focused on removing barriers to net metering—is to benefit Virginians who’ve been shut out of the solar market because they don’t own their own roofs. Renters in particular are more likely to have lower incomes than owners of single-family homes, so making the program available to them is important to the goal of reducing the energy burden on low- and moderate-income residents and ensuring that the transition to clean energy benefits people at all income levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m not just guessing about the intent behind Solar Freedom. I know the point is to offer residents of multifamily buildings an analog to net metering because I wrote most of the legislation as it was introduced, in collaboration with allies in local government and the legislators who introduced it. We wanted building owners and occupants to be able to work together to install onsite solar, free of SCC meddling and without the utility demanding a cut of the action. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_4667" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-4667" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1.jpg" alt="The State Corporation Commission" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/state-corporation-commission-1-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The State Corporation Commission regulates Virginia electric utilities. (Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But as so often happens with legislative sausage-making, the bill changed as it went through negotiations and emerged from committees. The SCC was charged with developing a formal program, and Dominion was given a role in administering it. Yet the new language made clear that the original purpose remained. The SCC is to write regulations that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“reasonably allow for the creation and financing of shared solar facilities” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> “allow all customer classes to participate in the program, and ensure participation opportunities for all customer classes.” </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The legislation provides for participants to be credited on their utility bills with their share of the electricity generated by the solar panels. The SCC is to make an annual calculation of the bill credit rate</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> “as the effective retail rate of the customer&#8217;s rate class, which shall be inclusive of all supply charges, delivery charges, demand charges, fixed charges and any applicable riders or other charges to the customer.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">To the definition of “bill credit rate” is added the admonition that the rate “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">shall be set such that the shared solar program results in robust project development and shared solar program access for all customer classes.” </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This language is consistent with a goal of putting multifamily buildings on par with single-family homes in making rooftop solar affordable. But, unlike the original legislative language, and unlike the rules of net metering, the final version of Solar Freedom instructs the SCC to “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">allow the investor-owned utilities to recover reasonable costs of administering the program.” </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that’s the opportunity Dominion wants to exploit. As soon as the SCC began the process of writing rules for the Multifamily Shared Solar Program, Dominion advanced the claim that the administrative fee should be based on essentially all of the costs of operating an electric utility. Instead of the multifamily program mirroring net metering, Dominion took as its model a larger program under a very different law. The Shared Solar legislation, also passed in 2020, creates a program for community solar facilities that can be onsite or offsite, can serve many more customers anywhere in Dominion’s territory, and can even be carved out of a utility-scale solar facility. The </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-594.3/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">shared solar law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> specifically allows Dominion to charge most customers a “minimum bill” with a list of components, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">and also</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> an “administrative fee.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Things aren’t going well for the </span><a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/DocketSearch#caseDocs/140921" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Shared Solar program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> at the SCC. A hearing examiner recently </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/6l5z01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">recommended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the commission adopt a minimum bill of more than $55, based on an </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/6df001!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">SCC staff recommendation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. It did not trouble the hearing examiner or the staff that the number puts the cost of shared solar above the cost of Dominion’s own electricity, a program killer according to community solar developers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But cramming the minimum bill elements into the multifamily program’s administrative fee would be an even greater blow to a program whose economics are already constrained by the smaller size of onsite projects. It also seems obvious from a plain reading of the two laws that the General Assembly did not intend to burden multifamily residents with the fees it authorized for the Shared Solar participants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately for customers, the SCC </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/07/15/legislators-built-a-solar-program-for-apartment-dwellers-the-scc-gutted-it/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">approved the cramming</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in concept last July, ignoring this plain legislative intent. Based on that, SCC staff </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/679301!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">proposed options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for the administrative fee of either $16.78 or $57.26, with the higher fee using the same reasoning that just led to the hearing examiner’s $55 recommendation in the shared solar program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The SCC ought to reject these numbers and instead adopt the dollar or two that running the multifamily shared solar program will actually cost Dominion. But to do so, commissioners will have to reverse their earlier, egregious decision and embrace what seems to be (for them) the novel concept that the General Assembly intended the plain meaning of its words. Only then will residents of multifamily buildings gain their solar freedom. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Note: those wishing to testify at the SCC hearing must </span></i><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/pages/Webcasting" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">sign up</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> by March 22.</span></i></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before taking office, Gov. Glenn Youngkin made two rookie mistakes: he declared his intention to pull Virginia out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative by executive order, not realizing </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/attorney-general-herring-says-youngkin-cant-take-virginia-out-of-regional-greenhouse-gas-initiative/article_5eee649c-c6c1-5886-b148-db3b49a11ed0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it can only be done by legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and he nominated the much-reviled Trump-era EPA chief Andrew Wheeler to be his secretary of natural resources, apparently unaware the appointment would need approval from the Democratic-led Senate he had just infuriated with the RGGI announcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently not a man to admit a blunder, on his first day in office Youngkin signed an  </span><a href="about:blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> directing the Department of Environmental Quality to notify RGGI of his intent to withdraw Virginia from the carbon-cutting program, and to develop an “emergency regulation” to send to the State Air Pollution Control Board for the same purpose. The language in the order is a little </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-and-regional/govt-and-politics/youngkin-backs-off-plan-to-use-executive-power-to-remove-virginia-from-rggi/article_2f276193-af84-557d-a849-4443f0cb2351.html?utm_source=Energy+News+Network+daily+email+digests&amp;utm_campaign=1a6a9a06b6-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_05_11_11_39_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_724b1f01f5-1a6a9a06b6-89284331" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less than he pledged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and yet still not legal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are unfortunate signs that Youngkin, who ran for governor as a moderate Republican, might intend to govern as a burn-the-house-down extremist when it comes to the environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s surprising to see Youngkin pursuing Trumpist energy policies, and not just because they failed so dismally when Trump tried them. As the former CEO of a multibillion-dollar private equity investment company, Youngkin is, presumably, not an idiot. He has acknowledged climate change is real and affecting Virginia, and he has access to the same polls the rest of us do that show Americans are concerned and want government action to address the crisis. Corporate America also wants action; CEOs of more than 70 of the world’s largest corporations wrote </span><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/06/supercharging-public-private-efforts-in-the-race-to-net-zero-and-climate-resilience" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last June calling on governments to adopt policies capable of capping the global rise in temperature at no more than 1.5 decrees Celsius. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation that put Virginia into RGGI will lead to a 30 percent cut in the commonwealth’s electric sector CO2 emissions by 2030. Companion legislation, the Virginia Clean Economy Act, extends the carbon cutting out to 2050, to hit zero carbon emissions from the electric sector. Youngkin complains that RGGI costs ratepayers money, but it’s not like the money raised through carbon allowance auctions disappears into the ether: it pays for coastal flood-control projects and low-income energy efficiency programs that Virginia wasn’t funding before. Maybe Youngkin intends to replace these hundreds of millions of dollars with some of the federal funding coming to Virginia through the federal infrastructure bill —you know, the legislation that Virginia’s Republican congressmen </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/how-virginia-legislators-voted-on-bidens-infrastructure-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voted against</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or maybe he doesn’t really care about the human consequences of his actions, since Virginia governors can’t run for reelection. Even last fall Youngkin was being talked about as a potential presidential candidate based on his ability to say nothing of substance for an entire campaign season. It was a good trick, but it’s a hard one to pull off twice. If Youngkin runs for president, he’ll be doing it as the guy who started his governorship by trying to torch Virginia’s climate action plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether they are fellow flame-throwers or not, General Assembly Republicans are rallying around the new governor. Two bills filed last week seek to do legally what Youngkin wanted to do by executive fiat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB532" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB532</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Sen. Richard Stuart, R-Stafford) would repeal the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act, direct DEQ to suspend the commonwealth&#8217;s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and remove provisions for using revenues from the auctions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB81" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB81</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin) would prohibit the Air Pollution Control Board from considering health, environmental, scientific, or economic factors when making regulations—an attack on both RGGI and clean car regulation, as well as on the independence and very mission of the Air Board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB118" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB118</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper) goes bigger. It repeals key features of the VCEA, including achieving zero carbon emissions by 2050; allowing the SCC to approve new fossil fuel plants only if a utility has met energy-saving goals and can prove cost-effectiveness; allowing utilities to recover costs of compliance with Virginia’s new renewable portfolio standard; and making wind, solar and offshore wind projects “in the public interest,” magic words that assure utilities they will get paid for making these investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Freitas bill might pass the House, now that Republicans hold a slim majority, but neither of these two bills should pass the Senate with Democrats in charge. Creating the framework for the energy transition was a signature success for Virginia Democrats, and it’s hard to imagine a scenario in which they will let it be taken from them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That isn’t stopping other Republicans from taking their own shots. Several bills seek to undermine the energy transition in various ways; all of them are bad policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> • </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB73" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB73</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan) eliminates language putting wind, solar and offshore wind in the public interest, undercutting the market certainty that </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/virginia-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">put Virginia into the top ranks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for solar energy in the past year and attracted a major </span><a href="https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/siemens-gamesa-to-build-offshore-wind-turbine-blade-factory-in-portsmouth/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offshore wind turbine blade manufacturing facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Portsmouth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB74" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB74</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (also Ware) would subsidize certain large industrial customers by allowing them to share in the benefits, yet exempting them from the costs, of the energy transition, shifting their share of the costs onto all other customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB5" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB5</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Del. Will Morefield, R-Tazewell,) raids the RGGI funds to get money for his own district. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB892" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB892</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Del. Terry Kilgore, R-Scott) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+SB398" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB398</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Sen. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover) subsidize RGGI costs for certain fossil fuel generators, another raid on the funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB1204" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1204</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kilgore) prevents the RPS from taking effect until 2025 and guts the carve-out for distributed generation permanently. It also removes the authority of the State Air Pollution Control Board over air pollution permits for “minor” sources of pollution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all the bills we are likely to see this year have been filed yet (<a href="http://dls.virginia.gov/pubs/calendar/cal2022_2.pdf" target="_blank">the deadline is Friday</a>) so there is a good chance we will see further attacks on climate action, all with the pretense of saving money.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">And then there’s coal</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of things that cost ratepayers money, bills to subsidize coal are back this year. As we have all learned, coal is no longer a competitive fuel in Virginia. It lost out first to fracked gas, and more recently to solar. But in a compromise with coalfields Republicans, the VCEA excluded one coal plant, the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center (VCHEC) in Wise County, from a requirement that Dominion Energy Virginia close its Virginia coal plants this decade. In theory, VCHEC could stay open until 2045, when the VCEA requires Dominion to reach zero carbon across all its generation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In reality, though, the reprieve isn’t enough to save the coal plant. Dominion’s own analysis, from its 2020 Integrated Resource Plan case, assigned VCHEC a net present value of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">negative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $472 million just for the ten years from 2020-2029. Dominion didn’t try to extend that analysis out to 2045, but clearly the cost to customers from running a money-losing coal plant for 25 years would top a cool billion. Not surprisingly, the SCC is considering requiring Dominion to retire VCHEC to save money for its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given concerns about RGGI’s cost to consumers, you might think Southwest Virginia Republicans would lead the charge to retire the money-losing coal plant in their midst. You would be wrong. To understand why, it will help you to know that the counties making up Southwest Virginia are not in Dominion’s service territory, but in Appalachian Power’s. The people who benefit from keeping a coal plant open in Wise County are not the same people who have to pay for the plant’s spectacular losses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an excuse to keep the plant open, coalfields Republicans claim it’s to help the environment. Yes, really. Some of VCHEC’s fuel is waste coal excavated from the piles of mining waste that litter the coalfields, a toxic legacy of the era when coal was king and environmental regulations went unenforced. Burning the waste coal is one way to get rid of it, though not the only way or, for that matter, the right way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a new report from the Appalachian State School of Law discusses, the federal infrastructure bill (again, the same one Virginia Republicans voted against) will provide millions of dollars to Virginia to remediate abandoned minelands, including these piles of toxic waste. (The report, titled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing Virginia’s Legacy GOB Piles,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been sent to General Assembly members but is not yet available online.) Rather than take this opportunity, Republicans would prefer that Dominion customers be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in higher energy costs and put more pollution into the air. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So at the same time they rail against the costs of RGGI and VCEA, Republicans are using waste coal as a reason to raise costs even more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB656" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB656</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Del. William Wampler, R-Washington) dangles a tax credit for using waste coal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb120" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB120</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB657" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB657</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Wampler) declare waste coal a “renewable energy” source and exempts VCHEC from the requirement that it close by 2045.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB894" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB894</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kilgore) outright prohibits the SCC from requiring Dominion to retire VCHEC “before the end of its useful life.” (Would that be before or after Virginia becomes so hot we all move to Canada?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said before, it is early yet, and we are likely to see more such bills filed in the coming days. Electricity customers had better get used to being used as a political football by legislators who attack the costs of the energy transition but have no qualms about making ratepayers subsidize coal. </span></p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The election was a tough day for climate advocates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After two years of historic progress that included passage of the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA), the centerpiece of the Commonwealth’s plan to decarbonize the electric sector by 2050, voters handed a narrow victory to its critics. Republicans take over as governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and the House of Delegates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the campaign, former Carlyle Group CEO Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/local/gubernatorial-candidates-comment-or-choose-not-to-on-mountain-valley-pipeline/article_cbbc8432-2878-11ec-82c8-dfee2846ffd8.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">criticized</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the VCEA for raising rates and putting “our entire energy grid at risk.”  While largely supportive of solar and wind (especially offshore wind, which he “</span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/va-gov-debate-mcauliffe-and-youngkin-on-clean-energy/2815812/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wholly supports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">”), Youngkin also </span><a href="https://hburgcitizen.com/2021/08/19/mcauliffe-and-youngkin-offer-different-visions-for-shift-to-renewable-energy-in-the-valley/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">argued for more natural gas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to feed “the rip-roaring economy that I’m going to build.” This is, essentially, the old “all of the above” strategy we hoped had been buried for good, coupled with </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2021/02/26/in-the-aftermath-of-a-devastating-winter-storm-can-we-take-lessons-from-texas/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unfounded fear-mongering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about power outages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the bright side, Governor-elect Youngkin has acknowledged that climate change is real and is causing damage here in Virginia. At the same time, he supposedly told </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/11/01/cheat-sheet-youngkin-and-mcauliffe-on-the-issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Norfolk State University audience</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in October that he didn’t know what is causing climate change. It seems likely this was a clumsy lie prompted by political expedience, rather than a reflection of actual ignorance. Two years ago Youngkin </span><a href="https://www.carlyle.com/sites/default/files/reports/carlyleccr2019.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">touted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Carlyle Group’s record as “the first major private investment firm to operate on a carbon-neutral basis.” That’s not something you do just to be on trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So yes, Youngkin knows that increasing greenhouse gas emissions are driving the warming of the planet, and at Carlyle he was willing to do something about it. But now that he’s a politician, Youngkin is embracing natural gas in a way that suggests he’d rather ignore the truth about methane than take a stance unpopular in his party. Heck, for all we know, he may now even subscribe to the plan </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/red-new-deal-gop-offers-a-climate-plan-of-its-own/?utm_source=Energy+News+Network+daily+email+digests&amp;utm_campaign=6eb412854e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_05_11_11_46_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_724b1f01f5-6eb412854e-89284331" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recently laid out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by U.S. Senate Republicans to address climate change by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> natural gas production and exports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wait, you say, isn’t this also the Russian plan? Sell more gas and, if worse comes to worst, Siberia heats up enough to become a vacation destination? Let’s just say it’s not a coincidence that the senators promoting this “solution” come from North Dakota, Alaska and Wyoming—all states that are big energy exporters, but more importantly, where people think a few degrees of warming would be kind of nice. But given that the population of all three states combined is significantly less than the population of Northern Virginia alone, we probably don’t want them making policy for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that we have no idea where Youngkin stands on the need for climate solutions is only one part of the problem facing climate activists in Virginia’s upcoming legislative session. The bigger problem is that a lot of our Republican legislators are outright hostile to climate science and Virginia’s framework for the energy transition. These folks are loaded for bear, and they will use their narrow win to flood the House with bills aimed at rolling back the energy transition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to VCEA, the Republican hit list includes the Clean Energy and Community Preparedness Act, which directed Virginia to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI); the Clean Car Standard, which promotes sales of electric vehicles; and the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy, which makes the transition to a net-zero-energy economy official state policy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether these bills will pass the House is less certain, given the benefits these laws are already delivering. The VCEA spurred </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/report-ranks-virginia-fourth-among-states-for-2020-solar-installations/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“incredible growth”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in solar installations, making Virginia fourth in the nation for new solar generation in 2020, and the world’s biggest offshore wind blade manufacturer just </span><a href="https://energynews.us/2021/10/25/siemens-gamesa-chooses-virginia-for-offshore-wind-turbine-blade-factory/'" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced plans for a facility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Portsmouth, Virginia. Does anyone really want to stop that momentum? Tens of millions of dollars are already flowing to climate adaptation projects in coastal areas thanks to RGGI’s carbon allowance auctions. Pulling the plug on that cash flow would hurt Republicans representing the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notwithstanding the rhetoric, the VCEA is good for business and consumers. Ratepayers will save money through the mandated closure of uneconomic coal, oil and biomass plants, and by the removal of barriers to distributed renewable energy generation. Solar’s </span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-levelized-cost-of-storage-and-levelized-cost-of-hydrogen/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">low cost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> positions it to overtake fossil fuels as the go-to generation source for utilities, but the VCEA creates the market certainty that attracts investment. And offshore wind—the most expensive part of the VCEA, but the part Youngkin apparently likes—is also popular on both sides of the aisle as an engine of investment and job creation.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t mean anti-VCEA bills won’t pass the House; being bad policy is never enough to kill legislation, or even stop people who ought to know better from voting for it. In 2019, an anti-RGGI bill from Del. Charles Poindexter (R-Franklin) passed both the House and Senate on party-line votes. It was prevented from taking effect only </span><a href="https://roanoke.com/news/politics/governor-vetoes-two-bills-from-del-charles-poindexter-saying-they-would-undermine-climate-change-fight/article_8e23751e-5164-582d-9fa0-6486917df041.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thanks to a veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Governor Northam. Today, I can count very few House Republicans who won’t toe the same party line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Democrats still in charge of the Senate, Youngkin isn’t likely to find a RGGI or VCEA repeal on his desk. Creating an energy transition framework was one of the Democrats’ biggest successes in the past two years, and protecting that success will be a party priority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are many ways Republicans can undercut climate action. They might attract just enough Democratic votes with bills that, for example, grant exemptions for powerful industries that have friends among Senate Democrats. They could also use the budget process to undermine the transition by starving agencies and grant programs of funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If politics doesn’t completely get in the way, though, there should be room for consensus on some new areas of progress. Highly efficient schools with solar roofs save money for taxpayers; electric school buses are good for children’s health; solar on abandoned mine sites promise employment to residents of Southwest Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the General Assembly, executive agencies have had the job of implementing all the various parts of the RGGI program and the VCEA. And the agencies, of course, answer to the governor. The Department of Environmental Quality will have signed off—or not—on the Mountain Valley Pipeline’s permits before Younkin takes office, but after that, we can expect DEQ to return to being the easy-permitting, lax-enforcing agency it was of old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the Department of Energy, that agency has been going gangbusters turning Virginia into a clean energy leader and promoting new models like brownfields redevelopment and clean energy financing. Hopefully those efforts offer so much in the way of economic opportunities that a businessman like Youngkin will want them to continue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that, like so much else, remains to be seen. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, folks, the kids are back in school, so in their honor we are all going to do a word problem! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Rich lives in a sprawling subdivision of large, single-family homes. Bob has a pool and a hot tub and outdoor lights he keeps on all night. Bob’s four children have loads of electronic gadgetry, plus a habit of leaving windows open when the air conditioner is blasting. Needless to say, the Rich family uses a lot of electricity. But Bob doesn’t worry too much about his utility bill. It’s really not that much compared to all the other bills he pays; and fortunately, his wife is a hedge fund lawyer so he can afford it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Poore, on the other hand, lives in a small apartment and uses as little electricity as possible to save money. He works a low-wage job, and his best efforts to attract a wealthy spouse have not yet panned out. John uses air conditioning only on the hottest summer days. He switched out his incandescent lightbulbs for LEDs, caulked the cracks around his windows where air leaked in, and when his old refrigerator broke, he replaced it with an EnergyStar model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob and John are both customers of Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative, in western Virginia. SVEC says its costs are going up, so it has been “adjusting” its rates. What would you expect the effects to be?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A) Bob’s bills go up more than John’s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">B) Both Bob and John’s bills go up by the same amount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C) John’s bills go up more than Bob’s (and Bob’s might even go down).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably already figured out it’s a trick question. We’re dealing with a Virginia utility, so the answer can’t be (A) regardless of that being the obvious and rational answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, answer (A) is how most utilities operate: Every customer pays a small fixed fee, typically under $10, and the rest of the bill is determined by how much electricity the customer uses. People who use a lot of electricity pay the most. They are usually better able to afford it, but if they don’t like the size of their bills, they can turn off the lights in empty rooms, change their thermostat setting, invest in energy efficiency, or put solar panels on the roof. Conserving energy and adding renewable energy happen to be public policy priorities, so the incentives are aligned with the behavior society wants to encourage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But SVEC notes that a lot of its costs aren’t dependent on how much electricity customers use; it has wires to maintain and so forth, plus it recently “invested” in a beautiful and spacious new headquarters that it </span><a href="https://www.svec.coop/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/New-Facility-FAQs-for-website.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">swore</span></a> <a href="https://www.svec.coop/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/New-Facility-FAQs-for-website.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wouldn’t mean rate increases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (but, well, you know how that goes). SVEC says Bob and John benefit equally from all these investments, and wants their bills to reflect that. Early last year SVEC “adjusted” its rate structure to increase the fixed customer fee from $13 to $25 and decrease the rate per kilowatt-hour of electricity used. If you chose answer (C), you were correct!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, to raise more revenue, </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4s%23701!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SVEC proposes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to increase everybody’s fixed fee again, this time to $30. For customers who don’t use much electricity, that fixed fee could become the biggest charge on the bill, and one that can’t ever be reduced by any amount of energy conservation, efficiency or solar panels. They may also wonder whether $30 is just a stop on the way to even higher fixed fees that will further undercut their energy-saving investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SVEC didn’t need anyone’s approval when it almost doubled the fixed fee last year. But this year, the State Corporation Commission has to approve the additional changes, so customers finally have a chance to challenge them. Utilities around the state are watching what the SCC does. If SVEC gets approval to shift more of its costs away from customers who use a lot of electricity and onto those who use the least, other utilities will see that as a green light </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2017/10/25/electric-co-op-seeks-to-double-fixed-access-charge-in-move-against-solar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to do the same</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Utilities prefer fixed charges because they provide revenue certainty; left to their own devices, they will move as much of their revenue into the fixed-cost category and increase fixed charges as high as they can. Unfortunately, doing so creates an incentive for utilities to spend as much as possible on infrastructure costs that can be recovered through fixed rates. That will raise costs for everyone and produce a further perverse incentive for the utility to encourage energy consumption (and waste) in order to make maximum use of the infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t the result anyone should want, and especially a nonprofit electric cooperative. More affluent, high-use customers will benefit from lower rates per kilowatt-hour, while low-income customers will be less able to control their bills, an inequity that flies in the face of Virginia’s efforts to limit the energy burden on low-income residents. And customers who are considering investing in energy efficiency or solar will find they are looking at a longer payback time, discouraging the energy-saving measures that Virginia strives to promote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC will hold a hearing Wednesday to consider SVEC’s proposed rate increase. The commission should reject SVEC’s efforts to raise fixed charges for customers and send the utility back to the rate-drawing board. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Some while back I was engaged in an online discussion with other solar advocates about renewable energy — specifically, how to get more of it built. Some of the participants I knew, others I did not. The conversation was lively, ranging from the need for better education to public policy and incentives.</p>
<p>But then one of the participants threw in an unexpected comment. His email read, “Aren’t we all tired of synagogues?”</p>
<p>The question stopped me cold. I had never heard anyone express weariness of synagogues, much less understood that to be a consensus sentiment. However, I’m not Jewish, so if it were something my Jewish friends grumbled about among themselves but did not share more widely, then I wouldn’t necessarily know about it.</p>
<p>But our discussion was about renewable energy, so surely the comment could not really be about a physical house of worship. “Synagogue” had to be shorthand for something else. If someone said “aren’t we all tired of church,” it might be understood to refer to doctrinal thinking, or more likely, to preaching. You could see how someone would be tired of renewable energy advocates preaching about the benefits of wind turbines and solar panels. Could “synagogue” be meant as a sort of metaphor for haranguing people?</p>
<p>It seemed like a stretch, even assuming the person who had made the comment was Jewish, which I didn’t know. I looked back at the email to see if the name might give me a clue. At that moment, another email came through from him: “Sorry about that autocorrect, it was supposed to be ‘<em>subsidies</em>.’”</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>I was relieved that synagogue fatigue was off the table, but now I had a new question to ponder: Are we, in fact, all tired of subsidies?</p>
<p>Opposition to subsidies is one of the touchstones of free-market capitalism, and even within the wind and solar industries you will find believers in the proposition that if a technology can’t attract enough customers on its own merits, it deserves to remain niche, and the government ought not to put its fat thumb on the scale.</p>
<p>Republican attacks on the Virginia Clean Economy Act, passed last year by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly, are often framed as opposition to the government “picking winners and losers.” The law certainly does that, by directing utilities to close coal plants and incorporate an increasing percentage of electricity from wind and solar.</p>
<p>Some Republicans are raising the same objection in response to the Biden administration’s plans for addressing the climate crisis. Technological advances and market forces are already moving us inexorably towards a clean energy economy—but not fast enough. So Biden’s initiatives rely on the full range of government powers, subsidies among them, to drive down greenhouse gas emissions nationwide in an effort to avoid a worldwide climate catastrophe.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: to the extent the U.S. has anything resembling an energy policy, subsidies have always been a tool of first resort. Indeed, this has been the case literally <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/89/i51/Long-History-US-Energy-Subsidies.html" target="_blank">since the nation’s founding</a>. Often the difference between Republicans and Democrats is not in whether they embrace subsidies, but which ones they favor.</p>
<p>Cash grants, tax credits, loan guarantees, low-cost access to public land, public purchasing requirements, protective tariffs and federal R&amp;D funding all shape the way energy is produced, delivered and consumed, and they are responsible for the fossil-fuel heavy energy economy we have today. Even U.S. foreign policy and our military have been deployed for the benefit of extractive industries. A century ago, the National Guard <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/forgotten-matewan-massacre-was-epicenter-20th-century-mine-wars-180963026/" target="_blank">came to the aid of the coal barons</a> against striking miners. More recently, a think tank crunched numbers to estimate the U.S. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/21/us-spends-81-billion-a-year-to-protect-oil-supplies-report-estimates.html" target="_blank">spends $81 billion per year</a> to  protect global oil supplies. That figure rises to over $3 trillion if you count <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2014/mar/20/iraq-war-oil-resources-energy-peak-scarcity-economy" target="_blank">the Iraq war</a>.</p>
<p>Externalities matter, too. If an industry is allowed to inflict damage to a community’s air and water, that is a form of subsidy that can be partly measured in dollars spent on health care and clean-up. Regulations requiring expensive pollution controls can lessen the economic advantages of offloading costs onto the public, but any remaining costs shouldered by the public are a subsidy to the polluter.</p>
<p>Conversely, by displacing fossil fuels, a clean energy facility may confer a public benefit far exceeding the cost of any government subsidy it receives. When we’re dealing with climate change, the public benefit of carbon-free energy is immense.</p>
<p>None of this is an argument against the merits of free market competition, which remains the economy’s most important driver of innovation leading to better and cleaner energy technologies. Well-designed subsidies should work with the market, not against it, to speed the energy transition towards a net-zero future.</p>
<p>And to that we should all say, Amen.</p>

Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The politicization of coronavirus vaccines and mask-wearing has been a depressing reminder of the downside of American individualism. The successful functioning of a free republic depends on people taking personal responsibility for their actions. Too often now that translates into a disregard for the rights of others, coupled with an insistence that our own opinions, even if they are founded on the shifting sands of rumor, must be given as much respect as any expert’s.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of COVID-19, the results have been catastrophic: the loss of hundreds of thousands of American lives, hospital stays for millions more and lingering disability for a number we can’t yet calculate. They are as much victims of the ideology of personal freedom as of the virus itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers (usually but not always the same people) could choose to stay home so as not to endanger others by their choices, and perhaps some do. But many claim a right to go where they please, be served in whatever businesses they wish to frequent and send their children unmasked to schools that they insist must be open. Confronted with some version of the maxim that your right to swing your arm ends where the other guy’s nose begins, they insist the other guy ought to swing his arm, too, because bloody noses aren’t real. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 is not the only example of the damage that ensues when a large segment of society elevates the rights of individuals over obligations to society. Second Amendment absolutism has led to the peculiar result that the right to own a gun is valued more highly in law than the right not to be killed by one. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would argue that the refusal on the part of a vocal minority to even acknowledge climate change and the role of humans in causing it similarly has its roots in American individualism. To concede we are in a crisis is to accept the need for action to counter the rise in atmospheric CO2. Though the collective benefits of action are enormous (extending even to the ability of our civilization to endure), some individual sacrifice has to happen in the short term. Yet for some people, individual sacrifice in the service of the greater good is unthinkable. What’s in it for them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why climate activists (myself included) so often emphasize the benefits to individuals of the energy transition: cleaner air, the superior comfort of energy-efficient homes, lower electricity bills from cheap wind and solar. Even the appeal to parental love — Save the planet for your children! — assumes the primacy of self-interest. But that avoids the more difficult question of what my obligation is to my neighbor’s children, or for that matter, children elsewhere in the world. What do human beings owe to each other?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may feel impossible to have a serious conversation about rights and responsibilities when our public sphere is so contaminated by falsehoods, mistrust and conspiracy theories. But we still have to try, because the ability of our society to navigate the many challenges ahead of us depends on a consensus about what we owe to one another. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Successfully tackling the big issues – both familiar ones like the economy, racial and wealth inequality, and threats from abroad, and emerging threats like cyberterrorism, climate chaos, plastic pollution and looming ecological collapse — requires collective action. A nation of individuals all fiercely guarding their individual rights and recognizing no responsibilities towards others is on its way to collapse.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Corporation Commission recently finalized </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-585.1:12/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Multifamily Shared Solar Program, created by the General Assembly to give residents of apartment buildings and condominiums the ability to use solar energy from panels installed on their buildings. But in implementing the program, the SCC also made sure it can never be used.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy is largely to blame here, as it so often is whenever customer-sited solar encounters barriers. The utility proposed to lard up the program with fees, none of them allowed by the law. But it’s the SCC’s agreement with Dominion that’s the problem—and not just for people in apartment buildings who want solar, but for the future of any solar in Virginia that isn’t utility-owned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020’s Solar Freedom law set out to make it easier for residents and businesses to install solar onsite. At the heart of the law is net metering, the program that credits solar owners for excess electricity fed back into the grid. Net metering makes solar affordable for customers, so giving more people access to net metering means more private investment dollars, more jobs and a more resilient power grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-585.1:12/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">multifamily shared solar provision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is meant to extend net metering-like benefits to residents of apartment buildings and condominiums, who don’t own their building and its roof themselves. The law allows the building owner—a landlord or condo association—to have solar panels installed on the property, and let residents buy the electricity produced.  Residents who sign up for solar are to be credited for the solar electricity at the utility’s retail rate, giving the residents a benefit equivalent to net metering. The only added cost the utility is allowed to impose is an administrative fee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Administrative fee.” You probably think you know what that term means: a fee to cover the cost of administering the program because, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">duh, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what else could it mean? It would pay for someone to do paperwork, or to tweak the billing software. It couldn’t amount to more than a buck or two for a customer in the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You think that way because you are not a Dominion lawyer. With no definition of “administrative fee” in the law, and no dollar limit, Dominion’s lawyers went to work shoveling every conceivable expense they could come up with into the humble little fee until it resembles one of those </span><a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/giant-cats-photoshop-edits-fransdita-muafidin/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">memes of a kitten the size of Godzilla</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now the administrative fee includes the utility’s transmission and distribution costs; standby generation; balancing costs; “nonbypassable charges”; even “banking, balancing and storing fees related to the utility&#8217;s processing and handling of the excess bill credits.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the SCC, faced with this long list of fees that have nothing to do with program administration and aren’t authorized in the law, closed its eyes and signed on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the regulations don’t tell us what all the kitten-stuffing charges add up to. To determine the dollar amounts, the SCC references “parallel rate proceedings,” by which it means regulations being written to implement a different law, also passed in 2020, creating a much larger program under the name of </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/56-594.3/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shared Solar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And right now, in those parallel rate proceedings, Dominion is insisting that those various fees </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4s%25301!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">should add up to nearly $75</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per customer per month. Mind you, that amount does not include the cost of the electricity from the solar panels. Adding $75 to the price of electricity makes the cost of buying solar energy through the program far more than the cost of buying electricity from Dominion. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_27699" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1200px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_dominion_energy-02.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-27699" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_dominion_energy-02.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_dominion_energy-02.jpg 1200w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_dominion_energy-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_dominion_energy-02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_dominion_energy-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_dominion_energy-02-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_dominion_energy-02-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/210609_dominion_energy-02-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dominion Energy offices in Richmond, Va. (Parker Michels-Boyce/ For The Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carrying those charges over to the multifamily program instantly kills it. No landlord would install solar expecting residents to pay an extra $75 per month for their electricity. The result makes a mockery of Solar Freedom’s intent for “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">robust project development and shared solar program access for all customer classes.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, the law expressly requires the utility to credit customers at the retail rate, which is to be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“inclusive of all supply charges, delivery charges, demand charges, fixed charges, and any applicable riders or other charges to the customer.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole point is to block the utility from piling on costs, excepting only that little kitten of an administrative fee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point the only way to salvage the multifamily program is for the General Assembly to amend the law. With the SCC refusing to understand the meaning of “administrative,” the only thing legislators can do is put a dollar limit on the kitten. Indeed, a dollar seems like the right amount. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would resurrect the multifamily solar program. As for the shared solar program, where Dominion first came up with the idea of penalizing customers $75 a month for buying solar energy from someone else, the SCC is still working on regulations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two programs are based on very different laws. Where Solar Freedom’s multifamily solar provision mimics net metering, and therefore allows the utility to charge only an administrative fee, the shared solar law explicitly contemplates customers paying a “minimum bill” that will include transmission and distribution, standby charges, and so on, in addition to a (presumably for-real) administrative fee. All those bloated charges that Dominion shoehorned into the administrative fee for apartments and condos in clear violation of the legislative mandate, are expressly allowed by the shared solar law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except, of course, no one said anything about $75.  If customers have to pay Dominion $75 in addition to whatever they have to pay to the solar provider, no one will sign up, and there will not be a program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The implications are not confined to shared solar laws. Dominion is laying a foundation to set a high floor for customer billings that will be independent of how much electricity residents use, where it comes from, whether their use of renewable energy provides a public benefit, or even whether customer-generated solar reduces other utility costs.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solar industry and other parties have strenuously objected to Dominion’s calculations. They have also asked the SCC to hold an evidentiary hearing on the amount of the minimum bill to be charged to shared solar customers (and by extension, to multifamily solar customers via kitten-stuffing). The request gives the SCC a chance to weigh benefits as well as costs, and produce an outcome that will ensure a future for shared solar in Virginia. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury 2019) </p><p>More than $4.3 billion in federal stimulus dollars will be flowing to Virginia this year as part of the American Rescue Plan, with cities and counties in line for another $2.7 billion. In a <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2021/may/headline-895119-en.html" target="_blank">joint statement</a> in May, Governor Northam and Democratic leaders laid out spending priorities that included rehabilitating and upgrading the infrastructure in public schools. The General Assembly plans to meet for a special legislative session in August to allocate the funds. In addition to the federal money, Virginia also finds itself in the happy position of having surplus funds of its own to spend.</p>
<p>As it stands now, the federal funds cannot be used for new school construction, a restriction that upsets school officials in areas with aging schools and no budget to replace them. But whether some money is spent on new schools or not, the General Assembly should not just throw dollars out the door and hope for the best. Virginia has an enormous opportunity to improve student health and learning, correct historic injustices, and meet the demands of the climate crisis, but only if the right standards are in place from the outset.</p>
<p>First, funding should be prioritized to Title 1 schools, which are those with at least 40 percent of children from low-income families. Given Virginia’s history of segregation and racism, a high number of Title 1 schools are in Black communities, while others are in parts of rural Virginia that have been left behind economically.  Title 1 schools on average are older and in worse condition than schools in more affluent areas, and the students are more likely to suffer from asthma and other health problems that are exacerbated by mold and poor indoor air quality. Improving indoor air quality and student well-being should be the primary goals for all new or renovated facilities, and it makes sense to start with the students most in need.</p>
<p>Second, while many localities are attracted to the idea of shiny new schools, in most cases it takes less time and costs less to retrofit an old school that is structurally sound than to tear it down and build new. It’s also <a href="https://science.time.com/2012/01/27/leed-from-behind-why-we-should-focus-on-greening-existing-buildings/" target="_blank">better for the environment</a>, even if the new school would be built to a “green” standard. Children don’t need new buildings; they need healthy, high-performing buildings. A beautiful remodel of the historic school their parents and grandparents attended could be just what the doctor ordered.</p>
<p>Third, new or renovated schools should be required to meet the <a href="https://chps.net/" target="_blank">highest standards</a> for energy efficiency, including windows, insulation and HVAC. New construction should also be all-electric, as should most renovated buildings. This maximizes taxpayer savings on energy costs over the lifetime of the building, supports the goal of healthy indoor air, and is consistent with Virginia’s commitment to phase out fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Fourth, if the roof will be new or upgraded, it should be made solar-ready, allowing the school to take advantage of third-party power purchase agreements (PPAs) or solar services agreements to install solar panels. Leveraging private capital to pay for the school’s primary energy source stretches construction dollars. These agreements provide financing for solar facilities at no upfront cost and typically save money for schools from the outset. Once the solar panels are paid off, energy bills plummet and savings pile up.</p>
<p>New schools and deep retrofits can even achieve net-zero status affordably, and ought to be required to do so in most cases. Net-zero schools become a source of community pride and offer educational benefits as students learn about energy and how solar panels work. According to a <a href="https://www.fcps.edu/sites/default/files/Net-Zero-Energy-Study.pdf" target="_blank">study conducted for Fairfax County Public Schools</a>, the additional upfront cost of building a net-zero-ready school (one that will produce as much energy as it uses once solar panels are added) is only about 5 percent more than standard construction, and the additional cost is recovered through energy savings in under 10 years. Renovating older schools to net-zero costs 11 percent more, but still pays off in 15 years.</p>
<p>Even if we weren’t worried about climate, these standards would make sense for student health and taxpayer savings. Yet today, school districts are not required to build high performance schools, and most don’t. The result is higher operating costs, and in some cases <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0olA-0j8Xg" target="_blank">school boards being told</a> that their brand-new schools won’t support solar. Solar companies say it’s probable that solar would be just fine, but this shouldn’t even be an issue. Yet it will continue to be cited as an obstacle if solar-readiness is not made standard.</p>
<p>Our children deserve better. Virginia should seize this year’s historic opportunity to invest in healthy, high-performing schools that are free of fossil fuels and will deliver long-term benefits for taxpayers and the climate.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fredericksburg </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelance-Star</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ran an </span><a href="https://fredericksburg.com/opinion/commentary-with-deregulation-virginians-can-expect-higher-electric-bills/article_bb6ad3f6-e14f-5ff0-8d16-9c31d151fec5.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Power for Tomorrow’s executive director, Gary C. Meltz, opposing deregulation in the electric sector; the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mercury</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ran a </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/inbox-on-electric-regulation/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to my article from Mr. Meltz; another mailer arrived from Power for Tomorrow, even more unhinged about Clean Virginia and what it calls “their Texas-style policies”; and the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roanoke Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ran an </span><a href="https://roanoke.com/opinion/columnists/suetterlein-electric-choice-bad-for-the-monopolies-great-for-working-virginians/article_c4c1fc06-c564-11eb-9888-bfa55de9bdc1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">op-ed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Republican Sen. David Sutterlein in favor of electricity choice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Meltz’ </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freelance-Star</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> op-ed argues that regulated monopolies produce lower cost power for consumers than competitive markets. Instead of developing the argument, however, most of the op-ed is devoted to horror stories about Texas and Maryland. In both states, poor regulation led to high bills, in Texas because customers were allowed to participate in “low-cost” billing options that charged them astronomical real-time power costs during the winter freeze, and in Maryland because unscrupulous power providers lured low-income customers into overpriced contracts with up-front goodies like gift cards. But are these abuses the necessary result of deregulated markets? It seems Power for Tomorrow would like you to think so, but it doesn’t necessarily follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sutterlein’s op-ed argues that Dominion has abused its political power for private gain, citing legislation like the notorious 2015 “rate freeze” bill that allowed the company to hang on to over-earnings it would otherwise have had to refund to customers. His cure for these abuses is deregulation, allowing customers to choose other electricity providers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A reader might ask, does curbing Dominion’s excessive profits require deregulation, or just better regulation by the General Assembly and the SCC? Personally, I’m agnostic on this issue. I would welcome a data-driven discussion of whether carefully-designed free markets deliver more for the public than a well-regulated monopoly system coupled with a ban on campaign contributions from public utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if Power for Tomorrow is really interested in consumer protection, it’s just plain weird that its ads are so squarely focused on trying to take down Clean Virginia, an organization whose entire purpose is to secure lower costs for consumers. It’s hard not to suspect that the real point of the attack ads is to protect the high profits of Power for Tomorrow’s utility funders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Mr. Meltz, those over- the-top mailers are indeed getting results for Power for Tomorrow. In his </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Mercury</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> letter, Meltz says his organization’s “education campaign” has produced 4,324 letters to elected officials and 1,607 petition signatures. Meltz also says Power for Tomorrow’s funding (and spending) will become a public record when they submit paperwork to the IRS. He doesn’t say when that will be; and he isn’t telling now.</span></p>

(Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s campaign season in Virginia, with primary elections coming up on June 6. But in addition to all the candidate flyers arriving in mailboxes, Virginia residents have been receiving another kind of mailer with a message unrelated to the election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Oversized, campaign-style postcards from an entity calling itself Power for Tomorrow warn, “Clean Virginia wants to end customer protections on electricity — leaving Virginians stuck with #BigBills like Texas!” Quotes from headlines about last winter’s disastrous power outage in Texas sprinkle the page to drive home the message that “It happened in Texas. Don’t let it happen in Virginia.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The flip side of the postcard reads, “We can’t allow so-called ‘Clean Virginia’ to spend millions to influence Richmond politicians and make hardworking Virginians pay more for electricity.” The cards then urge people to join a texting campaign targeting legislators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s going on here? According to the nonprofit </span><a href="https://www.energyandpolicy.org/power-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy and Policy Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Power for Tomorrow is a utility front group that is “Virginia-based and Dominion Energy-connected.” Power for Tomorrow “opposes efforts to introduce greater competition to monopoly utilities and provides a platform for former regulators to advocate for utility interests.” Its directors and experts are mostly lawyers and lobbyists who represent utility interests. Its </span><a href="https://www.powerfortomorrow.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> claims the Texas power outage “catalyzed the launch” of the group, but Energy and Policy Institute notes that the website first launched in 2019, and only re-launched this year following the Texas debacle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the postcard mailer, Power for Tomorrow has also run television and Facebook ads. </span><a href="https://vpm.org/news/articles/22344/dominion-energy-linked-group-launches-300k-ad-blitz-after-texas-storm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Virginia Public Media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as of May 14 the organization had spent at least $220,000 on TV ads and at least another $90,000 on Facebook ads. Dominion Energy spokesperson Rayhan Daudani told Virginia Public Media that Dominion is “proud to support Power for Tomorrow and its efforts to educate people about the dangers of electric deregulation.” He also asserted Dominion’s political contributions, including those to Power for Tomorrow, were “bipartisan and transparent.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bipartisan part is true; </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/donors/120206-dominion-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Public Access Project records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show Dominion gives money to both Democrats and Republicans. Doing so ensures the company has influence no matter which party holds power. Dominion’s political donations to Virginia elected leaders add up to over $3 million in just the last year and a half (making its criticism of Clean Virginia’s spending more than a little hypocritical). “Transparent” is another matter, however; neither VPAP nor any other source I could find reveals how much money Dominion has provided to Power for Tomorrow.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the claims about customer protections, the mailer’s message stands Clean Virginia’s purpose on its head. </span><a href="https://www.cleanvirginia.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> advocates for decreasing the influence of utilities on the General Assembly and increasing regulatory oversight by the State Corporation Commission. The legislation it supported in 2021 uniformly would have returned more money to customers.  The reason Clean Virginia “spends millions to influence Richmond politicians” is to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">counter</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dominion Energy’s spending and political influence in Richmond. There would be no need for Clean Virginia if the General Assembly weren’t already under the utility’s thumb. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Clean Virginia’s website, the five energy reform bills the group supported in 2021 were:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2200" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2200</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, restoring SCC discretion over Dominion rate-setting and accounting practices</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1984%A0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1984</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing the SCC to set future rates to reflect the true cost of service</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1914" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1914</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, giving the SCC the ability to set the time period for utilities to recover large one-time expenses, eliminating an accounting gimmick that benefited utilities at the expense of customers</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2160" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2160</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">, requiring utilities to return 100% of overcharges to customers, instead of being allowed to keep 30 percent</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2049" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2049</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also aimed at supporting rate reductions or refunds</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these bills passed the House with bipartisan support but failed in the Senate, where the Commerce and Labor committee remains Dominion-friendly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Power for Tomorrow ads don’t try to defend Dominion’s opposition to customer-friendly legislation. Instead, they reference a broader effort by Clean Virginia and </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/coalition-of-unlikely-allies-calls-on-state-to-break-up-utilities-deregulate-energy/2019/05/07/72916a2e-70e9-11e9-8be0-ca575670e91c_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an unusual alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of several progressive and conservative free-market groups to restructure Virginia’s utilities. Calling themselves the Virginia Energy Reform Coalition, the allies supported legislation in 2020 that would have separated the generation and transmission functions of Dominion and Appalachian Power and introduced competition in the sale of electricity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether the long-term effects of this kind of energy deregulation would be good or bad for Virginia residents is a matter of furious debate, but clearly the legislation would have hurt Dominion’s profits. In any event, the bill never even got a vote last year, and was not brought back in 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Power for Tomorrow campaign deliberately muddies the water. While mentioning only the stillborn deregulation effort, its attacks on Clean Virginia are meant to undercut support for other legislation that increases utility regulation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what about the threat of Texas-style power outages? Where is the connection? Power for Tomorrow would like you to believe that competition leads to disaster. But the mailer is vague about how what happened in Texas might happen here, and for good reason: It won’t. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2021/02/26/in-the-aftermath-of-a-devastating-winter-storm-can-we-take-lessons-from-texas/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happened in Texas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was due to generating facilities (mostly natural gas) freezing up and failing to deliver electricity to the state’s isolated power grid. With too much demand and not enough supply, short-term power costs soared, and people who’d opted for electricity plans that tracked real-time prices received astronomical bills. Simple regulatory fixes could have avoided both the blackouts and the sky-high bills, but Texas politicians and grid operators shied away from imposing those requirements. Failure to regulate, not deregulation, was to blame. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the lights go out in Virginia, by contrast, downed power lines and blown transformers are typically to blame. In other words, the problem is in the delivery, not the generation. Our electricity supply is more secure than Texas’ because Virginia is part of the larger </span><a href="https://www.pjm.com/about-pjm/who-we-are" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PJM transmission grid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that covers all or parts of 13 states from the East to the Midwest. Not only does PJM have a huge excess of generating capacity, but generators have to guarantee they will deliver electricity when called on, and would be penalized by failure to winterize their facilities. Those guarantees are absent in Texas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introducing competition to the Virginia utility market would not change any of this. Some states within PJM have deregulated utilities, others have vertically-integrated utilities like Virginia’s. The Texas blackouts were scary; they are also a red herring.  Apparently the cynics at Power for Tomorrow think there is nothing wrong with a non sequitur if it gets people’s attention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But is it getting their attention? I checked with a couple of legislators, neither of whom had received any texts or emails from constituents generated by the advertising. Either the campaign isn’t working, or Power for Tomorrow is just building out a mailing list to deploy later, perhaps in the next legislative session when regulatory reform bills come up again.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that point we may find out whether Dominion has built an anti-reform constituency with these misleading ads, or just added fuel to the fire. </span></p>

(Dominion Energy)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia residents who want to do right by the planet are confronted with a bewildering array of renewable energy and “green power” options. Unfortunately, few of these programs actually deliver renewable energy. People who want the gold standard — electricity from new wind and solar projects — are completely out of luck if their utility is Dominion Energy Virginia or Appalachian Power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand how there can be so many options and none of them good, we first have to talk about renewable energy certificates.  RECs are a topic that is way more interesting than it sounds because — well, it would have to be, wouldn’t it? RECs are how we know that some electricity can be attributed to a renewable source. If you want to know what kind of renewable energy your utility is buying, or if you yourself want to buy renewable energy, RECs matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RECs are not electricity; they aren’t even real certificates. They were conceived of as an accounting tool enabling a utility to show it is in compliance with a state mandate to include a percentage of renewable energy in its mix. A utility amasses RECs associated with its own renewable generating sources, or buys them from renewable sources it doesn’t own, and then “retires” them to show compliance with the law. Since RECs are separate from the electricity itself, they can be bought and sold independently. There is even an </span><a href="https://www.pjm-eis.com/getting-started/about-GATS" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online marketplace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your REC shopping convenience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RECs are also how voluntary buyers of renewable energy, like customers of Arcadia or Dominion’s Green Power Program, know they’re actually getting what they pay for —assuming they understand that what they pay for is not actually energy, and may have no relationship to the electricity powering their home or business. If you buy RECs, you are still using whatever electricity your utility provides, but you are also paying a premium on top of your regular bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no nationwide, generally accepted definition of “renewable energy,” just as there is no definition of “natural” in food labeling. In Virginia, there is a state law defining what counts as renewable, and it includes not just solar, wind and hydro, but also a range of burnable fuels like biomass and municipal solid waste that </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/02/whats-not-to-like-about-biomass-deforestation-pollution-and-overpriced-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">foul the air and contribute to climate change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Buyer beware!  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Clean Economy Act narrowed the list of sources that Dominion and APCo can use to meet the law’s new renewable portfolio standard, and also limited the locations of qualifying facilities. After 2025, happily, most of the RECs retired by Dominion and APCo under the VCEA will come from Virginia wind and solar facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But crucially, the VCEA didn’t change the definition of renewable energy in the code. Dominion won’t be able to use RECs from its biomass plants to meet the VCEA, but it can still sell them to anyone else and label the product “renewable” without falling afoul of the law. Anyone buying a renewable energy product from Dominion had better check the list of ingredients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just Dominion. Anyone buying RECs from Arcadia or anywhere else should take a good look at what they are getting, and ask themselves if the money they spend means new renewable energy will be added to the grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is probably no. If the RECs come from a wind farm in Texas or Iowa, the electricity from those turbines doesn’t feed into the grid that serves Virginia, so you can’t even pretend it is powering your house. It also doesn’t mean anyone built a wind farm because of REC buyers like you. Wind energy is already the cheapest form of new energy in the central part of the U.S. People build wind farms because they are profitable, not because they can sell RECs. In fact, those wind farms are swimming in surplus RECs, because states in the center of the country don’t have renewable energy mandates to make their own utilities buy them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For that matter, a lot of RECs come from facilities that were built before the idea of RECs even existed. Hundred-year-old hydroelectric dams can sell RECs; so can fifty-year-old paper mills that sell biomass RECs from burning wood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this background, let’s look at the offerings available in Virginia and see which are worth paying more for. </span></p>
<h2><b>Dominion Energy Virginia</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In theory, Dominion customers will have the ability to buy real solar energy directly from independent providers beginning as early as 2023, thanks to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">shared solar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislation sponsored by Sen. Scott Surovell and Del. Jay Jones and passed in 2020. The </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-594.3/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> envisions independent solar developers building solar facilities in Virginia and selling the electricity (and the RECs) to subscribers who are Dominion customers. But the SCC </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/10/30/the-sccs-vanishing-trick-turning-shared-solar-into-no-solar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened a Pandora’s box</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last fall by allowing Dominion to propose the rules, and in an act of classic Dominion overreach, the utility has now proposed to collect </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4s%25301!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an average of $75 a month</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a “minimum bill” from every customer who buys solar energy from someone else. A fee like that would end the program before it ever started.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lel62viu5l"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/05/19/on-shared-solar-dominion-and-solar-groups-clash-over-75-minimum-bill-proposal/">On shared solar, Dominion and solar groups clash over $75 minimum bill proposal</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;On shared solar, Dominion and solar groups clash over $75 minimum bill proposal&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2021/05/19/on-shared-solar-dominion-and-solar-groups-clash-over-75-minimum-bill-proposal/embed/#?secret=3J6Ii9vnf8#?secret=lel62viu5l" data-secret="lel62viu5l" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The matter is hardly settled. The solar industry has asked for an evidentiary hearing and suggested that the minimum bill should be set at a single dollar. If all else fails, the program may go forward serving only low-income customers, whom the legislation exempts from the minimum bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion customers can hope for the best, but any shared solar option is still at least two years away. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, the utility’s website lists four renewable energy options: two that sell RECs, one that sells actual energy (and retires the RECs for you) and one that doesn’t exist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The REC-based </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Power Program</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been around for a decade, and as of 2019 it had </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/getattachment/526741c7-780e-4f37-ad52-d83b008be52f/dev_renew_19.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 31,000 subscribers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Dominion’s “</span><a href="https://cdn-dominionenergy-prd-001.azureedge.net/-/media/pdfs/virginia/save-energy/2019-dev-degp-combined-hpcl-ppcl.pdf?la=en&amp;rev=f651bfc9e4d84f68a6d05c618797711f&amp;hash=74598D49B36FDC3FBABA584E5D90880E" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">product content label</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">” projected that for 2020 the program would likely consist of 56 percent wind RECs, 34 percent biomass RECs, and 10 percent solar RECs. Facilities are advertised as being “in Virginia and the surrounding region,” but the fine print reveals sources as far away as Mississippi, Georgia, Missouri and Alabama, none of which are part of the PJM transmission grid that serves Virginia.  (Side note: the biomass icon is a cow, not a tree, which is misleading but charming, unless they might be burning cows, in which case it is deeply disturbing.) With the website out of date, I contacted Dominion for current content information: solar is now up to 13 percent, but, sadly, biomass still makes up 35 percent of the mix (but now it has a leaf icon!).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">REC Select</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. When I say “buyer beware,” </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/08/green-power-for-suckers-program-gets-scc-approval/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have this offering in mind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Dominion has been authorized to go Dumpster diving to buy the cheapest RECs from around the country and from any facility that meets Virginia’s overly-expansive definition of renewable energy. The website implies that so far the company is only buying wind RECs from Oklahoma and Nebraska, an indication of just how cheap those are. But under the terms of the program, the RECs could come from 50-year-old paper mills in Ohio or hundred-year-old hydroelectric dams. No educated consumer would buy this product, and both Dominion and the SCC should be ashamed of themselves for putting it out there.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">100% Renewable Energy Program</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delivers actual energy from Virginia, and retires RECs on your behalf. That’s the good news. But only a few of the solar farms are new; the rest of the energy comes from old hydro plants and, worse, from biomass plants that are so highly polluting that they don’t qualify for Virginia’s renewable energy mandate under the VCEA. The inclusion of biomass makes the program more expensive than it would be otherwise. So why include biomass when no one wants it? Because Dominion </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/22/dominion-creates-new-choices-to-limit-choices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t really care</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you sign up for this program. The company only offers it to close off a provision in the law that allowed customers to buy renewable energy from competitors if their own utility doesn’t offer it.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Dominion’s website does list one attractive program under the name “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">community solar.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” Like the shared solar program already discussed, it would deliver actual solar energy from new facilities to be built in Virginia, while retiring the RECs on your behalf. This would pass all our tests, except that it doesn’t exist. The SCC gave Dominion the green light to offer the program </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/09/14/dominions-community-solar-program-approved-by-virginia-regulators/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than two years ago</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we’ve heard nothing since, even though the enabling legislation appears to </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0580" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make it mandatory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for both Dominion and APCo. </span></p>
<h2><b>Appalachian Power</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">APCo never developed a community solar program either, and the shared solar program discussed earlier would not be available to APCO customers even if it gets off the ground. But APCo does have two renewable energy offerings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• For its </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Green Pricing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program, APCo put together wind and hydro from its own facilities. That means it’s actual energy and reasonably priced, at less than half a cent per kWh. But these are existing facilities that all its customers had been paying for until APCo figured out how to segment the market and make more money, and the hydro is old. (As with Dominion’s renewable energy program, the real purpose of the new product was to </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/10/appalachian-power-gets-approval-to-sell-100-percent-renewable-energy-to-customers-hold-the-champagne/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">close off competition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Even cheaper is </span><a href="https://www.appalachianpower.com/account/bills/programs/green-pricing/va/#frequent-questions" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative Option-REC</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the RECs for which “may come from a variety of resources but will likely be associated with energy from waste, solid waste and hydro facilities.” No biomass, anyway, but I still have trouble imagining who would pay extra for (literally) rubbish. </span></p>
<p><b style="color: #111111; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 27px;">Virginia electric coops</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span><br />
<b></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some electric cooperatives offer real renewable energy to customers, and a couple have community solar programs that are quite attractive.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://www.mycvec.com/energy-solutions/community-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Central Virginia Electric Cooperative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://www.barcelectric.com/communitySolar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BARC Electric Cooperative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offer community solar programs that not only deliver actual solar energy, but also let customers lock in a fixed price for 20-25 years. </span><a href="https://www.mycvec.com/energy-solutions/community-solar" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four other coops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also offer a solar energy option, and at least </span><a href="https://www.svec.coop/energy-solutions/community-solar-project/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one other is working on it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Many coops also sell RECs, of mixed quality. Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative offers RECs generated by </span><a href="https://www.svec.coop/energy-solutions/renewable-energy-option-rider-r/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wind farms owned or contracted by</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, the generation cooperative that supplies power to most Virginia coops. Rappahannock Electric Cooperative, however, </span><a href="https://www.myrec.coop/green-energy-certificates" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sells only biomass RECs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Bottom line: if you are a member of an electric cooperative, you may have better options than either Dominion or APCo is offering — and if you don’t, hey, you’re an owner of the coop, so make some noise!</span></p>
<h2><b>Arcadia</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you like RECs, you don’t have to buy RECs from your own utility. The folks at </span><a href="https://www.arcadia.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arcadia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have struggled for years to offer products that put new renewable energy on the grid. In states that allow community solar, Arcadia now offers wind and solar from projects in those states. Everywhere else, they just sell RECs. The website provides no information indicating where the facilities are, meaning they could be out in the same central plains states that are awash in surplus wind RECs. Their game plan appears to be for all the nice liberals in blue states to throw enough money at red state RECs that eventually the day will come when demand exceeds supply and drives the price up enough to incentivize new projects. The plan sounds self-defeating to me, but in any case, buyers should keep in mind that the RECs bought before that glorious date will have incentivized precisely nothing. </span></p>

<h2><b>Other options</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, if you have a sunny roof, you can install solar onsite and net-meter. Of all the programs available today, that’s the one that will save you money instead of making you spend more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have a sunny roof, but you’d still like to see your money put solar onto the grid, consider contributing to a church, school or non-profit that is going solar, or to an organization that puts solar on low-income homes. Two that operate in Virginia are </span><a href="https://www.whsv.com/2021/03/21/nonprofit-partners-with-habitat-for-humanity-to-place-solar-panels-on-homes/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give Solar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which puts solar on Habitat for Humanity houses, and </span><a href="https://gridalternatives.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GRID Alternatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which trains workers to install solar on low-income homes here and abroad. If everyone in Virginia who is currently buying RECs were to choose this alternative instead, it would put millions of dollars to work building new solar in Virginia, and lowering the energy bills of people who most need the help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that might make it the best option of all.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Dominion Energy will be holding its annual shareholder meeting virtually on May 5. For the most part these meetings are scripted and self-congratulatory, but they also make space for individual shareholders to ask questions. For ordinary people who may own just a small number of shares in the company, this may be the only time they get to ask CEO Bob Blue about the company’s actions.</p>
<p>The questions have to be submitted ahead of time, so no one should expect high drama, and some of the questions the general public cares about are not ones that shareholders would be expected to ask. For example, owners of a company, as beneficiaries of its profits, would not be expected to ask, “Why do you keep blocking legislation that would open up competition in Virginia?” Or, “Why do you fight against bills that would let the SCC refund to customers some of your ill-gotten gains?”</p>
<p>But there are a lot of other questions that shareholders, as well as the rest of us, should be justly curious about. Here are my top 10.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> We learned in Dominion’s Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) case last year that the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/24/the-high-cost-of-propping-up-coals-corpse/" target="_blank">Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center</a>, the coal plant it owns in Wise County, has a 10-year net present value of negative $472 million. Why isn’t Dominion retiring it immediately to save money and reduce the number of emission allowances it has to buy now that Virginia has joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In last year’s IRP, Dominion’s preferred scenario would have it keeping its gas plants open indefinitely, even past 2045, when the Virginia Clean Economy Act requires them to be closed. The refusal to plan for full compliance with the law almost certainly impacts the decisions Dominion is making today. Now that Bob Blue has taken over the reins of Dominion from former CEO Tom Farrell, has that changed, and can we expect Dominion to take actions consistent with a full phase-out of fossil fuels before 2045?</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The energy transition will require construction of tens of thousands of megawatts of solar on hundreds of thousands of acres of land across Virginia. However, community resistance to utility-scale solar farms in Virginia is growing, in large part because they look more like industrial uses than like agricultural uses. As a result, some projects are not being permitted, a costly waste of the company’s time and resources. It’s possible to combine solar with traditional agricultural uses like animal grazing, or to install native plants to support pollinators and provide wildlife habitat, both of which would increase community acceptance. Dominion installs pollinator plantings along some of its transmission line rights-of-way, so the company has experience in this area. Will Dominion begin doing this at its solar projects? If not, what is Dominion doing to “sweeten the pot” for local communities in order to secure permits?</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Dominion offers residential customers the option of a renewable energy product that includes biomass energy, a source that is not carbon-free and produces more air pollution than coal. The inclusion of biomass also makes the tariff more expensive than it would be without biomass. In contrast to this unattractive option, two years ago Dominion received SCC approval to sell solar to residential customers via a “community solar” product. This would have appealed to far more customers, but Dominion never followed through. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> With no solar option available, residents who don’t own a house with a sunny roof are currently shut out of the solar market in Dominion’s Virginia territory. In 2019 and 2020 the General Assembly considered legislation that would have allowed customers to buy renewable energy from third party providers. The bill passed the House each year but failed in a Senate committee due to Dominion’s opposition. If Dominion isn’t interested in selling solar to its customers today, why not let them buy it from others?</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> According to Dominion’s 2020 IRP, data centers make up 12 percent of Dominion’s load in Virginia, a number that has been increasing by 20 percent per year. Data center operators say they want renewable energy but have trouble getting it from Dominion. The biggest tech companies negotiate deals for solar, but smaller customers have fewer attractive options. What is Dominion doing to ensure that data centers have access to solar energy at attractive market rates?</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> A year ago Dominion canceled the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, losing the almost $3 billion already spent on the project but saving the additional $5 billion-plus it would have cost to complete the project. About the same time, Dominion sold off its entire gas transmission business, indicating it had come to see pipelines as poor investments. This makes sense since the company already gets all the gas it needs through existing pipelines, and going forward, climate policies and the increasing competitiveness of renewable energy and battery storage mean gas use will decline. But then the company contracted for 12.5 percent of the shipping capacity of the Mountain Valley Pipeline through its subsidiary Public Service Company of North Carolina, at a cost of at least $50 million per year. How can the company justify this investment? Is there an exit clause in the contract, or will shareholders suffer in the event the company is not allowed to pass this cost on to ratepayers?</p>
<p>8. Dominion is currently pursuing relicensing of its two aging nuclear reactors at North Anna, which are already beyond their 40-year design life. According to the 2020 IRP, Dominion plans to run the North Anna reactors, as well as its two reactors in Surry County, at least through 2045, the period covered by the IRP. Nuclear is a carbon-free resource, but so are wind and solar, and nuclear plants in other states are closing because they are no longer economically competitive. What will it cost Dominion to refurbish these nuclear plants to keep them in operation safely so far beyond their design life? And what will it cost the company if, in spite of refurbishing, one or more of the reactors can’t pass a safety inspection, or even suffers a major failure?</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> Millions of customers in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina are at risk from hurricanes and other weather events that can knock out power for many days at a time. Today, onsite solar-plus-storage can keep critical facilities operating and allow community centers and schools to serve local residents who have lost power, ensuring they have a place to store medicines that need refrigeration and to charge cellphones, motorized wheelchairs and other devices. If Dominion were to supply the batteries for these facilities, the company could access them for grid storage and services when they are not needed as backup power. In addition to offering a new profit center, it would relieve some of the pressure on line crews who work to restore power after a storm. When will Dominion offer this lifesaving service to its customers?</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> Electric vehicle charging will increase demand for electricity in Virginia, and it also offers an opportunity for the company to deploy vehicle-to-grid technology, making use of the batteries in buses and private vehicles to help balance the grid. Virginia’s General Assembly rejected legislation that would have allowed Dominion to own and control the batteries in school buses in Virginia, but it passed a bill to help local school districts buy electric buses. Will Dominion now support the ability of the school districts to buy electric school buses and own the batteries themselves, and work with them to implement a vehicle-to-grid program?</p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden wants a carbon-free electric grid by 2035. What does that look like in Virginia?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s General Assembly made history in 2020 by becoming the first state in the South to pass a law requiring the full decarbonization of its electric sector. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1193" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Clean Economy Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> requires our two largest utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power, to close all Virginia carbon-emitting power plants by 2045. As of 2050, the state will not issue carbon allowances to any other power plants in the commonwealth, including those owned by electric cooperatives and independent generators.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than a year later, President Joe Biden wants to move up the date for a carbon-free electric grid nationwide </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/27/fact-sheet-president-biden-takes-executive-actions-to-tackle-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad-create-jobs-and-restore-scientific-integrity-across-federal-government/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to 2035</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Biden is also targeting a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. On that, Virginia is actually more ambitious, at least on paper, since the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title67/chapter1/section67-101/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonwealth Energy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sets a goal for a net-zero economy by 2045. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the electric sector has to come first, mainly because it’s the linchpin for reductions in the rest of the economy.  Clean electricity allows for clean transportation when cars, trucks and buses are electrified, and for clean buildings when gas heating and gas appliances are replaced with electric. It’s harder to zero out emissions from industry and agriculture; we do need more time to develop cost-effective solutions for those. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news is the U.S. is already halfway to zero, according to </span><a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/publications/halfway-zero-progress-towards-carbon" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory that compared CO2 emissions from the power sector today to projections 15 years ago. But a lot of that achievement came from replacing coal with fracked gas, with energy efficiency and renewables making up the rest. From here on in, efficiency and carbon-free sources have to carry the whole load.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What would it take for Virginia to achieve a carbon-free grid just 14 years from now, half the time allowed by the VCEA? Questions fall roughly into three categories: cost, feasibility and reliability. All three will be easier to overcome if the whole country is working together towards a single goal, especially if the federal government does more than just point the way. But there’s a strong case for optimism regardless.  </span></p>
<h2><b>Cost</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost is the biggest concern in the minds of most people, but it shouldn’t be. It’s been three years since solar became the cheapest form of new power generation in Virginia, and prices continue to drop. The International Energy Administration </span><a href="https://www.iea.org/news/world-energy-outlook-2020-shows-how-the-response-to-the-covid-crisis-can-reshape-the-future-of-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year that falling prices mean solar is “becoming the new king of the world’s electricity markets,” poised to become the primary source of new electricity generation worldwide by 2030. (Did you read about the solar project in Saudi Arabia that will deliver solar at </span><a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/04/08/saudi-arabias-second-pv-tender-draws-world-record-low-bid-of-0104-kwh/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">barely over a penny per kilowatt-hour</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind has been the </span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/perspective/levelized-cost-of-energy-and-levelized-cost-of-storage-2020/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cheapest form of generation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for years in many states, and its price is still falling. Of course, for Virginia the big wind opportunity lies offshore. Offshore wind technology is still in its infancy in the U.S., making it relatively expensive, but its price trajectory is also </span><a href="https://cleanenergy.org/blog/promising-trends-emerging-for-u-s-offshore-wind/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">steeply downward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Once the industry scales up and American manufacturing, supply chain and workforce replace European imports, prices will fall further — though it may never match solar on price. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only expensive part of an all-renewables scenario right now is the challenge of keeping supply in sync with demand. But as with wind and solar, the cost of battery storage technologies has been falling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, what happens to our existing fossil fuel plants? Closing coal plants was already the right move for consumers. Virginia’s few remaining coal plants don’t run much and are </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/24/the-high-cost-of-propping-up-coals-corpse/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">money sinks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Dominion’s newest coal plant, for example, has a 10-year net present value of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">negative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $472 million. Shuttering coal plants will save money today as well as speeding us along the path to zero carbon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, we have a lot of gas plants that currently make money, so our utilities are even more loath to plan for their demise. Dominion spent most of the last decade building out a huge fleet of natural gas combined-cycle plants on the theory that fracking would make gas a cheap fuel forever. The theory ignored the growing competitiveness of wind and solar that was evident even early on in the building spree. This isn’t just hindsight talking; in 2013 I wrote that Dominion’s newly-approved 1,358-megawatt Brunswick County Power Station was destined to become </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2013/09/04/dominions-giant-concrete-paperweight/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a giant concrete paperweight</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as clean energy displaced fossil fuels. Yet a few years later Dominion added to its paperweight collection with the even larger Greensville County Power Station. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In both cases the equally short-sighted State Corporation Commission approved these investments, so bad luck, ratepayers: we are stuck paying off the capital costs whether the plants run or not. That does not mean we have to operate them; </span><a href="https://www.rethinkx.com/energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> show that by 2030 it will be cheaper to turn gas plants into solar panel factories while we run our grid on wind and sunlight. </span></p>
<h2><b>Feasibility</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A rapid transition to a carbon-free grid poses logistical challenges. We need enough suitable land to hold all that solar. (</span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/12/11/of-sheep-and-solar-fields/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agrivoltaics will help</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) The federal government needs to identify new areas of the ocean for offshore wind turbines. We also need solutions to seasonal fluctuations in demand. We need new transmission lines. We need enough lithium for batteries, steel for turbines, silicon for solar and a trained workforce, stat!  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal coordination will be key to solving many of these challenges, but we can also reduce land acquisition and transmission barriers if we don’t insist on replacing large, utility-owned fossil fuel power plants only with large, utility-owned wind and solar farms. Virginians will benefit far more if we prioritize solar and storage on rooftops, parking lots, brownfields, closed landfills and rights-of-way. That’s not just about space, but about assigning value to benefits like storm resilience, emergency preparedness and local jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the same reason, we should insist on building homes better. Houses that are well insulated need less heat in the winter and air conditioning in the summer, reducing the problem of seasonal swings in energy demand. (They are also healthier and more comfortable.)</span></p>
<h2><b>Reliability</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rapid transition to a carbon-free grid is a climate imperative, but it’s still a tall order for a utility or a regulator whose job it is to keep the lights on. Batteries, energy efficiency and demand response programs can do only so much. Planners will also have to factor in the likelihood that by 2035, many vehicles will be electric, and electricity will replace gas appliances in new buildings and retrofits. Balancing supply and demand 24/7 with just today’s tools would not be an easy job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, fortunately, they will not be working with today’s tools. The pace of change in energy and computer technology over the past 14 years will be matched or exceeded by the pace of the next 14. </span><a href="https://www.theplanetarypress.com/2020/11/green-hydrogen-choosing-natures-path/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green hydrogen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gets all the press, but hundreds of other innovations will also combine to make a zero-carbon energy supply feasible and reliable — and, not incidentally, far better for people and the planet than what we have now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, we are witnessing the launch of a new era in energy, what Tony Seba’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">RethinkX Project</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calls “the fastest, deepest, most profound disruption of the energy sector in over a century,” driven by low-cost solar, wind and battery storage (SWB).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Project’s report </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rethinking Energy 2020-2030</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> puts it this way: “The SWB disruption of energy will closely parallel the digital disruption of information technology. Just as computers and the Internet slashed the marginal cost of information and opened the door to hundreds of new business models that collectively have had a transformative impact upon the global economy, so too will SWB slash the marginal cost of electricity and create a plethora of opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship. What happened in the world of bits is now poised to happen in the world of electrons.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, a carbon-free grid by 2035? Bring it on, President Biden. Virginia is ready.</span></p>

(VCU Capital News Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most exciting areas of energy technology today is storage. With wind and solar now the leading sources of new energy capacity in the U.S., maximizing their potential in the future depends on the development of storage solutions with different durations and applications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tend to think first of batteries, a form of chemical storage, but energy can also be stored thermally (for example, in molten salt at concentrating solar facilities) or using gravity (think of hydroelectric dams and pumped storage). Compressed-air storage, flywheels, and hydrogen fuel cells all offer promise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other new technologies are a little more cutting edge, one might even say niche. Take, for example, an interesting gravity-based system designed by Dr. April Iocus, a professor of theoretical engineering and self-described tinkerer. Dr. Iocus turned her entire house itself into an energy storage system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar panels cover the roof of the modest Cape Cod. During the day, energy from the panels powers a hydraulic system to lift the house off its foundation. As the sun sets, the house gradually settles back down, in the process putting out more than enough energy to keep the HVAC, lighting and appliances all humming along without a hitch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Gravity is a free resource,” Iocus points out. “Like wind and solar, it’s available everywhere and won’t run out. It’s also really strong, so it’s ideal for holding energy and then releasing it again. It takes a tremendous amount of energy to lift a house even a little way off the ground, so even on cloudy days the system holds a lot of stored energy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home gravity storage has a number of advantages over other storage methods. Energy is stored on site so it requires no transmission lines, and there are no toxic chemicals or fire hazards, as there are with batteries. Batteries also have a limited useful life, whereas a gravity-powered system can be expected to last as long as the house does. </span></p>

        </a>
        
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iocus concedes that the design of GravityHouse<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> did pose other challenges. Indoor plumbing was one. Currently the house connects to city water and sewer only at night, when the building comes to rest on its foundation. During the day, holding tanks serve the family’s needs. Although this works perfectly well, Iocus says, “It drives the housing code people crazy. I’m working on a solution involving coiled pipes. Picture giant springs, and you get the idea. I’m ready to install them as soon as I work the kinks out, literally.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_26462" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-scaled.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-26462" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-300x300.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-150x150.jpg 150w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-768x768.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-2048x2048.jpg 2048w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-696x696.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-1068x1068.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gravityhouse-420x420.jpg 420w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A plan for April Iocus&#8217; &#8220;gravity house.&#8221; (Ivy Main/ Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ingress and egress posed another problem initially. On a clear, sunny day in June, the house may rise as much as 12</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> feet off the ground by late afternoon. The solution: purpose-built staircases by the front and back doors offer landings every couple of feet. From the right landing it is just a modest step up or down to reach the level of the door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iocus also recounts one near-catastrophe. The hydraulic system was not designed with a stop at the top. One June day a solar flare increased the surplus electricity coming out of the solar panels so much that it lifted the house clear off the hoist. The house hovered in the air a full minute while Iocus frantically cranked the air conditioning to maximum output. Gradually, the house settled back onto the hoist—fortunately, without even a millimeter shift in position. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was just lucky. If there had been even a breath of wind, or if I had so much as sneezed, well. . . .” Iocus has since installed a stop to make sure the same thing can’t happen again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the success of GravityHouse<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, Iocus is turning her attention to other projects. She is particularly excited about potential new uses for the enormous natural gas transmission pipelines that stand to be abandoned as Americans stop using fossil fuels. Iocus says larger-diameter pipelines could be repurposed for human transportation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got pipeline infrastructure and compressor stations already in place all over the country,” she notes. “And a 42-inch pipeline is big enough for a human to sit comfortably in a transport pod. It’s an obvious solution.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iocus is currently in talks with Elon Musk to secure financing. </span></p>
<p>Happy April 1.</p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the start of the 2021 legislative session, I highlighted three areas where Virginia needed to make significant progress to support its climate agenda: transportation electrification, improving the energy efficiency of buildings and giving consumers greater access to renewable energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly delivered on one-and-a-half out of three. If we add bonus points for smaller successes, maybe we can call it a total of two. The transportation category truly outperformed expectations, but building efficiency underperformed and renewable energy access didn’t perform at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the transportation sector, the General Assembly passed the Clean Car Standards requiring manufacturers to deliver more electric vehicles to Virginia dealers (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1965" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1965</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">; approved a statewide study of transit equity (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hj542" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ542</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">); approved (but so far has not funded) an electric vehicle rebate program (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1979" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1979</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">); directed the SCC to report on ways to electrify transportation (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2282" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2282</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">); and established a school bus electrification fund (also empty for now)(</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2118" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2118</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together these bills address two of the most significant ways we can reduce emissions from the transportation sector: supporting the move away from the internal combustion engine to electric vehicles and improving mass transit options. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2021/03/02/we-voted-no-how-an-electric-school-bus-bill-became-one-of-the-biggest-battles-of-the-session/?utm_source=Energy+News+Network+daily+email+digests&amp;utm_campaign=95448a5db6-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_05_11_11_39_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_724b1f01f5-95448a5db6-89282651" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House rejected</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a second school bus electrification bill that, as originally drafted, would have allowed Dominion Energy Virginia to own, control and profit handsomely from the batteries in as many as 1,250 new electric school buses. Adding non-polluting school buses across Virginia and testing the value of vehicle-to-grid technology would have been exciting, but Dominion couldn’t help taking a good idea and trying to make it into another bloated profit center. Given the odor of Dominion boondoggle, the question isn’t why the House rejected the bill, but why the Senate was willing to swallow it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, it’s clear electric school buses are an idea whose time has come, and vehicle-to-grid technology could have real benefits for ratepayers. Dominion is already testing the technology with school bus batteries in a smaller pilot program, so we can expect to see more on this topic next year. Meanwhile, advocates hope to see funding emerge to implement HB2118, possibly from the federal stimulus bill now under consideration in Congress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving the energy efficiency of new homes should have been an equally popular idea with legislators. Virginia will be spending hundreds of millions of dollars retrofitting existing homes in the years to come, so it makes sense to ensure that new houses don’t immediately join the queue of homes needing upgrades to be climate-ready. Unfortunately, beefing up the energy efficiency provisions of Virginia’s residential building code (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2227" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2227</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proved a hard sell in the face of entrenched opposition from the homebuilders’ lobby and surprising resistance from even some Democratic legislators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation originally would have mandated adoption of the latest national energy efficiency code provisions, but it was amended to leave it up to the discretion of the code-writing board whether to require new homes to achieve this higher level of efficiency. They already had that authority; however, the board will now have to consider factors that favor stricter standards, like the long-term cost of ownership. For that reason I’m counting this bill as half a win. Whether or not the board decides to take the hint, improving efficiency in new homes is a topic we will see a lot more of in the future — and next time it is likely to come with more urgency and added features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy efficiency bills did better when they addressed only government bodies. Legislation that passed now favors energy-efficient and water-efficient products in public procurement, and requires EV charging and energy/carbon tracking capability for new public buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, 2021 was another bad year for my third priority, giving consumers the right to buy renewable energy from competitive suppliers. The House supported the “right to shop” bill (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB2048" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2048</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but Senate Commerce and Labor once again proved itself a bulwark of defense for the monopoly utility model against the interests of residents and corporate customers alike. Killing the bill does nothing to lessen the demand from consumers. If Dominion does not move soon to offer better renewable energy options itself, we can expect to see this legislation return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate Commerce and Labor further cemented its reputation as Dominion’s best friend by dispatching the full suite of utility reform bills that had won bipartisan support in the House. Only three senators on the 15-member committee consistently voted in favor of the reforms, ensuring that none of them got to the Senate floor. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Various other bills advanced the energy transition in smaller, focused bites. But perhaps the best news is that nothing this year marked a retreat from the commitment the General Assembly and the governor made last year to move Virginia toward a cleaner and more equitable energy supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is a brief round-up of the climate and energy bills that passed this year, including the ones mentioned above. The governor will still have to sign the bills before they become law, but we are not expecting any surprises. </span></p>
<h2><b>Renewable energy and storage</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1925" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB1925</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kilgore) establishes, but does not fund, the Virginia Brownfield and Coal Mine Renewable Energy Grant Fund and Program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1994" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1994</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Murphy) expands the definition of small agriculture generators to include certain small manufacturing businesses such as breweries, distilleries and wineries for the purposes of the law allowing these businesses to aggregate meters and sell renewable energy to a utility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2006" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2006</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Heretick) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1201" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1201</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Petersen) change the definition of an “electric supplier” to include the operator of a storage facility of at least 25 MW, exempting them from state and local taxation but allowing a revenue share assessment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2034" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB2034</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Hurst) clarifies that the program allowing third-party power purchase agreements (PPAs) applies to nonjurisdictional customers (i.e., local government and schools) as well as jurisdictional customers (most other customers) of Appalachian Power and Kentucky Utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2148" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB2148</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Willett) provides for energy storage facilities below 150 MW to be subject to the DEQ permit by rule process as “small renewable energy projects.” This is a priority bill for renewable energy industry associations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2201" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB2201</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Jones) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1207" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1207</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Barker) expands provisions related to siting agreements for solar projects located in an opportunity zone to include energy storage projects; however, according to existing language, the provision only takes effect if the GA also passes legislation authorizing localities to adopt an ordinance providing for the tax treatment of energy storage projects. This is another renewable energy industry bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2269" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB2269</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Heretick) provides for increases in the revenue share localities can require for solar projects based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1258" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1258</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Marsden) requires the State Water Control Board to administer a Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Program (VESCP) on behalf of any locality that notifies the Department of Environmental Quality that it has chosen not to administer a VESCP for any solar photovoltaic (electric energy) project with a rated electrical generation capacity exceeding five megawatts. The provisions become effective only if the program is funded; Marsden has submitted a budget amendment. This is also a priority bill for renewable energy industry associations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=212&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1295" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1295</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DeSteph) requires utilities to use Virginia-made or U.S.-made products in constructing renewable energy and storage facilities “if available.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As amended, the products must be “reasonably available and competitively priced.” </span></i></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is never fun to see our fellow Americans suffer, whether it’s from pandemic diseases or weather disasters. Our hearts go out to the residents of Texas who suffered without electricity and heat for days, some of them also without safe drinking water, and a few of them even dying from exposure, fires or carbon monoxide poisoning as they tried to keep warm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, picking apart the preposterous excuses from Texas leaders seeking to avoid responsibility for the fully preventable power outages and the misery that accompanied them — well, that’s another matter. And it’s made so much easier by those leaders’ insistence on trying to score political points instead of admitting that at least some of the blame rests on their shoulders. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who went on Fox News to blame liberals for the debacle. Ignoring the failure of his state, which hasn&#8217;t elected a Democrat to statewide office <a href="https://www.ksat.com/vote-2020/2020/11/06/has-texas-ever-turned-blue/" target="_blank">since 1994</a>, to plan for climate change and invest in power grid winterization, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ndrew_lawrence/status/1361866553998909442?s=20" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he told talk show host Sean Hannity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the problem was actually the portion of the state’s electricity supply that comes from wind and solar. “This shows how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal for the United States of America. Our wind and our solar got shut down, and they were collectively more than 10 percent of our power grid, and that thrust Texas into a situation where it was lacking power on a statewide basis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one in Abbott’s echo chamber pointed out that a) solar actually </span><a href="https://www.pv-tech.org/how-texas-solar-helped-meet-winter-storm-challenges-and-could-go-even-further/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">did just fine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, b) states like </span><a href="https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Iowa-clean-energy-factsheet.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://cleanpower.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/South-Dakota-clean-energy-factsheet.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Dakota</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with much worse winter weather, rely much more heavily on wind power than Texas does, yet there are no stories about their turbines seizing up and their grids collapsing, and c) if a shortage of 10 percent shuts your grid down, you have way more problems than you can blame on the Green New Deal. Also, Abbott&#8217;s claim elides the inconvenient fact that the biggest factor in the grid failure was some 28,000 megawatts of coal, nuclear and gas power that went offline, <a href="http://www.ercot.com/news/releases/show/225369" target="_blank">as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas reported</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, former Gov. Rick Perry preferred swaggering to problem-solving, </span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/539241-rick-perry-texans-would-be-without-electricity-for-longer-to-keep" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">saying in a blog post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Texans would be without electricity for longer than three days to keep the federal government out of their business.” This seems to have been written at about the same time Governor Abbott was </span><a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/local/2021/02/13/abbott-asks-federal-aid-warns-texans-stay-home-conserve-power/4477397001/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asking the federal government for disaster relief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then there was Ted Cruz. I’m not referring to the farce of his skipping out on the post-storm misery to fly to Cancun, then pinning it on his daughters before high-tailing it home to make a show of handing out relief supplies. That incident just reminds us that no matter how deep our divisions, Americans can always find unity in our collective loathing of Ted Cruz.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, in this case I want to point to a pair of tweets from Cruz, almost exactly two years apart. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/RandallUhrig/status/1363601751035756546/photo/1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feb. 13, 2019</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Success of TX energy is no accident: it was built over many years on principles of free enterprise &amp; low regulation w more jobs &amp; opportunities as the constant goal. We work to export this recipe for success t more &amp; more states so that all Americans enjoy the same prosperity.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And here he is on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1363529410268319747" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feb. 22</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of this year, reacting to news that free enterprise and low regulation had produced $5,000 electric bills for some customers in the aftermath of the storm: “This is WRONG. No power company should get a windfall because of a natural disaster, and Texans shouldn’t get hammered by ridiculous rate increases for last week’s energy debacle. State and local regulators should act swiftly to prevent this injustice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily for us, lots of other people have been more interested in understanding what happened and preventing it from happening again than in trying to duck blame and score political points. The real story, it turns out, is simple at its core: “Low regulation” meant the Texas grid and power providers did not adequately prepare for winter storms that climate change <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/17/global-warming-record-cold-intense-storms-tornadoes/6780433002/" target="_blank">might be making worse</a> than they used to be. And because the Texas grid is cut off from the rest of the country, (a feature, not a bug, to cowboy politicians) when the crisis hit there was no way to import power from other states that were better prepared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s take a closer look at what went wrong, how it could have been avoided and what lessons it offers for the rest of us. </span></p>
<h2><b>The setup: an isolated grid with &#8216;free enterprise and low regulation&#8217;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grid that serves Texas is uniquely isolated, which also gives it a unique vulnerability. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas serves most of the state, and no other states. Texans are proud of that (or were before this month), because it means there is no role for federal regulators like FERC. It also means that when power ran out, ERCOT couldn’t just import it from parts of the country with a surplus. Of course, states near Texas also suffered in the storm, so there may not have been a lot of surplus power to be had. It is worth noting, though, that the border city of El Paso fared better than the rest of Texas because it is not part of ERCOT but part of a larger regional transmission organization serving several southwestern states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another feature of ERCOT is the low regulation that Ted Cruz celebrated. ERCOT keeps it simple for power generators. They get paid for the power they produce. Other RTOs have what is called a “capacity market” to reward generating plants just for being available to run when called on; ERCOT does not. As a result, generators have no incentive to guarantee their facilities will be capable of generating when most needed. Nor are they otherwise required to winterize their infrastructure to keep it operating in the case of very cold weather. That would be a normal cost of doing business for a power provider in a northern state, but Texas winters are usually warm enough not to require it. If you won’t be penalized for not winterizing, you have little incentive to do it when you’re competing on cost with other power sellers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of a capacity market means ERCOT doesn’t have a lot of surplus generation to call on when demand spikes, as it did this month. A power provider that is only paid for power actually produced has no incentive to build or maintain a less competitive generating plant that can only make money when prices go high enough. As a result, ERCOT has the lowest amount of reserve capacity of any RTO, at about 10 percent. (The RTO that serves Virginia and parts of a dozen other states, PJM Interconnection, has a much-higher-than-average reserve margin of 30 percent.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ordinarily, a small reserve wouldn’t be a problem for Texas in winter, because demand for power in ERCOT is higher in summer, with air conditioners running, than it is in Texas’ typically mild winters. But in cold weather, gas-fired power plants face competition for fuel, when some of the gas supply goes for heating buildings. This month, when gas wells and pipelines also froze up, there simply wasn’t enough fuel to go around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last important feature of the Texas system is retail competition. Electricity customers in ERCOT can choose among dozens of power providers. Some providers keep rates constant; others offer a variable rate that just passes through the wholesale cost of power, with only a small monthly fee added. When wholesale rates are low, the consumer saves money on a plan like that. But regulators didn’t insist on any safeguard to protect customers against the possibility of wholesale prices spiking to astronomical levels due to a power shortage. That’s exactly what happened in the aftermath of this month’s storm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That $5,000 power bill Cruz criticized? That’s unfettered free-market supply-and-demand at work. </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/20/us/texas-storm-electric-bills.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a feature, not a bug</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you don’t like that feature, Senator Cruz, maybe low regulation isn’t for you. Helping consumers avoid power bills in the thousands of dollars would have been easy, but it would have required a little bit of regulation. </span></p>
<h2><b>The storm: Nature takes no interest in political posturing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well before this storm hit, ERCOT was fully aware of the vulnerabilities of its particular brand of laissez-faire operations. Ten years ago, in the wake of another winter storm, </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/21/us/texas-electricity-ercot-blackouts.html?utm_source=Energy+News+Network+daily+email+digests&amp;utm_campaign=9a42a20f01-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_05_11_11_46_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_724b1f01f5-9a42a20f01-89282651" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas operators were warned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the dire consequences that could ensue if they did not require generators to winterize operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, they didn’t, and this chart from the U.S. Energy Information Agency shows what happened to generation as a result.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_25779" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:600px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/chart_-ivy.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-25779" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/chart_-ivy.png" alt="" width="600" height="291" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/chart_-ivy.png 600w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/chart_-ivy-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  (U.S. Energy Information Agency)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Before the storm, you can see natural gas and coal plants running less when high winds produce plenty of cheaper wind power, then cranking up when wind speeds drop. As the week goes on, power supply from natural gas plants increases to meet higher demand from colder weather, while other generation holds steady. Then suddenly you see every category of energy resource except solar drop in output, as critical components of some generating units freeze up and the units fall offline, while fuel supplies also dwindle. Some wind generation falls off, but so does coal, nuclear and (especially) natural gas, just as they are all needed most.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storm was, to be sure, one of the worst winter storms ERCOT had ever faced. And the situation could have been worse. If operators had not proactively cut power to customers, demand in excess of supply </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/21/us/texas-electricity-ercot-blackouts.html?utm_source=Energy+News+Network+daily+email+digests&amp;utm_campaign=9a42a20f01-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_05_11_11_46_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_724b1f01f5-9a42a20f01-89282651" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would have damaged grid infrastructure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so severely that large swaths of the population would have been without power for weeks or months. (Let us now praise faceless bureaucrats, for they just saved Texas.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it was bad, and could have been worse. Why didn’t Texas prepare for it, even after being warned? I have one theory. People who cling to simplistic notions that global warming “should” produce only warmer winters have a tiresome habit of pointing to cold weather as evidence that climate change isn’t real, but I think they also take secret comfort in the idea that if the planet is warming, extreme cold weather events will become less common, with less need to prepare for them. If your political philosophy requires you to see regulation as an evil, your own willful misunderstanding of climate science might provide all the excuse you’re looking for not to act. </span></p>
<h2><b>Could it happen here? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bad weather can happen anywhere, and it’s always safer not to gloat. That said, several features distinguish ERCOT from PJM, and Texas from Virginia. As noted before, PJM has a capacity market that rewards even otherwise-uneconomic generators for hanging around being ready to produce at short notice. Indeed, PJM is so oversupplied that consumers are paying higher prices for the inefficiency, but it does protect us from the kind of power shortage and price spikes that Texans experienced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, though not other states in PJM, also features monopoly power companies rather than retail choice. There is plenty of disagreement as to whether that is good or bad for consumers. The monopoly model requires strong regulation to ensure captive consumers aren’t being overcharged, and are being offered the products they want. Critics (and I’m among them) have argued that Virginia isn’t doing enough on this front. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand, the retail choice model depends on consumers being well informed, and also requires regulators to scrutinize the tactics of power providers and punish the ones who take advantage of unwary consumers. So, ironically, a deregulated electricity market requires strong regulation to protect participants. Strong regulation could have prevented Texas providers from offering residential customers a tariff based on wholesale prices, with risks that residents couldn’t easily understand or mitigate against.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Texas was also more vulnerable to disruption because power generators were neither required nor incentivized to winterize their plants. Sure, a winterized plant would have turned a hefty profit in this storm, but in a more average winter, the extra cost would not have paid off. The option not to winterize isn’t a good one in PJM. As a result, when the power does go out in PJM, the problem is inevitably in the delivery infrastructure, not the generation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s system of vertically-integrated utilities means our utilities own their electric generation as well as the power lines. They can charge customers for building and maintaining those generating facilities, so they have less incentive to skimp on weatherization. That increases the reliability of those facilities. But even if several power plants in Virginia were to fail all at once, we could still draw power from more than 1,200 facilities across PJM, or even from the larger Eastern Interconnection. By design, Texas does not have that option.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One distinction between ERCOT and PJM that doesn’t make a difference, in spite of Gov. Abbott’s claims, is the greater percentage of wind in ERCOT than in PJM. Wind actually </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/how-much-power-texas-renewable-coal-gas-wind-turbines-1570238" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">makes up 23 percent of generation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in ERCOT, more than perhaps Abbott wanted to admit, given that most of it came online under his watch. In PJM, wind makes up only </span><a href="https://services.pjm.com/annualreport2019/innovation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 3 percent.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If Abbott were correct that wind turbines can’t handle winter weather, that would be a reason for more northern grids like PJM to avoid wind. But of course, Abbott’s claim is political wishful thinking divorced from reality. Wind turbines operate just fine in the much colder winters of Iowa, the Dakotas, Canada—heck, even in the frigid and stormy North Sea, where offshore wind </span><a href="https://ocean-energyresources.com/2020/04/03/winter-2019-2020-offshore-wind-energy-in-belgian-north-sea-breaks-record/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ramps up production in winter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for solar, you could see from the chart that it was not affected by the cold weather. Texas residents who were lucky enough to have both rooftop solar and batteries spent the aftermath of the storm </span><a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-saves-owners-texas-winter-power-outage/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bragging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about never losing power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the wake of this month’s storm, the independent Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) analyzed what went wrong and issued recommendations for Texas grid operators. Among the </span><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2021/02/19/as-texas-recovers-report-warns-grid-operators-to-plan-better-for-extreme-weather/?utm_source=pv+magazine+USA&amp;utm_campaign=39bbb6faf6-RSS_EMAIL_CAMPAIGN&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_80e0d17bb8-39bbb6faf6-159072305" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unsurprising recommendations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: ERCOT should do better planning for resource adequacy and increase its interconnections to other power systems so it does not have to go it alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would add one more recommendation: Keep politics out of it. You can’t deliver reliable power that is also reasonably priced without robust regulation. If leaders refuse to learn from this winter, they’ll simply set up Mother Nature for another opportunity to mess with Texas.   </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is, famously, a state that prides itself on being business-friendly. That makes it all the more interesting that a number of bills favoring consumers have made it through the House. Democrats have led the charge, but several of the bills earned bipartisan support even in the face of utility opposition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This doesn’t guarantee their luck will hold. Democrats aren’t just more numerous in the House, they are also younger and more independent-minded than the old guard Democrats in control of the Senate. The second half of the session is going to be a lot more challenging for pro-consumer legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The action will be especially hot in the coming days around five bills dealing with utility reform and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/?p=25309&amp;preview=true" target="_blank">a customer’s “right to shop</a>” for renewable energy (HB2048). All these bills passed the House with at least some Republican support. But they are headed to Senate Commerce and Labor, which, though dominated by Democrats, has a long history of protecting utilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Clean Car Standard (HB1965), which would make electric cars more readily available in Virginia, and the EV rebate bill (HB1979), which would make them more affordable, seem to be on stronger ground as far as Democratic support goes — and they will need all the Democrats because Republicans are united in opposition. But rebates require money, and that is always a challenge. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is the status of the bills I’ve been following. Since we have passed “crossover,” House bills will be heard in the Senate and vice-versa. At the end I’ve collected the bills that died along the way. </span></p>
<h1><b>BILLS ALIVE AT HALFTIME</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bills are arranged by category, and then by number, with House bills first. </span></p>
<h2><b>Renewable energy and storage</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB1925" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1925</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kilgore) establishes, but does not fund, the Virginia Brownfield and Coal Mine Renewable Energy Grant Fund and Program. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the House unanimously, expected to pass in the Senate.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB1994" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">  HB1994</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Murphy) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB2215" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2215 </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Runion) expands the definition of small agriculture generators to include certain small manufacturing businesses such as breweries, distilleries and wineries for the purposes of the law allowing these businesses to aggregate meters and sell renewable energy to a utility. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2215 was incorporated into HB1994, which passed the House 93-6. I expect it to pass the Senate.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2006&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2006</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Heretick) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1201" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1201</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Petersen) change the definition of an “electric supplier” to include the operator of a storage facility of at least 25 MW, exempting them from state and local taxation but allowing a revenue share assessment. This is a priority bill for renewable energy industry associations. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2006 passed the House 11-8 with one abstention. SB1201 passed the Senate 38-0-1. Looks like this one is a done deal.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB2034" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2034</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Hurst) clarifies that the program allowing third-party power purchase agreements (PPAs) applies to nonjurisdictional customers (i.e., local government and schools) as well as jurisdictional customers (most other customers). </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the House 99-0</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate companion bill</span></i> <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1420" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1420</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Edwards) also passed unanimously, so this is another done deal.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB2048" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2048</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Bourne) restores the right of customers to buy renewable energy from any supplier even once their own utility offers a renewable energy purchase option. In addition, third party suppliers of renewable energy are required to offer a discounted renewable energy product to low-income customers, saving them at least 10% off the cost of regular utility service. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the House 67-32, which is darned good for a pro-consumer, pro renewable energy bill. But a similar bill ran into trouble in Senate Commerce and Labor in past years due to utility opposition. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•  </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB2148" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2148</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Willett) provides for energy storage facilities below 150 MW to be subject to the DEQ permit by rule process as “small renewable energy projects.” This is a priority bill for renewable energy industry associations. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the House 89-9.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB2201" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB2201</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Jones) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1207" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1207</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  (Barker) expands provisions related to siting agreements for solar projects located in an opportunity zone to include energy storage projects; however, according to existing language, the provision only takes effect if the GA also passes legislation authorizing localities to adopt an ordinance providing for the tax treatment of energy storage projects. (Why doesn’t the bill just go ahead and include that authorization? Don’t ask me.) This is another renewable energy industry bill. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2201 passed the House 71-29. SB1207</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">passed the Senate 37-0. Another done deal. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB2269" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB2269</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Heretick) provides for increases in the revenue share localities can require for solar projects based on changes in the Consumer Price Index. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the House 91-8. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1258" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB1258</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Marsden) requires the State Water Control Board to administer a Virginia Erosion and Sediment Control Program (VESCP) on behalf of any locality that notifies the Department of Environmental Quality that it has chosen not to administer a VESCP for any solar photovoltaic (electric energy) project with a rated electrical generation capacity exceeding five megawatts. The provisions become effective only if the program is funded; Marsden has submitted a budget amendment. This is also a priority bill for renewable energy industry associations. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the Senate 39-0.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1295" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1295</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (DeSteph) requires utilities to use Virginia-made or U.S.-made products in constructing renewable energy and storage facilities “if available.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">After much criticism it was amended to read that the products must be “reasonably available and competitively priced,” after which the now-happily-pointless bill passed the Senate 37-0-2.</span></i></p>
<h2><b>Energy efficiency and buildings</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb1811" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1811</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Helmer) adds a preference for energy efficient products in public procurement. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the House 55-44 along party lines. Someone will have to explain to me why wasting taxpayer dollars on products that cost more to operate is a conservative value. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1859&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1859</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Guy) amends last year’s legislation on Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) loans to allow these loans to be extended to projects completed in the previous two years; it also expressly excludes residential buildings of less than five units and residential condominiums. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed House 61-38; passed Senate 26-12-1. A done deal. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2001" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2001</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Helmer) requires state and local government buildings to be constructed or renovated to include electric vehicle charging infrastructure and the capability of tracking energy efficiency and carbon emissions. Local governments are authorized to adopt even more stringent requirements. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the House 53-45. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB2227" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2227</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kory) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb1224" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1224</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Boysko) originally required the Board of Housing and Community Development to adopt amendments to the Uniform Statewide Building Code within one year of publication of a new version of the International Code Council&#8217;s International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) to address changes related to energy efficiency and conservation. The bill would have required the Board to adopt Building Code standards that are at least as stringent as those contained in the new version of the IECC. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It turns out the homebuilders who oppose higher efficiency standards have more clout with committee chairs David Bulova in the House and George Barker in the Senate than consumer and environmental advocates do. The Senate bill never even got a hearing in committee. After much negotiation, the amended House bill now merely requires the Housing Board to “consider” adopting amendments “at least as stringent as those contained” in the latest IECC, and must “assess the public health, safety, and welfare benefits” involved, “including potential energy savings and air quality benefits over time compared to the cost of initial construction.” Republicans still wouldn’t vote for it, so it passed the House only on a party-line vote of 55-45. </span></i></p>
<h2><b>Financing</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB1919" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB1919</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kory) authorizes a locality to establish a green bank to finance clean energy investments. Fairfax County has requested this authority. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the House 55-43 on another party-line vote.  </span></i></p>
<h2><b>Fossil fuels </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB1834" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB1834</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Subramanyam) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1247" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1247</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Deeds) originally required owners of carbon-emitting power plants to conduct a study at least every 18 months to determine whether the facility should be retired; and to give notice of any decision to retire a facility to state and local leaders within 14 days. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both bills were amended so that the retirement analysis is now just a part of the integrated resource planning process of investor-owned utilities, currently every three years, leaving out other plant owners like ODEC.  The amended bills both passed their chambers unanimously.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+HB1899" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HB1899</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Hudson) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1252" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1252</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (McPike) sunset the coal tax credits, because it is absolutely crazy that Virginia continues to subsidize coal mining. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amended to give the coal companies one more year of subsidies before the program ends Jan. 1, 2022. Passed the House 54-45 and Senate 22-17.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1265" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB1265</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Deeds) makes it easier for DEQ to inspect and issue stop-work orders during gas pipeline construction. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">An amendment slightly weakened the bill before it passed the Senate 38-0. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1311" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB1311</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (McClellan) originally required DEQ to revise erosion and sediment control plans or stormwater management plans when a stop work order has been issued for violations related to pipeline construction. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill has been amended significantly and the stop-work language removed. It does require pipeline applicants to submit detailed erosion and sediment control plans, and expands the applicability of the requirement to areas with slopes with a grade above 10 percent, a number that is currently 15 percent.

<h2><b>Climate bills </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=211&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb2330&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB2330</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Kory) is the legislation the SCC asked for to provide guidance on the Percentage of Income Payment Program under the Virginia Clean Economy Act. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This turned out to be harder than one would have thought for a bill that was just supposed to help implement a section of a previous year’s bill, and it may still be subject to further changes.</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the House 54-46, the usual party-line split.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">•</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1282" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SB1282</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Morrissey) directs DEQ to conduct a statewide greenhouse gas inventory, to be updated and published every four years. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the Senate 22-16. (It picked up one Republican vote: Jill Vogel.)</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1284" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB1284</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Favola) changes the name of the Commonwealth Energy Policy to the Commonwealth Clean Energy Policy, and streamlines the language without making major changes to the policies set out last year in Favola’s successful SB94. That bill overhauled the CEP, which until then had been a jumble of competing priorities, and established new targets for Virginia to achieve 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040 and net-zero carbon economy-wide by 2045. This year’s bill shows the Northam administration is now fully on board, and the result is a policy statement that is more concise and coherent. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amendments make the bill slightly more friendly to biomass and natural gas than the introduced bill had been, but it remains an improvement on existing law. Senator Norment, who opposed last year’s bill as well as this year’s, tried to run out the clock on it by getting it referred to Finance after it was reported from Commerce and Labor, but Finance promptly reported it, and it passed the Senate 21-18. It should have no trouble in the House.</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">• SB1374</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Lewis) would set up a Carbon Sequestration Task Force to consider methods of increasing carbon sequestration in the natural environment, establish benchmarks and identify carbon markets. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passed the Senate 38-0.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<h2><b>Utility reform</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House bills are doing great, but the one Senate bill (SB1292, see “Dead and buried”) went down in flames in Commerce and Labor with only three yea votes from Senators Deeds, Mason and Bell. The five House bills are now headed to that same tough committee. If any survive, it is likely to be the Hudson and/or Helmer bills, which are the least prescriptive. Judging from the comments made during the debate of the one Senate bill, I don’t see how the other three make it through the committee.</span></p>

But like last year, it never even got a hearing, in part because it rocked too many boats, and in part because it was a lousy bill.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year Virginia’s General Assembly passed </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2020/03/16/it-was-a-messy-chaotic-general-assembly-session-it-also-worked-out-pretty-well/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 30 separate clean energy bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which together put Virginia on a path to zero-carbon electricity by 2050, enabled massive investments in renewable energy, storage and energy efficiency and eased restrictions on distributed solar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But many of the bills that passed were not perfect, and most of the new mandates affect only the electric sector. Only about a quarter of Virginia’s greenhouse gas emissions comes from power plants, so getting serious about a zero carbon economy means finding ways to reduce emissions from transportation, buildings, industry and agriculture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, building on last year’s progress will be hard this winter, not because there aren’t plenty of opportunities, but because the legislative session that starts Jan. 13 is likely to be exceptionally short and tightly-controlled. If, as expected, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/virginia-house-plans-to-hold-2021-session-virtually/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans force a 30-day session limit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (including weekends and holidays), that means each chamber must dispose of its own bills even faster than that to meet the crossover deadline (around Jan. 28, I’m told), when bills that have passed one chamber “cross over” to be considered in the other. Leadership has responded by strictly limiting the number of bills a legislator can carry, hoping not to overwhelm the committees that have to vet the bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One result is that complex bills haven’t got a prayer. Climate advocates and their legislative champions will be focused on bills that are narrowly-crafted (or at least short) and easy to explain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to the challenge, for those who want to weigh in with their legislators, is the fact that very few bills appear in the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+lst+ALL" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislative Information System</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> yet, in another departure from prior years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then of course, there’s COVID-19, disrupting normal procedures and making it harder than ever for citizens to make their voices heard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So yeah, ain’t we got fun?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What follows is a list of bills that are far along in the drafting process, have a patron, and are likely to be filed this year. I’m omitting other initiatives that don’t seem likely to make it into legislation this year or that I don’t have enough information to go on. I have not seen the language for any of these bills, so descriptions are based on previous years’ legislation, information from legislators and advocates, or both.</span></p>

<h2><b>Building codes</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most cost-effective ways to lower carbon emissions from buildings is by constructing them with an eye to saving energy right from the start. If the builder puts more insulation in the walls and attic, reduces draftiness and installs better windows, buyers will save money and future residents will have lower heating and cooling costs for decades. Any small increases in a buyer’s mortgage costs are recouped many times over in utility bill savings.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A national standard for energy efficiency in residential buildings even takes the guesswork out. The standard, known as the International Energy Efficiency Code (IECC), is updated every three years by a national organization referenced in the law setting out procedures for adopting Virginia’s residential building code. Unfortunately, the Board of Housing and Community Development (BHCD) has long ignored its statutory obligation to keep Virginia’s building code at least consistent with these nationally recognized standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of that, and BHCD&#8217;s slow review process, Virginia&#8217;s building code is </span><a href="https://richmond.com/opinion/columnists/william-penniman-column-building-code-updates-are-needed-to-protect-virginians/article_5df595fb-a258-5477-93a1-e244c14823ed.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">still behind</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the 2012-2018 IECC&#8217;s consumer protections.  Unless BHCD is compelled to protect residents consistent with national standards, sub-standard housing will continue to be built for years into the future.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, the attorney general or the governor would direct BHCD to correct its latest decision to extend substandard code protections. Regardless, this long history of our building code underperforming national standards calls for legislative action. Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected to introduce legislation that would require the BHCD to adopt the latest IECC within 12 months.  </span></p>
<h2><b>Right to buy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a strange paradox. The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB851&amp;201+sum+SB851" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Clean Economy Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/category/energyenvironment/virginias-clean-energy-transition/" target="_blank">most ambitious clean energy laws</a> in the U.S., calling on our utilities to add thousands of megawatts of solar and wind energy in the coming years. And yet most Virginia customers still can’t buy solar energy unless they install it on their own property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an absurd position for Virginia to be in today, insisting on an energy transition but not allowing customers to actually go buy electricity from solar. Indeed, this restriction threatens Virginia’s ability to meet its carbon reduction goals, for one reason in particular: data centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers are energy hogs, and this sector has grown so fast in Virginia it now makes up 12 percent of Dominion Energy’s total electric demand in the state. Most data center operators say they want to run on renewable energy, and we need them to make good on that. Otherwise, cutting carbon will be harder and more expensive for the rest of us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we have to make it possible for them to do so. Right now, only the really big companies, like Microsoft or Facebook, can get Dominion to come to the table on solar deals. The rest don’t have that kind of market power. Neither, of course, do residential customers and small businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year saw the passage of a </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB868&amp;201+sum+HB868" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> patroned by Del. Jeffrey Bourne, D-Richmond, that would give customers the right to go outside their utility to buy renewable energy. But there was a catch: an amendment tacked on at the last moment made the bill effective only if passed again in 2021. Well, folks, now it’s 2021, and time to pass the bill again. </span></p>

<h2><b>Solar for public schools and other government buildings</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year the VCEA and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1188" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar Freedom legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanded the ability of customers to finance onsite solar projects by raising the cap on third-party power purchase agreements (PPAs) and making the program available to a wider range of customers in Appalachian Power territory, where it had previously been restricted. The new limits in Dominion territory are 500 MW for “non-jurisdictional” customers like local governments and schools and 500 MW for “jurisdictional” customers like residents and businesses; in Appalachian Power territory the new limit is 40 MW for all customers. This year a bill from Sen. John Edwards, D-Roanoke, clarifies that the program in Appalachian Power territory applies to non-jurisdictional customers as well as jurisdictional customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also expands a pilot program for </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-585.1:8/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">municipal net metering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> established in 2019 that allowed a local government to use surplus electricity generated by solar panels on one building for another building also owned by the locality. As originally enacted, however, the pilot program did not allow the locality to use PPA financing for its solar panels, a restriction that prevents budget-conscious local governments from using the program. Senator Edwards’ bill will let local governments of both Dominion and APCo use PPAs for solar projects installed under the pilot program. In addition, the previous caps on the municipal net metering pilot program are removed in favor of the general PPA program caps. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_10226" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/interstate-64-3.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10226" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/interstate-64-3.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/interstate-64-3.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/interstate-64-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/interstate-64-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/interstate-64-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/interstate-64-3-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/interstate-64-3-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/interstate-64-3-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Interstate 64 outside of Waynesboro. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<h2><b>Transportation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What RGGI does for the electric sector, the Transportation Climate Initiative (TCI) is supposed to do for transportation. As Sarah Vogelsong </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/12/22/virginia-isnt-quite-ready-to-put-a-ring-on-the-transportation-and-climate-initiative/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week, Virginia is participating in the development of the multistate compact designed to lower carbon emissions from the transportation sector 30 percent by 2032, but it hasn’t yet pledged to join the compact. There may be some details to work out before that happens, including resolving concerns from environmental justice leaders who believe more of the revenues should go to historically underserved communities. So whether we will see a TCI bill this year is anyone’s guess, but I’ve included it here because of the impact it would have if it does show up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three other transportation bills are more certain. One, called the Clean Car Standard, simply requires manufacturers of electric vehicles to send some of their vehicles to Virginia dealers, so consumers can actually buy them. (Weirdly, many dealers are opposed.) Del. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, is expected to carry the bill; its passage is a priority for a long list of environmental and grassroots groups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill from Del. David Reid, D-Loudoun, would have Virginia offer incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles, following recommendations from a 2019 </span><a href="https://www.virginiaev.org/?p=809" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I’m told we should also expect at least one bill from Del. Mark Keam, D-Fairfax, and one from Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, to get more electric school buses on the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another bill would require a Transit Modernization Study, which would gather information about how the public is currently being served by the existing transit system, including details as specific as which bus stops in which communities have benches and covered facilities. The study will determine which transit systems have infrastructure needs related to safety, reliability and environmental impact, such that when funding is available, the results of the study can ensure that funding is allocated equitably and to be used to make non-car options more appealing. A patron will be announced soon.</span></p>
<h2><b>Environmental Justice</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Shelly Simonds, D-Newport News, and Keam are expected to introduce a bill that will expand last year’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB406" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Justice Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to change how the state forms and carries out environmental justice policies within agencies, and to ensure greater public involvement in the permitting process at DEQ. Among other issues, residents often learn too late that Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality has finalized a permit for a facility that will add to the pollution in their community. The legislation would also require DEQ to consider the cumulative impact of polluting facilities — that is, to take into account whether the community is already overburdened.</span></p>
<h2><b>Low-income ratepayer protections</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Corporation Commission has been busy writing implementing regulations for many of the programs established by 2020 legislation. Some of the rules that have come out of the SCC are disappointing enough that I wouldn’t be surprised to see corrective legislation, but probably not until next year. One exception, where legislation is needed right away, concerns the Percentage of Income Payment Program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The PIPP is an important feature of the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB851&amp;201+sum+SB851" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Clean Economy Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  that caps utility bills for qualifying low-income customers. The SCC convened a stakeholder group to hammer out the details, but concluded the statute did not provide enough information to go on. An SCC </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4qxh01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> issued Dec. 23 left open critical elements of the program, and urged the General Assembly to provide additional legislative guidance. It is very late in the year to craft a response and secure a patron, but the administration and advocates are trying. </span></p>
<h2><b>Pipelines</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill from Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, adds specificity to the currently vague process that governs small to medium changes in pipeline routes and may impact permit conditions like erosion control measures. Currently it is unclear under what conditions DEQ must re-examine plans it has previously approved. The legislation will bring clarity and explicit direction to all parties involved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least one and possibly two other bills that would affect pipeline construction are also said to be in the works, but I have no details.</span></p>
<h2><b>Fossil fuel moratorium</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year’s Virginia Clean Economy Act contains a two-year moratorium on new fossil fuel electric generating plants. Del. Joshua Cole, D-Fredericksburg, is expected to introduce legislation expanding this into a permanent moratorium on all new fossil fuel infrastructure, to take effect in 2022. The bill would exempt retail projects like local gas hook-ups but would otherwise affect not just electric generation, but pipelines, fracking infrastructure, refineries and processing facilities. </span></p>
<h2><b>Utility reform</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year saw a number of bills that would affect how our utilities do business. These issues have not gone away, so we should expect to see legislation to strengthen SCC oversight and pare back the ability of utilities to pocket overearnings. </span></p>
<h2><b>Will there be bad bills?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, we should expect to see a few bills from Republicans attempting to roll back parts (or all) of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, or trying to block Virginia’s participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. These aren’t expected to get far in the Democratically-controlled General Assembly. </span></p>

(Photo courtesy Furman University)</p><p>Everybody has a favorite topic to bring up at parties when someone who knows them only vaguely and can’t remember what line of work they’re in seeks clues by asking, “So what have you been up to lately?”</p>
<p>“Advocating for offshore wind!” I used to respond brightly, which is why I wasn’t that popular at parties even before the pandemic.</p>
<p>But I got my longed-for turbines when Virginia Governor Ralph Northam and Dominion Energy committed to developing 2,600 megawatts of offshore wind by the middle of this decade.</p>
<p>So now I’m campaigning for another cutting-edge technology, or rather, for a cutting-edge combination of otherwise familiar technologies. I’m talking about agrivoltaics. For those of you not in the know, agrivoltaics refers to using land for solar panels and farming purposes at the same time. The “construction footprint” of solar—that is, the amount of land at a solar facility that is taken up by infrastructure and can’t be used for anything else—is less than 2%. The rest is up for grabs.</p>
<p>Consider one approach. At most utility-scale solar facilities, the ground under and between the rows of solar panels is planted in grass, which has to be mowed periodically. Instead of paying a maintenance crew to come through with lawn mowers, why not hire sheep to do the lawn care? The sheep do a better job at less cost, the shepherds get fresh pasture for their flock, and the soil gets nicely fertilized.</p>
<p>(Sheep, it turns out, are the grazers of preference. Cattle like to rub up against things that ought not to have 1200-pound animals rubbing against them, and goats—well, they’re goats: they eat the wiring.)</p>
<p>I admit I have no personal knowledge of this, since I live in wooded suburbs with neither solar panels nor sheep. The closest I get to country life is owning a dog of the farm collie variety. And she shows no talent for herding, though it’s possible she is just not in her element. Five years after arriving here from rural South Carolina, Ellie has still not gotten over her indignation at having been “rescued” by a family without a farm.</p>
<p>Actually, I recently toyed with the fantasy of moving to a farm, which is such a COVID cliché that I apologize for mentioning it. But if my fellow residents of Northern Virginia haven’t done this yourselves, you will cry in your morning latte to learn that for the price of the average home in the D.C. area, you can buy hundreds of acres of open space elsewhere in Virginia, typically with a house thrown in. Alas, not a single listing mentioned suitability for solar, with or without sheep, and when I caught on that they didn’t mention internet access either, my enthusiasm waned.</p>
<p>So what I know about solar sheep comes mostly from the <a href="https://solargrazing.org" target="_blank">American Solar Grazing Association</a>, which I urge you to check out because it is by far the cutest professional organization I have ever belonged to. Most of the projects it highlights are small in scale, given that the partnership between solar developers and shepherds is a new one. Still, the partnerships work because they save money for solar project owners and earn money for graziers.</p>
<p>A few Virginia farmers and developers have shown it works. The 3-megawatt <a href="https://newsadvance.com/news/local/heres-a-bright-idea-sheep-work-to-keep-vegetation-under-control-at-solar-farm-in/article_ac6b2e0e-6939-11e9-8635-9b3c3f46097e.html" target="_blank">Bedford Solar Farm</a> has used sheep as the primary means of vegetation management since beginning operations in January 2018. Sheep are also on the job at the 1.3-megawatt solar facility at Carilion New River Valley Medical Center near Roanoke. The project owner, Secure Futures LLC, argues for the economic and environmental benefits in an enthusiastic <a href="https://securefutures.solar/8-reasons-why-the-world-needs-solar-sheep/" target="_blank">blogpost</a> (but beware of the b-a-a-a-d puns).</p>
<p>For others, the bigger benefit comes in community acceptance. The more a solar facility looks and operates like an agricultural use, the easier it will be to integrate it into the rural landscape. If we want Virginia to succeed in its quest to decarbonize our electricity supply, we need more solar. We need much more of it on rooftops and parking lots and closed landfills, but we also need the big projects. The carbon math just doesn’t work otherwise.</p>
<p>Virginia’s solar industry is young, but developers already report difficulty in securing permits for projects that require hundreds or even thousands of acres. The industry sweetened the pot this year by supporting laws that provide extra revenue to counties in exchange for hosting projects. But solar was already a good deal for county government and landowners, producing more revenue for both than farming alone. The people putting up a fuss are the neighbors.</p>
<figure id="attachment_23791" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:2000px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solar-sheep.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-23791" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solar-sheep.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solar-sheep.jpg 2000w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solar-sheep-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solar-sheep-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solar-sheep-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solar-sheep-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solar-sheep-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solar-sheep-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solar-sheep-630x420.jpg 630w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/solar-sheep-1920x1280.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Sheep graze under a solar array.

<p>I’m not terribly sympathetic to these folks. Virginia has lost way more farmland and forests to subdivisions than it ever will to solar projects, including the subdivisions many of those complaining neighbors live in (looking at you, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-20/how-to-get-around-solar-energy-s-nimby-problem" target="_blank">Fawn Lake!</a>). Land that is carved up and paved over never becomes a field or forest again, but solar is a temporary use; when the lease is up, the panels and their supports are taken away, and an open meadow remains.</p>
<p>As for concerns about losing land that was growing food, we need to keep in mind that more than 30 million acres of U.S. farmland is largely <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2014/04/20/its-final-corn-ethanol-is-of-no-use/?sh=5a01871967d3" target="_blank">wasted</a> today growing the 40 percent of U.S. corn production that gets <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn-and-other-feedgrains/feedgrains-sector-at-a-glance/" target="_blank">processed into ethanol</a> for mixing with gasoline. Solar is not competing with food.</p>
<p>But it isn’t me who has to be persuaded, it’s the people who show up at public hearings to oppose what they regard as some kind of industrial eyesore. They don’t care that leasing land for solar may be what lets a family hold onto their farm. They don’t want to look at it.</p>
<p>So developers, and the utilities who buy the projects from them, have to do more to make themselves welcome by offering other benefits. It doesn’t have to be sheep. Some developers offer wildlife-friendly fencing and set aside land for walking trails. Another especially welcome trend is for facility owners to plant native wildflowers in place of grass to support bees and other pollinators.</p>
<p>If sheep don’t move you, pollinators should. We are in a biodiversity crisis as well as a climate crisis, and populations of native bees critical to pollination of many food crops are in <a href="https://www.scientia.global/pollinator-decline-implications-for-food-security-environment/?doing_wp_cron=1607358254.8346860408782958984375" target="_blank">steep decline</a>. So why not make use of the space under solar panels to strike a blow for bees? Neighboring farmers also benefit, because studies show that attracting insect pollinators <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/features/2019/beneath-solar-panels-the-seeds-of-opportunity-sprout.html" target="_blank">increases yields of food crops</a> grown nearby. A study from Yale University found <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28112020/pollinator-friendly-solar-greenwashing-risk/" target="_blank">additional benefits</a>, including the cooling effect of native plantings that increase solar production.</p>
<p>Minnesota and Maryland are leading the way in formalizing programs with guidelines and incentives for pollinator-friendly solar facilities, but Virginia is also out front on this topic. The Departments of Conservation and Recreation (DCR), Mines, Minerals and Energy (DMME), and Environmental Quality (DEQ) created the <a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/natural-heritage/pollinator-smart" target="_blank">Virginia Pollinator-Smart Solar Program</a> and developed a scorecard to help local governments and solar developers understand how to achieve pollinator-friendly status. (Check out the terrific <a href="https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/natural-heritage/pollinator-smart" target="_blank">webinar</a> from last April.)</p>
<p>Solar developer <a href="https://suntribesolar.com/learn/gold-certified-pollinator-friendly-solar/" target="_blank">Sun Tribe</a> announced it achieved the state’s first Gold Certified solar site under the program at Cople Elementary School in Westmoreland County, where the solar array sits on 4.3 acres. Small projects like this should be simple to replicate, but scaling up may be harder.</p>
<p>For one thing, the only large supplier of native plant seeds in our region, <a href="https://www.ernstseed.com" target="_blank">Ernst Conservation Seeds</a> in Pennsylvania, projects that it would take up to ten years to build up enough stock to supply a robust utility-scale solar market. (Ernst also has a seed mix designed for those who want both pollinator plants and sheep among their solar panels; of course it’s called “Fuzz and Buzz.”)</p>
<p>The solar companies I’ve spoken with are enthusiastic, but they cite one other challenge: persuading their customers, including utilities, to accept sheep or pollinator plantings on site. So we may have to look to other kinds of customers for leadership: institutional buyers, corporations and government buyers — the kind of customers for whom social and environmental benefits add value beyond the cheap electricity they can get from solar.</p>
<p>I don’t imagine I will ever be able to give my dog a farm, with or without solar sheep, but I take comfort in the certainty that grazing, native plantings and other co-benefits will eventually become standard practice, simply because they’ll have to.</p>
<p>Meeting our energy needs sustainably means solar is going to become a visible part of our landscape. The job of the solar industry, its allies and its customers is to make that not just tolerable, but welcome. And for that, solar projects must offer more than energy.</p>

(Sean Rayford/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately following the 2016 election of Donald Trump, I wrote a </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2016/11/10/why-trump-wont-stop-the-clean-energy-revolution/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">column</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> titled “Why Trump won’t stop the clean energy revolution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you were to read it now, you would yawn. What seemed bold back then now feels like forecasting the inevitable. Of course coal has not come back. Of course wind and solar are cheaper now than fossil fuels. Of course people agree a zero-carbon future is achievable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, few of us could have predicted how far off course Trump would try to take us. Withdrawing from the Paris climate accord was the least of it. The Washington Post</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tallied more than </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/climate-environment/trump-climate-environment-protections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">125 rollbacks of environmental regulations and policies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the past four years. Trump’s more flamboyant acts of perfidy distracted attention away from his sustained attack, not just on climate science, but on the laws protecting America’s lands, air and water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really, we should be grateful Trump staffed his administration with grifters and sycophants who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/climate/trump-florida-offshore-drilling.html" target="_blank">repeatedly bungled</a> the details and opened their decisions to legal challenge. Incompetence is underrated. Skilled managers would have done much more damage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the past four years have also pushed us closer to the brink of climate chaos and the collapse of ecosystems. We wasted time we did not have. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As president, Joe Biden will be able to undo most of the environmental rollbacks with new executive orders and agency actions. Biden has also promised </span><a href="https://joebiden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UNITY-TASK-FORCE-RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a long list of new initiatives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though many of them would require Democratic control of the Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia and other states partially filled the four-year void with commitments to decarbonize our electricity supply and build renewable energy. But even for Virginia the path to zero-carbon would be a lot easier with federal action. Public support for climate action is strong </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even from Republicans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though it’s hard to imagine a really aggressive climate bill getting a floor vote in the Senate while Mitch McConnell is in charge. (In my dreams, Maine Senator Susan Collins announces she is changing her party affiliation to Independent and will caucus with Democrats </span><a href="https://bangordailynews.com/2020/09/21/politics/how-maines-us-senate-candidates-differ-on-climate-change-and-the-environment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to get a climate bill passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I have really great dreams.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s assume for now, though, that Joe is on his own. What can he do through executive orders and agency actions? A lot, it turns out, so I’ll just focus on a few high-profile moves and how they might affect the energy transition here in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon emissions: a new Clean Power Plan?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Recall that back in 2016, the EPA finalized regulations under the Clean Air Act designed to reduce carbon emissions from power plants with state-by-state targets. Lawsuits and backpedaling by the Trump EPA prevented the Clean Power Plan from ever taking effect, and the replacement plan was </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/19/18684054/climate-change-clean-power-plan-repeal-affordable-emissions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">derided for its weakness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years later, a Biden EPA could use the same Clean Air Act authority to write new regulations. The thing is, though, the Clean Power Plan put the squeeze on coal-dependent states but would have had </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2015/08/13/for-virginia-epas-clean-power-plan-more-like-a-powderpuff/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">virtually no effect on Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And that was before the Virginia Clean Economy Act set us on a path to decarbonization, putting Virginia ahead of any revamped rule that might come out of the EPA now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A better scenario for us would be if the threat of new climate action from EPA brought Republican senators to the table for a climate bill that would, say, impose a carbon tax (or fee-and-dividend) in return for stripping EPA of its authority to regulate carbon emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I promised to focus on what Biden can do without Congress, so let’s get back to that. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Among the protections Trump tried to roll back are EPA regulations like the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard and the Coal Ash Rule, both of which limit pollution caused by coal plants. While both are in litigation (see “bungling,” above), we can expect the EPA under Biden to reverse course and, if anything, tighten these protections. Virginia has already committed to closing most of its coal plants, a decision that will prove even wiser when coal plants have to meet stricter standards.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, these Trump regulatory rollbacks didn’t do the coal industry any good. Nationally, coal plants have continued to close </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063430425" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">at an even faster rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than they did during Obama’s second term. The false hopes Trump offered for a coal renaissance forestalled real efforts to help communities in Appalachia transition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here in Virginia, even coalfields legislators understand the need to diversify the economy of Southwest Virginia. Biden’s election is their wake-up call to stop trying to revive a past that was never a golden era for workers anyway, however enriching it was for the coal bosses. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fracked gas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Biden made it clear he would not ban fracking other than on federal lands, but we can expect stronger regulations to limit the leakage of methane from wellheads, pipelines and storage infrastructure. That’s a Virginia priority, too. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy efficiency</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Federal efficiency requirements for products including appliances and HVAC systems have proven to be low-cost and consumer-friendly. A renewed focus on strong national standards will help reduce per-capita energy consumption and help Virginia meet its carbon reduction goals at less cost to consumers. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind and solar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It would take legislation to extend federal tax credits for renewable energy, but there are other actions the Biden administration can take to support wind and solar. These include increased funding of R&amp;D through the Department of Energy (a program that already has support in Congress), and removing tariffs on imported solar panels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can also help wind and solar. FERC has caused its share of climate damage, most memorably for Virginians by approving the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines. FERC’s decisions also control the playing field for the electricity sector, including rules that currently disadvantage wind and solar in the wholesale markets. These rules could just as easily be rewritten. Although FERC is an independent agency, Biden will have an opportunity to appoint climate-friendly FERC commissioners as vacancies occur and terms expire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And indeed, FERC is already starting to come around. Chairman Neil Chatterjee recently hosted a technical conference and </span><a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/ferc-proposes-policy-statement-state-determined-carbon-pricing-wholesale-markets" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued a proposed policy statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on carbon pricing in regional markets, an act that may have led Trump to </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/trump-ousts-chatterjee-taps-danly-to-lead-ferc/588526/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demote him</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this month. </span></p>

(Getty Images)</p></figure>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore wind</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Within the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issues offshore energy leases and oversees development of offshore projects, including wind farms. More than a year ago offshore wind activity at BOEM ground almost to a halt, setting back one project after another. Congress isn’t happy, and it </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/eenewspm/2020/11/10/stories/1063718207" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">may direct more funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to BOEM to help re-start the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biden will also direct BOEM to get out of the way of current projects and begin the process of designating new offshore lease areas for development. Both of these are critical to Virginia’s clean energy plans. (Of course, an investment tax credit for offshore wind would help, too — but there I go again, looking for legislation.)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transportation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Until Trump came in, the auto industry was gradually improving fuel economy standards in new cars and light trucks. Biden will put that program back in place, and likely impose more stringent tailpipe emission standards. These moves will boost the transition to electric and hybrid vehicles and lead to lower carbon emissions from the transportation sector, another Virginia priority.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Declaring a national climate emergency</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a long shot, but Biden could use his executive authority to </span><a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/03/what-democratic-president-could-do-climate-national-emergency/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declare a climate emergency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the way Trump declared a national emergency to redirect funds from national defense to his border fence. There are many ways this could help the Virginia transition if Biden were to go this route. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course he won’t. Biden is no Trump. And for that, we should all be grateful.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p>With Virginia fully committed to the clean energy transition, you would think that by now, residents would be able to check a box on their utility bill to buy solar energy, or at least be able to call up a third-party solar provider to sell them electricity from solar.</p>
<p>Not so. Sure, if you’re fortunate enough to own your own house or commercial building, and it’s in a sunny location and the roof is sound, you can install solar panels for your own use. Renters, though, are completely out of luck, which means almost all lower and moderate-income people are shut out of the solar market.</p>
<p>Actually, we were all supposed to be able to buy solar by now. A 2017 law required utilities to offer a “community solar” program. Utilities would buy electricity from solar facilities and sell it to customers. At least one electric cooperative <a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2018/05/25/central-virginia-electric-cooperative-finds-solar-hits-a-sweet-spot/" target="_blank">followed through</a>, but although Dominion Energy, Virginia&#8217;s biggest utility, created a program and had it <a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2018/09/17/dominion-gets-the-nod-to-sell-solar-energy-to-us-regular-folks/" target="_blank">approved by the SCC</a> in 2018, the company has never offered it.</p>
<p>So this year the General Assembly passed two bills that would finally bring the benefits of solar energy to a broader range of customers. One would be community solar but under a different name. It would let anyone buy electricity from a <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1238" target="_blank">“shared solar”</a> facility, with at least 30 percent of the output reserved for low-income customers.</p>
<p>The other, the leadoff section of the <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1188" target="_blank">Solar Freedom</a> legislation, would let residents of apartment buildings and condominiums share the output of a solar array located on the premises or next door.</p>
<p>The bills were narrowed in committee to apply only in Dominion Energy territory (and for the multifamily program, to a part of Southwest Virginia served by Kentucky Utilities). Dominion also lobbied successfully for changes to the shared solar bill that raised red flags with solar industry members and advocates. Dominion has a long history of putting barriers in the way of customers who want solar, and the final language of the shared solar legislation pretty much invited that sort of mischief.</p>
<p>Still, it was left to the State Corporation Commission to write rules implementing the programs, so customers had reason to hope Dominion would not be allowed to make the programs unwieldy and expensive.</p>
<p><em>Ha.</em> What has emerged from the SCC in the form of proposed rules manages to be both incoherent and everything Dominion wants. The reason for that is clear: most of the rules are copied and pasted from proposals Dominion submitted in August.</p>
<p>Adopting the recommendations of a company that failed to follow through on its own program seems like a bad idea. Hasn’t Dominion abdicated its right to tell other companies how to execute community solar?</p>
<p>And of course, with Dominion writing the rules, the programs won’t work. The <a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4p4101!.PDF" target="_blank">shared solar</a> option doesn’t kick in until at least 2023, and customers won’t be told what it will cost them. The SCC proposes to hold an “annual proceeding” to decide each year how much subscribers will have to pay in the form of a minimum bill, an amount that can then change from year to year.</p>
<p>This minimum bill is not the eight or nine dollar fixed charge that all customers pay today; it’s a whole new charge representing various of Dominion’s real or imagined costs of doing business, which Dominion says it needs to recover from the subscribers to compensate it for the fact that some other company is now selling them electricity.</p>
<p>How much might this be? No one knows. And because no one knows, it’s also impossible for solar companies or other third-party providers to offer the program. They can’t sell a product whose price is unknown, and banks aren’t going to loan them money to build a solar facility with no assurance that there will be customers.</p>
<p>There are really only two ways to save this program. The SCC could hold an evidentiary hearing upfront to examine the costs Dominion claims it needs to recover and then decide what the minimum bill ought to be. If that number is so high that the program can’t work, the SCC gets the privilege of telling the General Assembly there won’t be a shared solar program after all.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the SCC can follow the lead of states that already have successful programs and set the minimum bill (upfront) at a level that still saves customers money, so projects have a fighting chance of getting off the ground. If Dominion thinks it is losing money on the deal, that’s a claim it can pursue in its next rate case — which is where the dispute belongs.</p>
<p>Either way, the industry needs clarity, and it needs it now.</p>
<h2><strong>Multifamily solar: from straightforward to hopeless</strong></h2>
<p>The drafters of Solar Freedom thought they’d avoided the mess that threatens to tank the shared solar program. The multifamily provision of Solar Freedom is simply a way to let residents of apartment buildings and other multifamily units enjoy the same benefits available to homeowners who install solar under the net metering program. Instead of putting solar on a roof they own, they can buy the output of solar panels on the roof of the building where they live. It’s not net metering, but that’s the model.</p>
<p>Since the solar is onsite, none of these projects will be big. Keeping it simple and inexpensive is important. The law provides that utilities will credit participating customers for their share of solar at a rate “set such that the shared solar program results in robust project development and shared solar program access for all customer classes.” More specifically, the commission “shall annually calculate the applicable bill credit rate as the effective retail rate of the customer&#8217;s rate class, which shall be inclusive of all supply charges, delivery charges, demand charges, fixed charges and any applicable riders or other charges to the customer.”</p>
<p>The law couldn’t be clearer: there is to be no minimum bill, and the utility cannot load up a customer’s bill with lots of miscellaneous extra charges. All those charges that the SCC loads into the shared solar program’s minimum bill are, for the multifamily program, already included in the retail rate.</p>
<p>End of discussion? Not hardly. The <a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4p4201!.PDF" target="_blank">SCC’s implementing rules </a>— which are Dominion’s rules — get around this problem by dumping all the minimum bill elements from the shared solar rules onto the program provider instead (that is, the company that owns the solar panels).</p>
<p>Solar Freedom doesn’t actually allow that, either, so the SCC has decided these costs should be part of the one fee the utility <em>is </em>allowed to collect, for “reasonable costs of administering the program.” Never mind that items like “standby generation and balancing costs” have nothing to do with administering the program.</p>
<p>Oh, and the SCC won’t decide what the administrative charge will be until it holds an annual proceeding. And the amount can change every year. So once again, the SCC has designed a program that no solar company will be able to offer.</p>
<p>The SCC rules are so blatantly contrary to the program mandate set out in Solar Freedom that one can’t help but wonder whose side the SCC is on.</p>
<p>It is certainly not the customers’. We want solar.</p>
<p>The SCC is accepting comments on the proposed rules for both the <a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/casecomments/comment/PUR-2020-00125" target="_blank">shared solar</a> and <a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/casecomments/comment/PUR-2020-00124" target="_blank">multifamily</a> programs through Monday.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: <em>The SCC is accepting comment on the proposed rules through Monday. This column has been updated to reflect that correction.</em></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in 2017, two Republican legislators from Southwest Virginia helped Dominion Energy Virginia secure </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+ful+CHAP0820+hil" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing the utility to charge ratepayers for a new pumped hydro storage facility to be built in the coalfields region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The law even deemed the project “in the public interest.” Three years later, Dominion included a new pumped hydro project in its </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4m_l01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Integrated Resource Plan.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The 300-megawatt facility would be built in Tazewell County and come online in 2030.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But — surprise, surprise — details in the IRP reveal the project to be unneeded and its price exorbitant. That leaves just one question: Will the State Corporation Commission approve the IRP anyway?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumped hydro stores surplus energy using two reservoirs, one at the top of a hill and one at the bottom. When you need energy, you release water from the upper reservoir and let it flow down through a hydroelectric turbine to the lower reservoir. When you have a surplus of energy, you use it to pump water uphill to fill the upper reservoir. Repeat as needed. It’s not high-tech, but it gets the job done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today pumped storage is used mostly to store surplus energy at night from baseload fossil fuel and nuclear plants that run 24/7, then use the energy to meet the surge in demand during daylight and early evening hours. As wind and solar become bigger players, pumped storage can also help integrate these variable resources in much the same way that batteries can. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But pumped storage is land-intensive, and each project has to be designed for its own particular site, making it expensive to develop. Or in this case, very expensive. In its </span><a href="https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/d/NYSE_D_2017.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 Annual Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dominion said its project would cost up to $2 billion and provide up to 1,000 MW of storage capacity ($2 million per megawatt, not terrible for this kind of storage). Three years later the size has shrunk by 70 percent but the cost has actually gone up and now stands at $2.3 billion ($7.7 million per megawatt, genuinely terrible). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That didn’t stop Dominion from including the 300 MW of new pumped storage hydro in every scenario of its IRP, not allowing its modeling software the option of rejecting it as unneeded or as more expensive than other options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was once an interesting project idea now looks a heck of a lot like another Dominion boondoggle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia embarks on a transition to 100 percent carbon-free electricity, the ability to store energy has become a hot topic of discussion. How much do we need, and can batteries do it all? The one advantage that pumped storage has over batteries is that a pumped storage facility can supply energy over a longer duration: 10 hours as opposed to the four hours typical of most batteries. For the rare occasions when you really need those extra hours, pumped hydro can be a solution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it happens, though, Dominion is already the majority owner of the world’s largest pumped hydro project. The 3,000 MW facility in Bath County, Virginia, has been in operation since 1985. Dominion earns money by selling its energy storage service to the operator of the regional transmission grid, PJM Interconnection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three thousand megawatts is a lot of storage; the Bath County facility is even nicknamed </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_County_Pumped_Storage_Station" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“the world’s largest battery.”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> So building more pumped storage would only be reasonable if the Bath County facility were already being used to its maximum capacity (or was projected to max out in the future), and if a new facility could meet a need that can’t be met by alternatives like batteries. Unfortunately for Dominion, neither of those is true. Tazewell is a solution in search of a problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumers smell a rat. Dominion customer Glen Besa intervened in the IRP case this summer to challenge the inclusion of the Tazewell project. Besa retired a few years ago as director of the Virginia Chapter of the Sierra Club; he is acting on his own behalf in this case, represented by attorney William Reisinger of the firm ReisingerGooch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm hired energy storage expert Kerinia Cusick. </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4p2h01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her testimony</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> points out that the IRP shows the Bath County facility is expected to be used </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">less</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the coming years, not more. The IRP projects capacity factors for the facility will decline steadily from 10.7 percent in 2021 to 7.5 percent in 2035. If an existing facility has spare capacity, there is no good case for building another facility like it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cusick also compared the $2.3 billion cost of the Tazewell project to an equivalent amount of battery storage. Not surprisingly, the battery storage won hands down. Indeed, Cusick noted, the cost of battery storage has fallen over the years and is projected to continue doing so. By contrast, she found Dominion had understated the costs of the pumped storage project by excluding items like land costs and taxes. (The real number she calculated, unfortunately, is not available to us. It has been redacted from the public version of Cusick’s testimony.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, there is no need for the Tazewell project, and no economic case to support it. Adding billions of dollars in unneeded infrastructure to Dominion’s rate base will add profit for Dominion shareholders but drive up electricity bills for consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no way the SCC would let Dominion get away with this if legislators hadn’t used the magic words “in the public interest.” Now the question is whether those magic words are all it takes to ram a project through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC takes its job of protecting ratepayers seriously; it does not welcome legislative interference. Only grudgingly did the SCC allow itself to be </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/11/05/offshore-wind-if-its-dominions-way-or-the-highway-we-have-to-do-it-dominions-way/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coerced into approving</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dominion’s offshore wind pilot when the legislature proclaimed the pilot project in the public interest. In that case, after pointing out the high cost and risks borne by ratepayers, the SCC order concluded by grumbling, “Recent amendments to Virginia laws that mandate that such a project be found to be ‘in the public interest’ make it clear that certain factual findings must be subordinated to the clear legislative intent expressed in the laws governing the petition.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the offshore wind pilot was just that, a pilot, and its $300 million price tag represented an investment in a new industry that is expected to become a mainstay of Virginia’s future energy supply. Legislators knew the costs, and judged them acceptable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pumped hydro, on the other hand, is a mature technology. The proposed Tazewell project won’t lead to bigger and better things, driving costs down along the way. Legislators deemed it “in the public interest” for Dominion to locate a pumped storage project in the coalfields because they are desperate for jobs there. But they were misled about the actual cost. That ought to matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it doesn’t matter — if the SCC decides “in the public interest” always means a blank check to Dominion, written by the General Assembly but charged to the account of customers — then legislators need to change the law. We can’t afford another boondoggle. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last winter, during the fight to pass the Virginia Clean Economy Act, Dominion Energy lobbyists went out of their way to save the company’s youngest coal plant in Wise County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It worked. Legislators exempted the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center from closure until 2045, when Dominion has to shutter all its fossil fuel generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCHEC was approved in 2008 and built in 2013 as </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/05/the-wise-county-coal-plant-should-never-have-been-built-why-fight-to-keep-it-open/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a boondoggle for Dominion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, earning the company an enhanced rate of return. It was also intended as an expensive gift from then-Gov. Tim Kaine to coalfield Democrats, who went on to lose their seats anyway. Even then, it was a terrible deal for Dominion’s customers and the climate, with all the carbon pollution you expect from coal and a cost that was twice that of cleaner alternatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder it proved to be one of the last coal plants ever built in the U.S. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing this, and knowing the determination of this year’s General Assembly to turn the commonwealth in the direction of clean energy, you might not have expected VCHEC to have a lot of friends left in Richmond. But Dominion never told legislators what it would cost consumers to keep its coal plants running. Among all the criticism of the price tag associated with Virginia’s energy transition — much of that criticism coming from Dominion itself — one crucial fact gets lost: It’s coal that is hitting consumers the hardest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An analysis Dominion reluctantly made public last month as part of its Integrated Resource Planning case shows that VCHEC is far and away the worst performing economically of all the utility’s fossil fuel-burning plants. This one coal plant carries a 10-year net present value of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">negative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $472 million. It isn’t the only coal plant in Dominion’s fleet with a negative valuation, just the worst. In fact, all the Virginia coal plants have negative values. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are Dominion’s numbers, not those of the Sierra Club or the other environmental and consumer groups challenging Dominion’s plans. The Sierra Club hired a consulting company to run its own analysis, using a standard utility model. </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4p2501!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concluded it would be cheaper for customers to build more solar now and speed up the closure not just of VCHEC but of all Dominion’s coal plants. This includes even the company’s Mount Storm coal plant in West Virginia, the only one assigned a positive economic value in Dominion’s analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a customer standpoint, all of them should go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe that’s not too surprising. We already knew coal was dead. But how many of us knew we were paying to prop up the corpse?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s lawyers </span><a href="https://scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4_wn01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tried to keep the terrible cost numbers out of the public’s hands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, contending it was “confidential commercial and financial information that other entities could use to their competitive advantage in future negotiations.” I can imagine these future meetings: the other entities would be so busy mocking Dominion that, indeed, negotiations might stall permanently.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately for all of us, the Attorney General’s Office of Consumer Counsel persuaded the SCC the information should be public. Some information truly is confidential; this is merely embarrassing. Dominion’s customers—and the General Assembly—should know what it’s costing us to prop up coal. </span></p>

(2018 photo via NASA)</p><p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says this year’s hurricane season <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/08/06/hurricane-outlook-extremely-active/" target="_blank">could set a record</a> for the number of storms big enough to be given names. NOAA now predicts a total of 19 to 25 named storms (winds of 39 mph or greater) in the Atlantic, of which 7 to 11 are likely to become hurricanes. Isaias, a Category 1 hurricane, <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/predictions-2020-atlantic-hurricane-storm-season-worse" target="_blank">was already the ninth named storm</a> of this season.</p>
<p>With global warming heating the ocean and <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2019/07/how-climate-change-is-making-hurricanes-more-dangerous/" target="_blank">making hurricanes worse</a>, states and localities have to prepare not just for the storms but also for their aftermath, when residents are left without power, sometimes for days.</p>
<p>I still have keen and unpleasant memories of 2003’s Hurricane Isabel, one of Virginia’s <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/story/39053260/top-5-worst-hurricanes-to-impact-central-virginia/" target="_blank">deadliest and costliest</a> storms. My family was among the 2 million households who lost power.</p>
<p>For eight days we used a camp lantern for light and cooked outside over fires kindled in a Weber grill. We ate our way through the thawing contents of the freezer, then got creative with canned foods. We have a well with an electric pump, so our water supply consisted of what was in the jugs and pots we filled before the storm hit. And without power for our septic pump, we could not put anything down the drain or flush toilets. (My daughters were just hitting their teen years at the time. You can imagine how well they took this.)</p>
<p>Still, we were lucky. We didn’t need power to run a medical device like an oxygen machine or wheelchair, or to keep medicine refrigerated. Firewood and a grill gave us a cooking option we wouldn’t have had if we lived in an apartment, and we owned plenty of jugs and pots to hold water. Most importantly, if it had gotten bad enough we could have left in our car — something many city dwellers don’t have, especially if they are low-income or elderly.</p>
<p>After Isabel, a lot of my neighbors went out and got generators, buying peace of mind for themselves but underscoring how the wealth gap affects even the ability to weather a storm. Yet in these intervening years, electricity has truly become central to everything Americans do. We get our information over the internet; business happens online; cell phones have replaced landlines. In an emergency, having access to electricity can mean the difference between getting help and having none.</p>
<p>The traditional government response to a hurricane warning is to issue evacuation orders and designate emergency shelters, but experience has shown that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/10/18/658258370/why-stay-during-a-hurricane-because-its-not-as-simple-as-get-out" target="_blank">a lot of people stay put</a>. Some can’t afford to leave or lack transportation. Others have pets they can’t take with them and won’t leave behind, or they fear looters might take advantage of their absence. Distrust of government probably plays a role, too, making some folks prefer to take their chances with a storm than let people in uniform tell them what to do.</p>
<p>And this year, of course, the pandemic will make people even more hesitant to leave home.</p>
<p>The hurricane hunker-downers, and everyone else left without power after a storm, need access to electricity that doesn’t depend on the grid. There weren’t many options 17 years ago, when Isabel hit. Since then, though, the technological innovations that are transforming our energy supply have also created ways to keep the power flowing that don’t require balky, fuel-dependent generators.</p>
<p>Solar panels on a community center, school or other centrally-located and publicly-accessible building can provide continuous power when the sun is shining; adding batteries allows the panels to keep providing power at night and when the grid is down. Even just a few solar panels can power lights and provide cellphone charging. A larger array will run a refrigerator, microwave, television and coffeemaker. If it is large enough, it can even provide heating and cooling.</p>
<p>A site like this might serve as an emergency shelter for evacuees, or be part of a microgrid that includes nearby critical services such as a police or fire station. But it could be just a neighborhood location where people drop by to charge phones and computers, heat food, get news and see familiar faces. This concept is known as a “<a href="http://resilience-hub.org" target="_blank">resilience hub</a>,” and it’s the sort of modest investment that punches above its weight in community benefits. Good emergency planning should include locating a resilience hub wherever people are most likely to suffer in the aftermath of a storm due to lack of mobility, old age, disability or poverty.</p>
<p>The challenge, of course, is that a resilience hub or microgrid requires an upfront investment. Solar panels pay for themselves over time by reducing electricity bills, but someone still has to front the cost. <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/18/new-laws-clear-away-barriers-to-small-solar-projects/" target="_blank">Legislation passed this year</a> makes that much easier, and local governments are already saving money with solar on public buildings across the state.</p>
<p>The battery is more of a problem. If it simply sits around waiting for a power outage, it won’t earn its keep over the 10-15 years of its useful life. A battery that isn’t providing useful services on a regular basis is also <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/4/27/17283830/batteries-energy-storage-carbon-emissions" target="_blank">bad for the planet</a>, since batteries have an environmental footprint of their own.</p>
<p>But a battery doesn’t need to sit idle. When it is not being used to provide stored energy in a power outage, the battery could provide a range of <a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2019/Sep/IRENA_BTM_Batteries_2019.pdf" target="_blank">benefits to the grid</a>, helping to meet peak demand, integrate renewable energy, and provide frequency regulation and other ancillary services. This is such a valuable service to the grid that in Vermont, utility <a href="https://greenmountainpower.com/product/powerwall/" target="_blank">Green Mountain Power</a> pays for much of the cost of batteries in the homes of customers in exchange for the right to use them.</p>
<p>Virginia has no resilience hubs yet, and the fiscal crisis caused by the pandemic means local governments may not have funding for them. However, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is <a href="https://microgridknowledge.com/fema-infrastructure-grants-microgrids/" target="_blank">offering $500 million</a> in grants under a program that looks tailor-made for resilience hubs and microgrids that power critical services and other community needs on an emergency basis.</p>
<p>Our utilities could also play an active role. The recently enacted Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) provides all the authority Dominion Energy Virginia and Appalachian Power need to support solar-plus-storage at neighborhood locations. The law permits the utilities to even own the solar, if they want to, if an array meets a 50-kilowatt minimum size.</p>
<p>More importantly, Dominion and Appalachian can own the batteries, or contract with third parties to be able to use them. The VCEA sets out ambitious energy storage targets that include a “goal of installing at least 10 percent of such energy storage projects behind the meter”—a category that includes most customer-sited storage. The VCEA also allows utilities to select storage projects on a basis other than cost if a project “materially advances non-price criteria, including favoring geographic distribution of generating facilities.”</p>
<p>The State Corporation Commission took <a href="https://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch#/caseDetails/140913" target="_blank">comments</a> this summer on how to implement the VCEA’s requirements for energy storage. This is a good opportunity for the SCC to look beyond utility-scale projects that deliver storage services to the grid cheaply, but do nothing to provide backup power when the grid goes down. The SCC should insist utilities include storage at resilience hubs in neighborhoods that are most at risk from storms, and where residents are least likely to have other options when the grid goes down.</p>
<p>That probably won’t be near my house, but I’m okay with help going to the people who need it most. This year’s pandemic has exposed the interconnectedness of our lives in ways that usually lie beneath the surface. Whether it’s a virus, a natural disaster, climate change or acts of injustice, we are really all part of the same community.</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="468" height="600" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Little_pigs.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Little_pigs.jpg 468w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Little_pigs-234x300.jpg 234w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Little_pigs-328x420.jpg 328w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Public domain/ (Project Gutenberg)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You remember the story of the Three Little Pigs. First the little pigs built themselves a house out of straw, but the big, bad wolf huffed and puffed and blew it down. Barely escaping with their lives, the little pigs built a new house out of sticks, but again the big, bad wolf blew it down. Wiser at last, the little pigs built their third house out of brick, and they lived happily ever after because the wolf could not blow it down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you were a child, you probably did not realize what must be obvious to you now: the story is really about the importance of building codes. Shoddy construction brings nothing but grief, as the little pigs learned, and in the end it costs you more than if you had used high-quality materials right from the start. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is silent on whether our young porcine heroes also concerned themselves with the energy performance of their house, but it stands to reason they would have taken an interest in the U factors of windows and the R values of wall and ceiling insulation. Their experience with tropical storm-force wolf breath would have given them an appreciation for the snuggest possible construction. Possibly they even went on to put solar panels on their roof and an electric vehicle in the garage, but on this we can only speculate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bring up this story now because Virginia is in the final stages of adopting an update to its residential building code, a process the Board of Housing and Community Development undertakes every three years. In addition to ensuring the safety of wiring and plumbing and so forth, the Uniform Statewide Building Code sets standards that determine whether a new home is drafty and expensive to heat and cool, or will be comfortable, healthy and frugal with energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remarkably, the board is currently </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/ViewXML.cfm?textid=14136" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to continue outdated efficiency standards dating back years instead of adopting the more energy-saving provisions of the latest </span><a href="https://www.iccsafe.org/products-and-services/i-codes/2018-i-codes/iecc/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International Energy Conservation Code</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IECC), or even going beyond the IECC to Earth Craft or Passive House standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of the global pretentions of its name, the IECC is a national standard. </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title36/chapter6/section36-99/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> specifically instructs the board to refer to the IECC in adopting provisions that permit buildings to be constructed at least cost “consistent with recognized standards of health, safety, energy conservation and water conservation.” The code suggests that the board may go beyond the IECC for purposes of health and safety, but should not fall short of its standards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why is the board proposing lower standards? As far as we know, there is no wolf lobby advocating for flimsy homes, but there is a homebuilder lobby doing its own share of huffing and puffing — and Virginia’s code adoption process gives the homebuilders an outsized role in the decision-making process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better-insulated houses cost builders slightly more to build. They pass along the added costs if they can, but if buyers won’t pay more, the higher costs cut into profits. This being bad for business, builders prefer to lobby for lower standards that are cheaper to meet, insisting they have only the poor buyers’ pocketbooks at heart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their argument is, if you will pardon the expression, hogwash. Research demonstrates that houses built to the highest efficiency standards </span><a href="https://www.ase.org/resources/building-energy-codes-driving-down-energy-costs" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">save far more money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on energy over time than they add to the upfront cost of the house. This becomes especially important for occupants who don’t make much money and who struggle to afford utility bills. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board should ignore homebuilder objections and put the needs of building occupants first. Gov. Ralph Northam made it clear with his </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-43-Expanding-Access-to-Clean-Energy-and-Growing-the-Clean-Energy-Jobs-of-the-Future.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 43</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last fall that the commonwealth is now committed to a path of clean energy and energy efficiency. Bringing energy costs down for residents is not a side effect of the energy transition, but a feature. As he noted in the order, “Low-income households pay proportionately more than the average household for energy costs and often experience negative long-term effects on their health and welfare.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The climate crisis also makes it urgent that we use building codes to reduce our fossil fuel use. The Virginia Clean Economy Act will transition the electric sector to clean energy, but it does not require buildings to become more efficient. This is a problem because </span><a href="https://www.ase.org/initiatives/buildings" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">buildings represent 40 percent of all energy use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and houses typically last between 40 and 100 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some retrofits can be made later, at higher cost, but the cheapest and simplest approach is to build houses snugly to begin with. They should also be sited with solar in mind and have wiring in place to make solar easy. Ultimately (and “ultimately” has got to be pretty darn soon), we have to start building homes that produce as much energy as they use.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board is </span><a href="https://townhall.virginia.gov/L/comments.cfm?stageid=8877" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">accepting comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on its proposal through June 26. The Sierra Club has set up a </span><a href="https://act.sierraclub.org/actions/Virginia?actionId=AR0271471&amp;id=70131000001iOuIAAU" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to forward comments urging the board to adopt high efficiency standards. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more things change, the more they stay the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy Virginia filed its 2020 Integrated Resource Plan on May 1. Instead of charting the electric utility’s pathway to zero carbon emissions, it announced its intent to hang on to all its gas plants, and even add to the number. In doing so, it revealed a company so thoroughly wedded to fracked gas that it would rather flout Virginia law and risk its own future than do the hard work of transforming itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb851&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Clean Economy Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may be new, but Dominion can hardly claim to be surprised by the commonwealth’s move away from fossil fuels. Gov. Ralph Northam’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-43-Expanding-Access-to-Clean-Energy-and-Growing-the-Clean-Energy-Jobs-of-the-Future.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last September set a statewide target of zero carbon emissions from the electric sector by 2050. </span><a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/northam-lays-out-renewable-energy-goals-for-virginia-calls-for-carbon-free-electricity-by-2050/article_fdfc6afc-d41c-5024-8074-c4f381934a4a.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Challenge accepted,”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said a Dominion spokesman at the time, and in February of this year the company </span><a href="https://news.dominionenergy.com/2020-02-11-Dominion-Energy-Sets-New-Goal-of-Net-Zero-Emissions-by-2050" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">claimed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it was embracing a 2050 net-zero-carbon goal company-wide. A month later, passage of the Clean Economy Act moved the deadline up to 2045 for Dominion, keeping it at 2050 for utilities that lack Dominion’s head start of 30 percent nuclear power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s IRP, however, does not accept the challenge to get off fossil fuels. It rejects the challenge, directing a giant middle finger at the governor and the General Assembly. Dominion’s “preferred” plan keeps the utility’s existing fracked gas generating plants — currently 40 percent of its electric generation — operating through 2045. The IRP acknowledges this violates the law, so it argues against the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The IRP posits that if Dominion stops burning gas in Virginia, it will instead simply buy electricity from out of state, some of which will be generated by gas, and this will cost more money without reducing carbon emissions at the regional level. Better, then, to keep burning gas in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It gets worse. The IRP actually proposes increasing the number of gas combustion turbines in Dominion’s fleet. The VCEA imposes a two-year moratorium on new fossil fuel plants, so Dominion’s timetable has these gas peaker plants coming online in 2023 and 2024. The justification is vague; the IRP cites “probable” reliability problems related to adding a lot of solar, but it offers no analysis to back this up, much less any discussion of non-gas alternatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s flat-out refusal to abandon gas by 2045 poisons the rest of the document. The IRP is supposed to show a utility’s plans over a 15-year period, in this case up to 2035. And for those years, the IRP includes the elements of the VCEA that make money for Dominion: the build-out of solar, offshore wind and energy storage projects. It also includes money-saving retirements of outmoded coal, oil and biomass plants, as the VCEA requires. Heck, it even includes plans to close a coal plant the VCEA would allow to stay open in spite of its poor economic outlook (the Clover plant, half-owned by Old Dominion Electric Cooperative.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the IRP proposes no energy efficiency measures beyond those mandated by the VCEA between now and 2025. Dominion hates energy efficiency; it reduces demand, which is bad for business. So the company has made no effort to think deeply about how energy efficiency and other demand-side measures can support a zero-carbon grid — or, for that matter, how customer-owned solar can be made a part of the solution, rather than part of the problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t surprising: a plan that contemplates keeping gas plants around indefinitely looks very different, even in the first 15 years, from a plan that closes them all within 10 years after that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A company that really accepted the challenge of creating a zero-carbon energy supply would not just get creative in its own planning; it would look beyond generating and supplying electricity, at the larger universe of solutions. It would advocate for buildings constructed to need much less energy, including for heating and cooling, to lessen the seasonal peaks in energy demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would want the state to embrace strong efficiency standards. It would press its corporate and institutional customers to upgrade their facilities and operations to save energy, especially at times of peak demand. It would partner with communities to create microgrids. It would invest in innovation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, it would ask “How can we achieve our fossil-free goal?” instead of asking “How can we keep burning gas?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not hard to understand why Dominion clings to gas; its parent company is fighting desperately to keep the Atlantic Coast Pipeline project alive in the face of spiraling costs (now up to $8 billion), an increasingly uphill battle at the State Corporation Commission to stick utility ratepayers with the costs of a redundant gas supply contract and a dearth of other customers anywhere along the route.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is really hard to understand, though, is why Dominion chose to be quite so transparent in its disdain for the VCEA. Senator Jennifer McClellan and Delegate Rip Sullivan, both Democrats, who introduced the law and negotiated its terms with Dominion lobbyists and other stakeholders through many long days and nights, reacted to the IRP with entirely predictable outrage. In a </span><a href="https://bluevirginia.us/2020/05/sen-jennifer-mcclellan-del-rip-sullivan-urge-dominion-to-adhere-to-the-intent-of-the-virginia-clean-economy-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they responded:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The VCEA requires Virginia utilities to step up to the plate and be active leaders in carbon reduction. Dominion Energy’s IRP is tantamount to quitting the game before the first pitch is thrown. The law sets clear benchmarks for Virginia to reach 100 percent clean energy by 2045, not for utilities to plan to import carbon-polluting energy from West Virginia or Kentucky.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senator McClellan, it might be pointed out, <a href="https://www.richmond.com/news/plus/sen-jennifer-mcclellan-practical-progressive-readies-campaign-for-governor/article_dfc453b2-8bcf-5fa3-bc8c-5856adec050c.html" target="_blank">could be on her way</a> to becoming Virginia’s next governor. Most companies would hesitate to offend a leader of her stature, as well as such a prominent Democratic leader as Delegate Sullivan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that’s Dominion for you. It will rise to any challenge, as long as the challenge doesn’t require anything the company didn’t already want to do.</span></p>

Two weeks later, Virginia shut down in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the businesses whose very existence is now in peril are the energy efficiency companies and solar installers we will be counting on to get us off fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home weatherization and energy efficiency programs have come to an almost complete halt in Virginia, </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/energy-efficiency-efforts-are-shutting-down-due-to-covid-19-threatening-jo/575496/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">including programs run by Dominion Energy Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Nationwide, </span><a href="https://www.ase.org/blog/new-report-shows-efficiency-job-impacts-caused-covid-19" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the energy efficiency sector has lost almost 70,000 jobs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Meanwhile, companies that install solar, especially rooftop systems, report plummeting sales. The Solar Energy Industries Association reports that nationally, </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/coronavirus-information-resources" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">55 percent of solar workers are already laid off or suffering cutbacks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timing seems terrible — although to be fair, there’s no good time for an economy-crushing, worldwide pandemic. Eventually, however, the virus will run its course or be defeated through vaccine or cure. At that point, we will face a choice: we can stagger blinking out into the sunlight aimlessly wondering </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">now what?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or we can execute the well-developed plan we have spent these weeks and months formulating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s go with the second option. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, it’s worth remembering that nothing happening now will change the trajectory of clean energy. Solar and wind had banner years in 2019, continuing their steady march to dominance. Wind has become the </span><a href="https://electrek.co/2020/04/20/egeb-wind-electricity-iowa-kansas-austria-coal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest single source of electricity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in two states, Iowa and Kansas. The island of Kauai in Hawaii is now </span><a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/04/23/kauai-was-56-renewably-powered-in-2019/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">56 percent powered by renewable energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, mostly solar. Across the U.S. wind, solar and hydro produce </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1062928361" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more electricity than coal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wind is the cheapest form of new electric generation nationally; solar takes pride of place in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, fossil fuel is even more firmly on its way out. </span><a href="about:blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six of the top seven U.S. coal companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have gone into bankruptcy since 2015. That was before the lockdown sent energy demand down, further hurting </span><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/03/11/Foresight-Energy-is-latest-US-coal-miner-in-bankruptcy/stories/202003110061" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-priced coal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fracked gas helped kill coal but is itself vulnerable to price competition from renewables. Odd as it sounds, the collapse in oil prices </span><a href="http://v" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">will make natural gas more expensive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s because oil producers in Texas and North Dakota are closing wells that produced natural gas along with oil. The tightening supply of gas may finally make fracking companies in Appalachia profitable, but it means higher prices for utilities. Wind and solar will just keep looking better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Trump administration is still trying futilely to hold back the tide, but the U.S. will get a lot farther riding the wave than struggling against it. Congressional leaders should declare the country “all in” on clean energy. Instead of bailing out the highly polluting fossil fuel industries, they should put that money to work creating more jobs and economic development — and actually doing something about climate change — with energy efficiency and renewables.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congress should return the Investment Tax Credit for solar (and offshore wind) to the 30 percent level in effect last year and keep it there, instead of continuing the phase-out now in effect. Congress should also give solar owners the option of taking the credit as a cash grant, </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy09osti/45359.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as it did during the last recession</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and for the same reason: tax-based incentives are less useful in a recession, when companies can’t use the credits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner have a critical role to play in convincing their colleagues to support solar. So far neither is rising to the task. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the state level, Northam did the right thing in signing this year’s energy legislation, allowing utilities and industry members to start planning for the future. But the Clean Economy Act gets wind and solar off to a very slow start; Dominion doesn’t have to build Virginia solar for five years yet. And though the new laws remove many policy constraints on customer-sited solar, they offer next to nothing in the way of financial incentives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governor Northam should make it clear he intends to make rooftop solar a priority for next year, along with projects on closed landfills, former coal mine areas, and other brownfields, with a special focus on areas hardest-hit economically. He can also encourage corporations that do business in Virginia to meet their sustainability goals with Virginia wind and solar, starting right now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The governor should also prioritize building efficiency. Virginia will be adopting a new residential building code this year, and if past years are any indication, </span><a href="https://vaeec.org/building-code-updates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its energy efficiency provisions will fall short</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the most recent model code standard. It’s up to the governor to make sure Virginia adopts the full code. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Local governments are </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/news/education/fcps-using-down-time-to-catch-up-on-school-maintenance-repairs/article_f5dc2ff0-800f-11ea-b127-cb69095916b4.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already taking advantage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of suddenly-empty buildings to accelerate maintenance and repairs. But it’s a good time to think bigger, with new financing tools available that make energy efficiency retrofits and solar facilities cash-positive right from the start.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://vaeec.org/programs/energy-performance-contracting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy performance contracting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows the energy savings to pay for retrofits. The Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy keeps a list of pre-qualified energy service companies and </span><a href="https://www.dmme.virginia.gov/DE/PerformanceContractingSupport.shtml" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offers expertise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help local government employees navigate the process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s legislation also greatly expanded local governments’ ability to finance on-site solar through third-party power purchase agreements, effective July 1. The PPAs are structured so that a school district, municipality or any commercial or non-profit customer can have a solar array installed at no cost, paying just for the energy produced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, Fairfax County </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/environment-energy-coordination/cleanenergy/news/fairfax-county-awards-solar-power-purchase-agreement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">awarded contracts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for PPAs to install solar on more than a hundred sites, including schools and other government buildings. The county’s contract is “rideable,” which allows other counties and cities to piggyback, getting the same terms without the need for new contract negotiations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, local governments in southwest Virginia </span><a href="http://appvoices.org/2019/12/16/appalachian-power-restricts-solar-savings-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">are prevented from pursuing PPAs </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">— not by state legislation, which allows it starting July 1, but by a contract with Appalachian Power that governs their electricity purchases from the utility. The contract is up for renewal this year; disgracefully, APCo is refusing to agree to new terms allowing the localities to use solar PPAs. APCo should back off, and let local governments in economically depressed southwest Virginia start saving money and supporting solar jobs this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington County has gone beyond on-site solar, contracting for a share of a large solar farm in southern Virginia that will provide </span><a href="https://newsroom.arlingtonva.us/release/arlington-county-partners-with-dominion-energy-to-help-achieve-energy-goals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 80 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the electricity for county government operations. It’s a model any locality can adopt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia residents and businesses also have good reasons to focus on clean energy. The enforced down-time many people are experiencing means more time to research options, and companies are motivated to offer low prices on energy efficiency upgrades and rooftop solar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal government offers more generous </span><a href="https://www.energystar.gov/about/federal_tax_credits" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tax credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year than next. Credits for residential energy efficiency equipment and a deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings expire at the end of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment tax credit for solar (as well as for geothermal heat pumps, fuel cells and small wind turbines) stands at 26% for projects placed in operation this year, but it will drop to 22% in 2021. It falls to 10% for commercial customers and disappears altogether for residential customers in 2022. If Congress acts to raise the credit to 30%, buyers will get an even bigger boost. If it doesn’t, there will be a rush this year to get projects done by the end of the year, so customers should secure their place in line now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia nonprofits have helped hundreds of residents and businesses save money on solar and EV chargers through bulk purchasing programs. One has closed operations temporarily during the pandemic, but Virginia Solar United Neighbors just announced a series of virtual information sessions to promote the </span><a href="https://coops.solarunitedneighbors.org/coops/arlington-solar-ev-charger-co-op/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arlington Solar EV Co-op</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an ideal world, the U.S. would already be well along in executing a comprehensive plan for a clean energy transition, one that includes job retraining for workers, and that resists counterproductive efforts to save the fossil fuel industry. But we can do the next best thing, and use the tools of government, the market and consumer choice to speed us in the right direction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 has handed all of us a big, fat lemon. Let’s make some lemonade.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Democrats in charge, Virginia passed </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=2114&amp;action=edit" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a suite of bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that establish a sturdy framework for a transition to renewable energy in the electric sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> At the center of this transformation are the Clean Economy Act, HB1526/SB851, and the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act, HB981/SB1027. Other new laws direct further planning, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/18/new-laws-clear-away-barriers-to-small-solar-projects/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">make it easier for customers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to install solar, improve the process for siting wind and solar farms, and expand financing options for energy efficiency and renewable energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Ralph Northam has signed some bills already, and has until April 11 to sign the others or send them back to the General Assembly with proposed amendments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I assume he has other things on his mind right now than asking the General Assembly to tinker further with a bill like the Clean Economy Act that was tough to get across the finish line in the first place — but if he should want to, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/24/yeah-im-not-perfect-either-pass-the-clean-economy-act/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have suggestions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once signed, legislation takes effect on July 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what happens then? How does this all work? Let’s look at the way these major pieces of legislation will change the energy landscape in Virginia. </span></p>
<h2><b>Virginia joins RGGI, and CO2 emissions start to fall. </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality has already written the regulations that call for Virginia power plants to reduce emissions by 30 percent by 2030. The mechanism for achieving this involves Virginia trading with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a regional carbon cap and trade market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulations have been on hold as the result of a budget amendment passed last year, when Republicans still ruled the General Assembly. After July 1, DEQ will be able to implement the regulations, with the commonwealth participating in carbon allowance auctions as early as the last quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2021. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_6076" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-6076" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Coal fired units at Dominion Energy&#8217;s Chesterfield Power Station would close by 2024 under the Clean Economy Act that passed the General Assembly this year (Ryan M. Kelly/ For the Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to joining RGGI, the Clean Energy and Community Flood Preparedness Act also allows the commonwealth to earn money from the allowance auctions. The Department of Housing and Community Development will spend 50 percent of auction proceeds on “low-income efficiency programs, including programs for eligible housing developments.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Department of Conservation and Recreation will get 45 percent of the auction proceeds to fund flood preparedness and climate change planning and mitigation through the Virginia Community Flood Preparedness Fund. The last 5 percent of proceeds will cover administrative costs, including those for administering the auctions.</span></p>
<h2><b>Energy efficiency savings become mandatory, not just something to throw money at.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, the Grid Transformation and Security Act required Dominion and Appalachian Power to propose more than a billion dollars in energy efficiency spending over 10 years, but the law didn’t say the programs had to actually be effective in lowering electricity demand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year that changed. For the first time, Virginia will have an energy efficiency resource standard (EERS) requiring Dominion to achieve a total of 5 percent electricity savings by 2025 (using 2019 as the baseline); APCo must achieve a total of 2 percent savings. The SCC is charged with setting new targets after 2025. At least 15 percent of the costs must go to programs benefiting low-income, elderly or disabled individuals, or veterans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EERS comes on top of the low-income energy efficiency spending funded by RGGI auctions. </span></p>
<h2><b>Dominion and Appalachian Power ramp up renewables and energy storage. </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Clean Economy Act requires Dominion to build 16,100 megawatts of onshore wind and solar energy, and APCo to build 600 megawatts. The law also contains one of the strongest energy storage mandates in the country: 2,700 MW for Dominion, 400 MW for Appalachian Power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beginning in 2020, Dominion and Appalachian must submit annual plans to the SCC for new wind, solar and storage resources. We’ll have a first look at Dominion’s plans just a month from now: the SCC has told the company to take account of the Clean Economy Act and other new laws when it files its 2020 Integrated Resource Plan on May 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislation provides a strangely long lead time before the utilities must request approval of specific projects: by the end of 2023 for APCo (the first 200 MW) or 2024 for Dominion (the first 3,000 MW). But the build-out then becomes rapid, and the utilities must issue requests for proposals on at least an annual basis.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the solar and land-based wind, Dominion now has the green light for up to 3,000 MW of offshore wind from the project it is developing off Virginia Beach, and which it plans to bring online beginning in 2024. All told, the Clean Economy Act proclaims up to 5,200 MW of offshore wind by 2034 to be<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/03/virginia-explained-what-does-it-mean-to-be-in-the-public-interest-and-what-does-that-have-to-do-with-offshore-wind/" target="_blank"> in the public interest</a>. </span></p>
<h2><b>Dominion’s plans for new gas plants come to a screeching halt.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the 2020 legislative session, Dominion’s Integrated Resource Plan included plans for as many as 14 new gas combustion turbines to be built in pairs beginning in 2022. In December, the company announced plans to build </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/trending/jsani_phxeqrxaudk3hqia2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four gas peaking units</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> totaling nearly 1,000 MW, to come online in 2023 and 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that was then, and this is now. The Clean Economy Act prohibits the SCC from issuing a certificate of convenience and necessity for any carbon-emitting generating plant until at least January 1, 2022, when the secretaries of natural resources and commerce and trade submit a report to the General Assembly “on how to achieve 100 percent carbon-free electric energy generation by 2045 at least cost to ratepayers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even with no further moratorium, Dominion will find it hard to sell the SCC on the need for new gas plants on top of all the renewable energy and energy storage mandated in the Clean Economy Act. Solar and battery storage together do the same job that a gas peaker would have done — but they are required, and the gas peaker is not. Meanwhile, the energy efficiency provisions of the act mean demand should start going down, not up. </span></p>
<h2><b>Fossil fuel and biomass plants start closing.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2024, the Clean Economy Act requires the closure of all Dominion or APCo-owned oil-fueled generating plants over 500 MW and all coal units other than Dominion’s Virginia City Hybrid plant in Wise County and the Clover Station that Dominion co-owns with Old Dominion Electric Cooperative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This mandate is less draconian than it sounds; it forces the closure of just two coal units, both at Dominion’s Chesterfield plant. Other Dominion coal plants have already been retired or switched to using gas or biomass. Oil-fired peaking units at </span><a href="https://wydaily.com/local-news/2019/03/18/no-more-coal-yorktown-power-station-units-1-2-shut-down-after-power-line-energizes/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yorktown</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/trending/gY0PlJNfL3FW6EfXbjw9iQ2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Possum Point</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were already slated for retirement in 2021 and 2022. APCo owns no coal or biomass plants in Virginia. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2028, Dominion’s biomass plants must shut down. All other carbon-emitting generating units in Virginia owned by Dominion and APCo must close by 2045, including the Virginia City plant and all the gas plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 2050, no carbon allowances can be awarded to any generating units that emit carbon dioxide, including those owned by the coops and merchant generators, with an exception for units under 25 MW as well as units bigger than 25 MW (if they are owned by politically well-connected multinational paper companies with highly-paid lobbyists). </span></p>
<h2><b>Solar on schools and other buildings becomes the new normal.</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December, Fairfax County </span><a href="https://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/environment-energy-coordination/cleanenergy/news/fairfax-county-awards-solar-power-purchase-agreement" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">awarded contracts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the installation of solar on up to 130 county-owned schools and other sites, one of the largest such awards in the nation. Using a financing approach called a third-party power purchase agreement (PPA), the county would get the benefits of solar without having to spend money upfront. The contracts were written to be rideable, meaning other Virginia jurisdictions could piggyback on them to achieve cost savings and lower greenhouse gas emissions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County’s projects, along with others across the state, hit a wall when, on Jan. 7, the SCC announced that the 50 MW program cap for PPAs in Dominion territory </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/27/as-schools-look-to-solar-existing-state-law-shuts-down-further-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">had been reached</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But with the passage of the Clean Economy Act and Solar Freedom legislation, customers will be able to install up to 1,000 MW worth of solar PPAs in Dominion territory and 40 MW in APCo territory. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fairfax County schools will soon join their counterparts in at least 10 other jurisdictions across the state that have already installed solar. With the PPA cap no longer a barrier, and </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/18/new-laws-clear-away-barriers-to-small-solar-projects/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several other barriers also removed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, local governments will increasingly turn to solar to save money and shrink their carbon footprints.   </span></p>
<h2><b>Virginia agencies start working on decarbonizing the rest of the economy. </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In spite of its name, the Clean Economy Act really only tackles the electric sector, with a little spillover into home weatherization. That still leaves three-quarters of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions to be addressed in transportation, buildings, agriculture and industry. Ridding these sectors of greenhouse gas emissions requires different tools and policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other legislation passed this session starts that planning process. </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB94" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB94</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Favola) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb714&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB714</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Reid) establish a policy for the commonwealth to achieve net-zero emissions economy-wide by 2045 (2040 for the electric sector) and require the next Virginia Energy Plan, due in 2022, to identify actions towards achieving the goal. Depending on who the next governor is, we may see little or nothing in the way of new proposals, or we may see proposals for transportation and home electrification, deep building retrofits, net-zero homes and office buildings, carbon sequestration on farm and forest land and innovative solutions for replacing fossil fuels in industrial use. </span></p>
<h2><b>Collateral effects will drive greenhouse gas emissions even lower.</b></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Proposed new merchant gas plants are likely to go away.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With Virginia joining RGGI and all fossil fuel generating plants required to pay for the right to spew carbon pollution, the developers of two huge new merchant gas plants proposed for Charles City County will likely take their projects to some other state, if they pursue them at all. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither the 1,600 MW Chickahominy Power Station and the 1,050 C4GT plant a mile away planned to sell power to Virginia utilities; their target is the regional wholesale market, which currently rewards over-building of gas plant capacity even in the absence of demand. The Chickahominy and C4GT developers sought an exemption from RGGI through legislation; the bill passed the Senate but got shot down in the House. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other coal plants will close</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although the CEA only requires Dominion to retire two coal units at its Chesterfield Power Station, other coal plants in the state will close by the end of this decade, too. That’s because the economics are so heavily against coal these days that it was just a matter of time before their owners moved to close them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding the cost of carbon allowances under RGGI will speed the process along. That includes the Clover Station, which Dominion owns in partnership with Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (ODEC), and the Virginia City Hybrid Electric plant in Wise County, Dominion’s most expensive coal plant, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/05/the-wise-county-coal-plant-should-never-have-been-built-why-fight-to-keep-it-open/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">which should never have been built.</span></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley Pipelines find themselves in more trouble than ever</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If I had a dollar for every time a Dominion or Mountain Valley spokesperson said, “Our customers desperately need this pipeline,” I would not be worried about the stock market right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The fact is that no one was ever sure who those customers might be, other than affiliates of the pipeline owners themselves—and that doesn’t exactly answer the question. With Virginia now on a path away from all fossil fuels, neither pipeline has a path to profitability inside Virginia any longer, if they ever had one. </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia General Assembly members have an expression for when opposing interests agree on a bill: they call it “peace in the valley.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The phrase comes from a gospel song by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_A._Dorsey" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas A. Dorsey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, written for Mahalia Jackson and then later sung by a bunch of white guys including Red Foley and Elvis Presley. The lyrics, </span><a href="https://www.staugustine.com/article/20150501/LIFESTYLE/305019979" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">written on the eve of World War II</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, speak of a longing for the peace of the afterlife, where “the bear will be gentle, the wolf will be tame, and the lion will lay down by the lamb.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not sure the General Assembly has ever inspired anything quite so wonderful as the song describes. More typically, a legislator uses the expression to indicate that a bunch of special interests, having duked it out amongst themselves, have now each gotten everything they thought they could get out of negotiations and so are offering up a compromise that legislators can adopt without having to trouble themselves too much with the details. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, not exactly the peace of God, but still a pretty good state of affairs from the point of view of committee members who have thirty or forty other bills to deal with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peace rarely used to characterize bills supporting distributed solar generation. The lion had no reason to lie down by the lamb. Indeed, more typically the lamb was lunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the November election shifted the balance of power in the General Assembly. At first it wasn’t clear how much power the lion and bear were going to have to cede. In fact, no one is quite sure even now where the balance of power lies, even after weeks of intense skirmishing finally produced the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/24/yeah-im-not-perfect-either-pass-the-clean-economy-act/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">flawed but-still-transformational</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Clean Economy Act. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/03/06/virginia-clean-economy-act-clears-general-assembly-aided-by-beefed-up-ratepayer-protections/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the parties all claimed victory, but anyone who thinks there might be peace in the energy valley is advised to stick around for next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The skirmishing over distributed solar was decidedly less intense. Advocates and utilities achieved peace on a number of provisions removing barriers to rooftop solar, dramatically increasing program caps for third-party power purchase agreements (PPAs), raising the net metering cap, establishing shared solar programs, and making it easier for customers in homeowner’s associations to install solar.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much work remains. Removing barriers is a necessary first step, but now the challenge is to make small-scale solar a priority for Virginia. The Clean Economy Act focused on cheap utility-scale projects, but an economy that runs primarily on renewables needs solar on places other than farmland. Getting to 100 percent carbon-free energy means putting solar on as many sunny homes and businesses as possible—not to mention government buildings, warehouses, data centers, parking lots, highway rest areas, closed landfills, brownfields, former mining sites and vacant land around airports. </span></p>

<h2><b>Solar Freedom and the Clean Economy Act</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final version of the</span> Solar Freedom bill<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb572" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB572</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Keam) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb710" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB710</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">(McClellan), made eight changes affecting customers of investor-owned utilities. Customers of electric cooperatives are excluded; a law passed last year addressed many of these issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• It raises the cap on the total amount of net metered solar allowed from 1 percent currently to 6 percent (broken out as 1 percent for low and moderate income customers and 5 percent for everyone else). This means customers installing rooftop solar will continue getting credit for surplus energy at the retail rate. When net-metered projects reach 3 percent, or in 2024 for APCo or 2025 for Dominion, the State Corporation Commission will conduct a solar study to determine the appropriate rate structure for new net metering customers. Existing net metering customers will not be affected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• It raises the program cap on third-party power purchase agreements (PPAs). PPAs are the financing mechanism that schools, local governments, universities and other customers have been using to install solar on-site with no money down. The original program cap of 50 MW in Dominion territory was reached this fall, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/27/as-schools-look-to-solar-existing-state-law-shuts-down-further-development/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">halting projects across the state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In Dominion territory, the limit will now go to 500 MW for jurisdictional customers (that’s most people) and 500 MW for non-jurisdictional customers (including local governments and public schools). The new cap in Appalachian Power territory is 40 MW for all customers, and there will be no limit in Old Dominion Power (Kentucky Utilities) territory. In addition, the legislation broadens who can take advantage of this program to any tax-exempt customer, and all other customers with projects over 50 kW.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• It increases the allowable size of net-metered commercial projects from 1 MW today to 3 MW.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• It increases the allowable size of residential net-metered projects to 25 kW, from 20 kW today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• It removes standby charges for residential customers with solar facilities of less than 15 kW in Dominion territory, and removes them entirely for customers of Appalachian Power and Old Dominion Power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• It allows residents of apartment buildings and condominiums in Dominion Energy and Old Dominion Power territories to share the output of on-site solar facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• In Dominion territory, it allows customers to install enough solar to meet 150 percent of their previous year’s demand, recognizing the needs of growing families and EV owners. In APCo territory the limit remains at 100 percent of previous demand.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Finally, it allows Fairfax County to move forward on a 5 MW solar project on a closed landfill, with the electricity serving government facilities. This will be the first such project in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar Freedom overlaps with the </span>Clean Economy Act<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=hb15266" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1526</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Sullivan) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb851" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB851</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (McClellan), on several of these provisions, including the net metering cap and PPAs. The Clean Economy Act also creates a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) focused on utility-scale projects, but with a small carve-out for distributed “wind, solar and anaerobic digestion resources of one megawatt or less located in the Commonwealth.” The carve-out is limited to 1 percent of Dominion’s RPS targets. This level is so modest it probably won’t act as a market stimulus, especially for projects not owned by Dominion itself, and the addition of anaerobic digestion should give anyone pause. Also, there is no carve-out in APCo territory. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The failure of the Clean Economy Act to drive small-scale solar growth is a missed opportunity that will need to be addressed in the future if the General Assembly truly wants to achieve a clean energy economy. I recommend taking away the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/24/yeah-im-not-perfect-either-pass-the-clean-economy-act/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">appalling subsidies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for paper companies and letting those millions fund distributed solar. </span></p>
<h2><b>Community solar</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The provision in Solar Freedom that allows residents of multifamily buildings to share onsite solar arrays looks favorable to customers but requires an SCC proceeding this year to determine the bill credit rate for subscribers. The rate “shall be set such that the shared solar program results in robust project development and shared solar program access for all customer classes.” Further, “the Commission shall annually calculate the applicable bill credit rate as the effective retail rate of the customer’s rate class, which shall be inclusive of all supply charges, delivery charges, demand charges, fixed charge, and any applicable riders or other charges to the customer.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the Solar Freedom provision is restricted to multifamily residential buildings, the General Assembly also passed legislation more generally allowing for third-party owned community solar, rebranded as “shared solar.” </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB629" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB629</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Surovell) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1634" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1634</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Jones) instruct the SCC to set up a shared solar program for customers of Dominion and Old Dominion Power by Jan. 1, 2021. Shared solar projects must be no larger than 5 MW, can be owned by any for profit or nonprofit entity, and require at least three subscribers. The program is capped at a total of 150 MW, with an additional 50 MW possible if the utility demonstrates that 45 MW of shared solar has gone to low-income consumers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The success of a shared solar program ultimately depends on whether project owners can make money and customers can save money. It remains to be seen whether that will happen. The provisions in these bills are less favorable to customers than the multifamily solar provisions of Solar Freedom. Customers will have to pay a minimum bill amount (waived for low-income customers), and there is no requirement that the bill credit rate be set at a rate than results in “robust project development.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB573" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB573</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Keam) requires that community solar projects owned by investor-owned utilities must include higher-cost facilities located in low-income areas. </span></p>
<h2><b>Homeowner associations</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another successful piece of legislation is </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB414" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB414</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Delaney) and </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB504" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB504</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Petersen), clarifying the respective rights of homeowners and HOAs when it comes to solar panels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2014, Virginia law has prohibited HOAs from banning solar panels unless the ban appears in the association’s recorded declaration. However, the law respects the right of HOAs to place “reasonable restrictions” on the size, place, and manner of placement of solar facilities on members’ property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that the law did not define “reasonable” turned out to be a problem. Some HOAs decided it was “reasonable” to insist solar panels be confined to the rear of a roof, whether there was sunshine back there or not. The result has been acrimony, added expense and blocked projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aaron Sutch of </span><a href="https://www.solarunitedneighbors.org/virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar United Neighbors of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> estimates that since the 2014 legislation, HOAs have blocked over 300 Virginia installations with a value of over $6 million. Sutch negotiated with lobbyists for homeowners associations to achieve peace in this particular valley. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new legislation provides that a restriction is not reasonable if it increases the cost of installation of the solar panels by 5 percent over the projected cost of the initially proposed installation, or reduces the energy production by 10 percent below the projected production. The owner must provide documentation prepared by an independent solar panel design specialist to show that the restriction is not reasonable by these criteria.</span></p>
<h2><b>Other legislation</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few other bills should help customers finance solar panels. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB654" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B654</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Guy) authorizes DMME to sponsor a statewide financing program for commercial solar, energy efficiency and stormwater investments. The effect will be to boost the availability of low-interest financing through Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) in areas of the state where the locality has not developed a program of its own. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB754" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B754</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Marsden) authorizes (though it does not require) electric cooperatives to establish on-bill financing of energy efficiency and renewable energy. The program allows for the costs to be paid for out of the savings these improvements deliver. The coops asked for this authority, so presumably at least one plans to follow through. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb542&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">B542</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Edwards) repeals the sunset date on crowdfunding provisions and provides fixes for obstacles to a financing approach that, to my knowledge, has been </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2019/10/20/first-solar-crowdfunding-campaign-launches-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">used only once</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for solar projects in Virginia. </span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/20/ten-things-to-know-about-the-clean-economy-act/" target="_blank">Virginia Clean Economy Act</a> continues to bump along towards the finish line, losing pieces of itself but picking up new and different features as it makes its tortuous way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most recently, and disconcertingly, Republicans representing southwest Virginia persuaded the Senate <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/02/28/senate-removes-southwest-va-coal-plant-from-list-of-clean-economy-act-closures/" target="_blank">to remove</a> a key provision requiring the closure of the Virginia City coal plant in Wise County by 2030, unless it reduces its carbon emissions by 83% through the carbon capture technology it was designed for. The change would undermine the carefully-negotiated pathway to a zero-carbon electric sector.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday the House rejected the Senate version of the bill that would have allowed the plant to continue operating until 2050. The Senate will have the final say, but it can only save the coal plant by killing the legislation altogether. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s understandable that senators want to please everyone, or at least everyone with a lobbying presence at the General Assembly building. Yet the case for keeping the coal plant running is built on a lie — indeed, on a history of lies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coal champions call the Wise County facility “the cleanest coal plant in the country,” a claim that, at best, misses the devastating environmental and human impacts of coal mining itself. More to the point right now, the claim ignores the fact that the facility emits millions of tons of CO2 every year, the very reason it needs to be retired by 2030 in order for the Clean Economy Act to deliver on its carbon-cutting mission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while coalfield Republicans emphasize the coal plant’s economic benefits to the region, the fact is that the plant never made sense economically and should never have been built. Trying to keep it running will simply burden ratepayers further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2007, when it sought permission from the State Corporation Commission to build the plant, Dominion projected the cost of the electricity it would generate at $93 per megawatt-hour. Yes, that’s high. Even 13 years later, wind, solar and combined cycle gas still come in at under $40.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worse, Dominion based its cost on a projection that the plant would run at 90 percent of its full capacity. It never did. The plant is running at only 24 percent today. If Dominion had accurately represented that the capacity percentage would not exceed the mid-60s and would plummet into the 20s a mere seven years after it entered service, the cost projection would have been a good deal higher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC only granted Dominion </span><a href="http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/1_rg01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">permission</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build the plant for a reason that will sound familiar to anyone following the debate over the Clean Economy Act: The General Assembly passed a law proclaiming construction of a coal plant in southwest Virginia “in the public interest,” removing the SCC’s authority to make that determination. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, the General Assembly’s habit of bossing the SCC around with these magic words goes back quite a ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Legislators weren’t the only ones championing the coal plant back in 2007. In her book </span><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/climate-capitulation" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Climate of Capitulation</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, retired University of Virginia professor and former State </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Air Pollution Control Board member Vivian Thomson describes how then-Gov. Tim Kaine put enormous pressure on the Air Board to approve the air permit for the facility. Not incidentally, Dominion’s chief lobbyist, Bill Murray, worked for Kaine during these years, before he made his way through the revolving door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has sometimes suggested that it pursued the coal plant only as a favor to legislators. I asked Thomson about that in a phone call. She responded that on the contrary, the plant is a prime example of how Virginia Democrats and Republicans alike have capitulated to Dominion’s interests over the years.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps Dominion was angling for some pot-sweetening through a show of reluctance. The General Assembly obliged, of course, promising Dominion a higher rate of return than usual. And indeed, the SCC eventually granted Dominion an enhanced rate of return of 12.12%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC’s approval of the plant outraged consumers and environmentalists alike. Attorney Cale Jaffe, a UVA law professor who represented environmental groups in the SCC proceeding, says it was a bad decision even in the years before Virginia committed to reduce climate pollution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All of the concerns and risks associated with the project in 2006-2007 were fully debated and apparent to everyone,” he told me. “The fact that we would be moving to a low-carbon economy made building a coal plant and locking yourself in for decades a risky strategy. The carbon emissions should have led people to look at other options for generating electricity that don’t emit 5.3 million tons of carbon every year.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s remarkable that even today, with coal plants closing across the country and mining companies going bankrupt, legislators from southwest Virginia still can’t bring themselves to break with the industry that has polluted their land and water and shattered their communities. The Sierra Club and its allies tried for years to persuade the General Assembly to </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2012/11/03/coal-and-the-big-lie/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redirect millions of dollars annually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in coal subsidies, urging that the money could have underwritten thousands of new jobs in a more diverse economy. Legislators </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2015/02/06/and-the-coal-gravy-train-rolls-on/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">kept throwing taxpayer money</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at coal companies anyway, always with the full support of Dominion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, when it comes to the Clean Economy Act, Dominion wants to have it both ways. During negotiations, the company agreed to the coal plant closures as part of a deal that gave it cost recovery for offshore wind, energy efficiency targets significantly lower than what advocates originally sought, and numerous other concessions. But it turns out company lobbyists were simultaneously working to undermine the compromise bill by encouraging southwest Virginia legislators to push for coal industry protections.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senators should have none of it. They’ve promised Virginians a bill that responds to the climate crisis by putting the commonwealth on its way to a clean energy future. Today, it’s time to deliver. </span></p>

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it was first introduced, and before the utilities and special interests got their grubby little paws on it, the Clean Economy Act was an ambitious and far-reaching overhaul of Virginia energy policy that </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/14/both-this-sessions-big-energy-omnibus-bills-could-be-bolstered-with-amendments/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turned a little timid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when it came to particulars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sausage-making ensued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill that emerged from the grinder inevitably allows Dominion Energy to profit more than it should. (Welcome to Virginia, newcomers.) The energy efficiency provisions, which I thought weak, became even weaker, then became stronger, then ended up somewhere in the middle depending on whether you were looking at the </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+HB1526EH1+pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+SB851S1+pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> version. The renewable portfolio standard, complicated to begin with, is now convoluted to the point of farce — and to the extent I understand it, I’m not laughing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the bill still does what climate advocates set out to do: It creates a sturdy framework for a transition to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045 (the House bill) or 2050 (the Senate bill). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth taking a moment to marvel at the very idea of a strong energy transition bill passing in a state that still subsidizes coal mining. Even a year ago, this would not have been possible. That we have come this far is a tribute not just to the Democrats who are making good on their pledge to tackle climate, but to the thousands of grassroots activists who worked to elect them and then stayed on the job to hold them to their promises. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Clean Economy Act works by tackling the problem from multiple directions in a belt-and-suspenders approach: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• The legislation puts an immediate two-year moratorium on any new carbon-emitting plants. The concept came straight from the grassroots-led Green New Deal, and it creates space for the other provisions to kick in.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• It requires DEQ to implement regulations cutting carbon emissions through participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. RGGI uses market incentives to cut carbon emissions from power plants 30 percent by 2030. The Department of Environmental Quality will auction carbon allowances to power plant owners and use the auction money primarily for coastal resilience projects and energy efficiency projects for low-income residents. The Department of Housing and Community Development will be in charge of this efficiency spending, not Dominion.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• The Clean Economy Act takes RGGI out further, ensuring that Virginia reaches zero emissions by 2045 (House bill) or 2050 (Senate bill). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• It requires the closure of most coal plants in Virginia by the end of 2024. The newest of these, the Virginia City Hybrid coal plant, must close by the end of 2030 unless it achieves 83 percent emission reductions through carbon capture and storage, the technology it was allegedly designed for. Biomass plants have to close by the end of 2028.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• In place of fossil fuels, utilities have to build or buy thousands of megawatts of solar, on-shore wind, offshore wind and energy storage. Yearly solicitations for wind and solar will ensure sustained job creation employing thousands of workers. Thirty-five percent of all this must be competitively procured from third-party developers, a requirement that lowers costs and makes it harder for utilities to overcharge for the projects they build themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• The storage requirement in particular is notable because batteries compete directly with gas combustion turbines to serve peak demand. The more storage a utility builds, the weaker its case for building new gas peakers becomes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• For the first time, Virginia utilities will have to achieve energy efficiency savings, not just throw money at the problem. Under the stronger House bill, Dominion must achieve 5 percent cumulative energy savings by 2025. Appalachian Power must achieve 2 percent. Starting in 2026, the SCC will set efficiency goals every three years. Achieving savings ought to be easy; a </span><a href="https://www.aceee.org/research-report/u2004" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new ranking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of progress on efficiency puts Dominion at 50</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> out of 52 utilities. Low-hanging fruit, anyone? The Clean Economy Act also calls for 15 percent of efficiency spending to be allocated for programs benefiting low-income, elderly, disabled individuals and veterans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• Also for the first time, the legislation requires the State Corporation Commission to consider the “social cost of carbon.” That puts one more thumb on the scales weighing against fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">• If by January of 2028 we are still not on track, the House bill empowers the secretaries of natural resources and commerce and trade to put a second moratorium on new fossil fuel facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One other element of the bill is worth mentioning, given the questions about how much all these new projects and programs will cost. The legislation creates a “percentage of income payment program” for low-income ratepayers to cap electricity costs at 6 percent of household income, or 10 percent if they use electric heat. The program includes provisions for home energy audits and retrofits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I said at the outset, the bill is not without its flaws. The cost of offshore wind energy is “capped” in the bill at 1.6 times the cost of energy from a gas peaker plant, though I’m told negotiations continue and the adder may be reduced. Regardless of the number, this makes as much sense as capping the cost of apples at some number above the cost of Cheetos. Why are we comparing a carbon-free source of energy that is getting cheaper every year with one of the dirtiest and most expensive fossil fuel sources? On behalf of the offshore wind industry: Please, I’m insulted. </span></p>

(Stock photo via Getty Images)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia will be a leader on offshore wind, but we are not the first, and we know the price of electricity from the other U.S. projects already under contract. </span><a href="https://mailchi.mp/offshorewindus/december-2019-windblast-1244375?e=2dd76a4fd4" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are already well below gas peaker plant levels. The CEA ought to cap the cost of the Virginia project at 10 or 20 percent above the lowest-priced comparable offshore wind project, which would allow plenty of room for differences in wind speeds, distance from shore and other variables. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On second thought, as a point of pride, Dominion should reject any adder at all, and insist on capping its costs below those of all the northeastern projects. Have some confidence in yourselves, people!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My other complaint is that the Clean Economy Act’s nearly incomprehensible renewable portfolio standard fails to deliver. Yes, other provisions of the bill require the utilities to build a lot of wind and solar. But nothing requires them to use the renewable energy certificates (RECs) associated with those facilities for the RPS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I totally lost you with those acronyms, it’s okay. Just know that RECs are the bragging rights associated with renewable energy, and they can be bought and sold separately from the electricity itself. If Dominion builds a solar farm in Virginia and sells the RECs to Microsoft or the good people of New Jersey, those folks have bought the right to claim the renewable energy regardless of whether they actually get their electrons straight from the solar farm. Virginia would be left with a solar farm, but legally, no solar energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RECs also fetch different prices according to the kind of renewable energy they represent and how many are on the market. Everyone wants solar, so solar RECs cost more. RECs from hundred-year-old hydroelectric projects are not in demand, so they are cheap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As written now, the Clean Economy Act sets up an RPS that doesn’t require any wind or solar RECs at all (excepting a miniscule carve-out for small wind and solar that can also be met with “anaerobic digestion resources,” possibly a reference to pig manure). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RPS can be met with RECs from several sources less desirable than solar, and therefore cheaper. These include old hydro dams, Virginia-based waste-to-energy and landfill methane facilities and biomass burned by paper companies WestRock and International Paper. As a result, utilities will buy RECs from those sources to meet the requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only once utilities run out of cheaper RECs from eligible sources will they be forced to apply RECs from any of the wind and solar they are building. Until that time, Dominion and APCo will sell the RECs from the new solar farms to the highest bidder, while Virginia customers shell out potentially hundreds of millions of dollars for RECs no one really wants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not fair to the Virginians who are paying for the wind and solar projects to be built and who have a right to expect wind and solar will be a part of their energy supply as a result. Legislators can correct this with a very simple requirement that RECs from the new facilities mandated by the law be applied to the RPS. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, while I am telling legislators what to do, they ought to remove the eligibility of paper company biomass. This provision seems to have been added to the bill (in obscure, coded language) simply because WestRock has talented lobbyists and the political power to demand a cut of the action. But do we ratepayers want to buy their RECs? No, we do not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WestRock is doubtless unhappy about losing the nice stream of unearned income it’s been getting from selling </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/07/the-strange-case-of-thermal-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">thermal RECs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Dominion under Virginia’s voluntary RPS. But there is no good reason for electricity customers to subsidize a Fortune 500 corporation whose CEO earned $18 million last year and whose Covington mill, according to EPA data, spews out more toxic air emissions than any other facility in Virginia including Dominion’s Chesterfield coal plant. That’s not clean energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately (I guess), the RPS is not the heart and soul of the Clean Economy Act. For the next several years, its slow ramp-up makes it barely even relevant, and it is the next several years that matter most in our response to the climate crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining RGGI, cutting emissions, implementing energy efficiency, building renewable energy and storage, closing coal and biomass plants: those are the mechanisms of the Clean Economy Act that will drive Virginia’s transition to 100% clean energy.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, having offered my helpful suggestions to improve the nutritional content of this sausage, I will add just one more thing: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pass the bill.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After years of talking big but delivering little in the way of carbon reductions and clean energy, the General Assembly is under pressure to finally deliver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of the initial focus and discussion so far has been on two very different omnibus bills, the Clean Economy Act and the Green New Deal Act. But dozens of other bills also aim to reform Virginia energy law in ways both big (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB206" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">breaking up the monopolies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) and small (clarifying </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB504" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HOAs’ abilities to regulate solar panels</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) — and everything in between (</span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB572" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">removing barriers to customer solar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB1295" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">taxing fossil fuel investments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the coming days I’ll post summaries of many of these bills on my blog, </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Powerforthepeopleva.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But for now, let’s take a look at the two omnibus bills that have energized so many activists. Both have their strong points; both would benefit from strengthening amendments. </span></p>
<h2><b>The Clean Economy Act</b></h2>
<p><a href="http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?201+sum+HB1526" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB1526</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax) and </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=201&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb851&amp;submit=GO" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB851</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Sen. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond) are the Clean Economy Act put forward by a coalition of renewable energy industry and environmental groups. This is a massive bill, running to 37 pages and covering diverse aspects of the electric sector, and yet it is also surprisingly restrained in its ambitions.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEA’s goal is a zero-carbon electricity supply by 2050, a goal that allows nuclear energy to keep its role in the mix, and also one that, after an initial kick, requires a ramp-up of renewable energy of only 3% per year from 2021 to 2050. Utilities also must achieve </span>energy efficiency<span style="font-weight: 400;"> savings that start slow and creep upwards to a top rate of 2% per year in 2027; utilities generally can’t build new generation unless they first meet the efficiency targets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The very modest pace of the required investments in renewable energy and efficiency leaves no room for utilities to argue that the targets cannot be met or will cause economic pain. On the contrary, critics can justly complain they are too easy. On the other hand, the bill has lots of elements utilities still won’t like, including an energy storage mandate, community solar, net metering reforms and a limited moratorium on new fossil fuel generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill includes provisions for joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">o reduce statewide electric sector carbon emissions 30% by 2030, in accordance with DEQ’s regulations finalized last year. The state would auction carbon allowances, with 50% of proceeds funding energy efficiency programs for low-income, disability, veteran and elderly residents; 16% going to energy efficiency measures on state and local property; 30% for coastal resilience; and 4% for administrative costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The renewable portfolio standard </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">provisions look more complicated than they are, but even so, understanding what’s going on is not a job for the meek. First off, note that the RPS only applies to “total electric energy,” which does not mean, you know, total electric energy. The code defines the term to mean total electric energy minus electricity produced by nuclear power. Since nuclear provides about </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=VA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30% of Virginia’s electric generation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that means the RPS percentages look 30% bigger than they really are. (This is a neat trick Dominion devised years ago to make our voluntary RPS sound more meaningful. People fell for it, which is why our voluntary RPS is widely described as targeting 15% renewable energy by 2025 instead of about 10%.) </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_2627" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mercury-40.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2627" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mercury-40.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mercury-40.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mercury-40-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mercury-40-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mercury-40-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mercury-40-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mercury-40-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/mercury-40-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dominion Energy&#8217;s North Anna Nuclear Power Station in Louisa County. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the nominal RPS goal of 41% by 2030 does not mean that Virginia would get 41% of its electricity from renewable energy by 2030. The true percentage would be 41% of 70%, or — oh Lord, now I have to do math — somewhat under 30%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not incidentally, 30% by 2030 is </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/09/27/a-closer-look-at-a-cascade-of-clean-energy-announcements-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the renewable energy target Governor Ralph Northam set</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in his Executive Order 43 back in September, and that squares pretty well with Dominion’s building plans. (The CEA, however, strives mightily to ensure that less expensive independent developers get a good share of the business.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The drafters of the Clean Economy Act also chose not to change the code’s existing kitchen-sink definition of renewable energy, foregoing an opportunity to fix the mischief Dominion has got up to lately with what I call its </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/08/green-power-for-suckers-program-gets-scc-approval/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Power for Suckers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program and the </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/01/07/the-strange-case-of-thermal-energy/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great Thermal REC Boondoggle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead, the RPS provisions exclude biomass and sometimes waste, then limit which specific technologies qualify for each tier of the RPS. The result is that even without changing the definition of renewable energy, biomass and thermal RECs have no place in the CEA mix, municipal waste incineration is limited to existing facilities and old hydro dams will cease to qualify when their contracts run out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system of tiers also allows the CEA to prioritize among technologies and project sizes. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offshore wind has its own tier beginning in 2027, as well as detailed instructions for how it will be developed. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tier II covers distributed (under 3 MW) Virginia-based wind, solar and anaerobic digestion (presumably meaning biogas from things like </span><a href="https://www.smithfieldfoods.com/turning-manure-into-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pig manure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, reflecting </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/business/dp-nw-pig-manure-methane-20191104-ar2mkv5cqrdvjlgrm32puop2bi-story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s deal with Smithfield Foods</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). This tier is divided into sub-tiers that ensure smaller projects are represented, and 10% of each tier is supposed to be sourced from projects serving low-to-moderate income persons. This tier begins at 3% of the RPS total in 2021, increasing to 9% in 2028, and then bouncing around strangely between 7 and 9% thereafter. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tier III can be met with Virginia wind, solar, wave, tidal, geothermal or energy from waste (poorly defined, but with a limit on the number of eligible RECs that, I’m told, just covers the output of existing waste incinerators in Virginia), or landfill gas (also from existing landfills and with a limit). These projects don’t have a size limit. Utilities are instructed to issue annual requests for proposals to acquire Tier III resources. Tier III begins at 30% of the RPS, gets as high as 43% in 2030, and then declines as offshore wind in Tier I takes a greater share. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tier IV can be met with <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenpower/renewable-energy-certificates-recs" target="_blank">renewable energy certificates</a> from wind, solar and some hydro sources inside or outside Virginia, but within the PJM, the regional transmission organization that coordinates the electric grid in all or parts of 13 states, including Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Tier IV starts at 38% of the RPS total, goes as high as 51% in 2023, and then declines by fits and starts until it is less than 20% in the out years. </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fifth tier consists of the old hydro RECs from PJM with existing purchase contracts. These begin at a whopping 29% of the total but decline rapidly to 6% in 2023 and even less thereafter. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar installers who focus on Virginia may be dismayed by the modesty of the in-state requirements. Only Tier II serves distributed generation, and all its sub-tiers and low-income provisions don’t make up for the fact that distributed generation must account for less than 0.3% of total statewide demand in 2021 (3% of the initial 14% goal, adjusted downward for nuclear). This may well be less than the amount of net-metered solar we will have then anyway, with or without the CEA. By 2030, distributed renewables would still account for less than 2.5% of total generation in Virginia, a far cry from the 25% or more that </span><a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65586.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown is possible. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_11780" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1000px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sun-Tribe-Solar-Mercury-OpEd-Photo.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-11780" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sun-Tribe-Solar-Mercury-OpEd-Photo.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sun-Tribe-Solar-Mercury-OpEd-Photo.jpg 1000w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sun-Tribe-Solar-Mercury-OpEd-Photo-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sun-Tribe-Solar-Mercury-OpEd-Photo-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sun-Tribe-Solar-Mercury-OpEd-Photo-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Sun-Tribe-Solar-Mercury-OpEd-Photo-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Workers install solar on Huguenot High School in Richmond. (Sun Tribe Solar)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Tiers IV and V allow RECs from utility-scale facilities located anywhere within PJM, accounting for more than half the RPS total for the first several years. If utilities choose to buy these out-of-state RECs instead of building new renewable energy in Virginia for this tier, ratepayers will be paying for economic development and jobs in other states, rather than supporting clean energy jobs at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(As I’ll describe below, this is an even bigger drawback of the Green New Deal Act.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defenders of the PJM RECs approach cite market efficiency and cost; RECs from states that don’t have RPS laws tend to be cheap, and allowing them to qualify for our RPS means projects will get built wherever it is cheapest to do it. That justifies allowing a small percentage of PJM RECs, but not making those RECs the centerpiece.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEA already has another, and better, cost-containment measure. If prices of RECs go too high, utilities have an option of paying into a fund administered by the state Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy instead. The money will be used for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in Virginia benefiting mainly low-income residents. This “deficiency payment” alternative is a standard feature of other states’ RPS laws; it provides a critical cost cap while not letting utilities off the hook. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEA also includes community solar provisions and removal of certain barriers to net metering. It raises the net metering cap to 10%, raises the commercial size cap to 3 MW, removes all caps on third-party power purchase agreements, eliminates standby charges on residential and agricultural customers, and allows customers to install facilities large enough to meet 150% of their previous year’s demand. (These net-metering provisions intentionally duplicate five of the eight provisions of the Solar Freedom legislation, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB572" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB572</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+SB710" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SB710</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to all of this, the CEA includes a mandate for 2,400 megawatts of energy storage by 2035, with interim targets beginning with 100 MW by the end of 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And just in case Dominion thinks that somehow all this still leaves room for any new fossil fuel plants, the CEA ends with a one-year moratorium on the permitting of any new carbon-emitting generating units that an investor-owned utility might want to build, until the government produces a report with recommendations for achieving a carbon-free electric sector by 2050 at least cost to ratepayers.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Green New Deal</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+sum+HB77" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB77</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Del. Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke) is the Green New Deal Act. Its major features include a moratorium on any new fossil fuel infrastructure; a very aggressive timetable for 100% renewable energy by 2036; energy efficiency standards and a mandate for buildings to decrease energy use; low-income weatherization; job training; a requirement that companies hire workers from environmental justice communities; and assistance for workforce transition for fossil fuel workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GND looks almost nothing like the Clean Energy Act. Its moratorium on new fossil fuel infrastructure is far broader than that in the CEA, covering not just electric-generating plants but also pipelines, refineries, import and export terminals and fossil fuel exploration activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It directs DMME to develop a climate action plan that addresses mitigation, adaptation and resiliency, supports publicly-owned clean energy and incorporates environmental justice principles. Forty percent of funds spent under the plan are to be targeted to low-income communities and communities of color.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GND’s energy efficiency mandates are much tougher than the CEA’s, requiring savings of 2.4% per year beginning immediately. These savings will be achieved not just by weatherizing buildings, upgrading heating and cooling, etc., but also by dramatically improving new buildings and requiring installation of rooftop solar wherever feasible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DMME is also required to set performance benchmarks for scholarships, low-interest loans, job training programs and renewable energy projects to serve EJ communities (“until such date that 100 percent of the energy consumed in such communities is clean energy”), as well as a mandate that 50% of the workforce for energy efficiency and clean energy programs come from EJ communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(We should pause here for a reality check. We’re talking about Virginia, where many excellent programs that are already on the books currently go unfunded, and underinvestment in education and social services means companies can’t find enough qualified workers as it is.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all its aims of putting the energy transition on steroids, the Green New Deal also has a surprisingly weak RPS. In fact, it appears utilities would not have to build renewable energy projects in Virginia at all — or for that matter, close any fossil fuel plants. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_6076" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-6076" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Chesterfield2_RYANKELLY-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dominion Energy&#8217;s coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill doesn’t actually say so, but it appears to contemplate that the very fast ramp-up of renewable energy to 80% by 2030 can be achieved by utilities buying renewable energy certificates from other states. I’m told Delegate Rasoul has confirmed this is his intention. There is no requirement for utilities to buy from in-state producers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a practical reason for this: given how far behind Virginia is in developing wind and solar, allowing utilities to buy out-of-state RECs is probably the only way to meet an 80% by 2030 target. These RECs are traded on the open market; that makes it easy for utilities to comply, and eliminates reliability concerns because utilities can continue to run their existing fossil fuel plants as usual. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s the rub: the bill contains no requirement to build wind and solar in Virginia, and utilities can run their fossil fuel plants as usual. That’s not the energy transition a lot of people are looking for.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Renewable energy advocates are hoping that 2020 will be the year Virginia finally begins to make wind and solar the centerpiece of its energy planning, rather than a grudging add-on. The General Assembly will consider at least two bills that adopt a mandatory renewable portfolio standard as well as legislation to lower carbon emissions and open the private market to greater investments in renewables.</p>
<p>But good intentions don’t always produce effective legislation. Sloppy drafting causes unanticipated consequences. Minor amendments offered by an opponent produce major consequences only the opponent anticipated.</p>
<p>For a case in point, let’s consider Virginia’s existing, voluntary RPS. Worse than useless, it has enabled all kinds of mischief by defining “renewable energy” to include things that do not contribute carbon-free renewable power to the grid</p>
<p>As currently written, our renewable portfolio standard never has been, and never will be, responsible for a single electron of wind or solar energy. That means that any bill that takes as its starting point the definition that currently exists in the Virginia Code, or even uses the term “renewable energy” without narrowly defining it, risks failing right out of the gate.</p>
<p>Part of the problem<a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/12/02/whats-not-to-like-about-biomass-deforestation-pollution-and-overpriced-power/" target="_blank"> is biomass</a>. But a much greater problem is one that has been largely overlooked, mainly because no one understands it. It’s called “thermal” energy, and it is a major piece of mischief all by itself.</p>
<p>Added to the statute in 2015, thermal <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenpower/renewable-energy-certificates-recs" target="_blank">renewable energy certificates</a> quickly became the primary means for Dominion Energy Virginia to meet its RPS targets, after counting the energy from the utility’s own hydro and biomass facilities and those from which it buys power under contract.</p>
<p>The thing is, no one seems to know where thermal RECs come from. The code offers three possibilities. One is “the proportion of the thermal . . . energy from a facility that results from the co-firing of biomass.” Another is “the thermal energy output from (i) a renewable-fueled combined heat and power generation facility that is (a) constructed, or renovated and improved, after January 1, 2012, (b) located in the Commonwealth, and (c) utilized in industrial processes other than the combined heat and power generation facility.” Finally, there is a tiny (and mainly unused) category for solar hot water systems and swimming pool heating.</p>
<p>The second definition, added to the code in 2015, is so specific that it was clearly written with a particular industrial facility or facilities in mind. From that definition, we can determine that thermal RECs don’t represent renewable electricity added to the grid.</p>
<p>What no one but Dominion seems to have known was that thermal RECs would instantly become the leading category for RECs, and one that would eliminate any chance for wind or solar to ever compete for RPS dollars in Virginia.</p>
<p>The Virginia statute is an oddity. “Thermal” is not a recognized category in the regional registry for purchase and sale of RECs among utilities and voluntary buyers (known as PJM GATS). I also haven’t found another state RPS program that includes thermal in its definition of renewable energy, aside from solar thermal.</p>
<p>A year ago I asked Dominion what kind of industry supplies thermal RECs; I was promised an answer, but none came. So a week ago I asked the staff of the State Corporation Commission. They don’t know either.</p>
<p>Every year in November, Dominion submits a report to the SCC about its renewable energy activities, including information the law requires about a utility’s RPS program. The reports are available on the SCC website.</p>
<p>None of the reports include any discussion of thermal RECs, including the report submitted covering 2015, the first year these RECs were allowed. The reports don’t indicate where thermal RECs come from, what kind of industrial process produces them, or whether there might be a lot more available that could supply Dominion in the future as RPS goals increase.</p>
<p>However, by law Dominion has to provide other information that, read together, allows us to deduce a few bits of information about thermal RECs, and about their role in the RPS:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are generated by one or more Virginia facilities.</li>
<li>The facility or facilities were placed in service this decade, confirming that we are talking about that second meaning of thermal.</li>
<li>The facilities are not owned by Dominion.</li>
</ul>
<p>All or almost all the RECs Dominion purchases are thermal RECs. Thermal RECs make up all or nearly all the energy and RECs Dominion has banked to use in future years. (Virginia law allows a utility to hang on to a REC for up to five years after it was generated.) If these were wind and solar RECs instead of thermal RECs, the value of the banked RECs would exceed $40 million, even at the low REC prices currently prevailing in the PJM marketplace.</p>
<p>I compiled the information from these reports into the table below. The 2019 filing, containing information for 2018, also gives us a view into the current year. It states: “The company began 2019 with banked renewable energy and RECs of 4,252,354 MWh and expects to have a bank of approximately 4,113,477 MWh of renewable energy and RECs toward future RPS targets at year-end 2019.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_14071" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:876px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ivy_CHART.png" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class=" wp-image-14071" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ivy_CHART.png" alt="" width="876" height="290" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ivy_CHART.png 855w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ivy_CHART-300x99.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ivy_CHART-768x254.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ivy_CHART-696x230.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Source: Virginia State Corporation Commission. (Ivy Main)</p></figure>
<p>As you can see, Dominion has enough RECs banked that, when added to generation from Dominion’s own or contracted renewable energy facilities, Dominion has no need to purchase any RECs from any source until 2022 (when it still won’t need much).</p>
<p>Dominion doesn’t report what it paid for thermal RECs, but they are undoubtedly cheaper than any other qualifying source. One reason: with no competitive market for thermal RECs, Dominion is almost certainly the only buyer. In antitrust parlance, the term for this is “monopsony,” a word I hope you will now want to work into your dinner table conversation.</p>
<p>Monopsony power includes the power to set the price of a product, because the seller has no one else to sell to. In the case of thermal RECs, we don’t know who the seller is, but clearly its primary business is not the production of thermal RECs for sale. In fact, the money it gets for these RECs likely represents a windfall, and it is happy to get anything that covers its administrative cost in documenting its use of thermal energy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Dominion doesn’t have to be overly stingy, since Virginia law allows the utility to pass on to ratepayers the cost of purchasing RECs for the RPS. One can imagine Dominion CEO Thomas Farrell having a nice dinner with the CEO of the corporation owning the industrial facility that uses the thermal energy, and together deciding what Virginia consumers will pay for these RECs. As long as it is less than the cost of other RECs available to Dominion, who will complain?</p>
<p>Whatever the price is, a monopsony price of thermal RECs will be less than the price of wind and solar RECs in Virginia, because wind and solar have a competitive market and buyers who are willing to pay more.</p>
<p>For years, critics have complained that the voluntary RPS is a failure for every purpose except greenwashing. But with no appetite for reform in the General Assembly, it’s been easy to ignore how the definition of renewable energy was expanding like a slime mold escaping its petri dish.</p>
<p>This year, though, the reformers are on the move. One or more bills requiring utility investments in renewable energy seem likely to gain traction. Advocates will be keeping their fingers crossed—and reading the definitions.</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if you could get your electricity from a fuel that destroys forests, produces more air pollution than coal, and is priced higher than alternatives?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wow, sign me up!” you would not say, because as a sane person you don’t like deforestation, pollution and overpriced power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, because you are not Dominion Energy Virginia. Dominion burned wood at one power plant from 1994 until last year; converted three small coal plants to wood-burning in 2013; and burns wood along with coal at its Virginia City coal plant. This “biomass” energy makes up about one percent of the electricity Dominion sells to Virginia ratepayers, according to its most recent IRP. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biomass counts as renewable under the Virginia Code, so in theory it can also be used to supply customers who are willing to pay extra for renewable energy. Lots of people want renewable energy these days. Unfortunately for Dominion, they want clean, non-polluting renewables like wind and solar. No one is clamoring for biomass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s especially true because </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/sami-yassa/dominions-investments-biomass-electricity-lose-big-time" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">biomass costs more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than wind or solar, not to mention </span><a href="https://www.wbdg.org/resources/biomass-electricity-generation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than fossil sources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Who’s going to buy dirty energy when they can get clean energy for less money? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We recently learned just how much more expensive biomass is when the State Corporation Commission held a hearing on Dominion’s latest effort to get a renewable energy tariff approved. </span><a href="http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch#/caseDetails/139783" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rider TRG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> combines wind, solar and hydro with biomass, originally including biomass burned at the Virginia City coal plant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty much everyone hates the proposed tariff, as the Virginia Mercury</span> <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/25/facing-backlash-dominion-says-its-willing-to-have-coal-plant-removed-from-green-energy-package/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Counties looking to buy renewable energy objected. Corporate customers said they wouldn’t buy it. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_10208" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1920px;"><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Virginia-City-Hybrid-Energy-Center-II.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-10208" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Virginia-City-Hybrid-Energy-Center-II.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1268" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Virginia-City-Hybrid-Energy-Center-II.jpg 1920w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Virginia-City-Hybrid-Energy-Center-II-300x198.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Virginia-City-Hybrid-Energy-Center-II-768x507.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Virginia-City-Hybrid-Energy-Center-II-1024x676.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Virginia-City-Hybrid-Energy-Center-II-696x460.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Virginia-City-Hybrid-Energy-Center-II-1068x706.jpg 1068w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Virginia-City-Hybrid-Energy-Center-II-636x420.jpg 636w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Dominion&#8217;s Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center in Wise County, Va., 2019. (Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in a halfway step meant to mollify opponents, Dominion offered to remove the Virginia City coal plant from the list of sources, while leaving in the rest of the biomass facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the interesting part: taking Virginia City out made the program more affordable. Having biomass as part of the renewable energy mix, it turns out, doesn’t save money for participants; it costs extra. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that case, you might say (again, you being a sane person), Dominion ought to remove all the biomass from Rider TRG and save participants even more money, while making it a program people might actually want. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And indeed, the SCC staff calculated that if all the biomass were to be removed, it would reduce the cost by almost two-thirds. For average residential customers using 1,000 kilowatt-hours per month, removing biomass from Rider TRG would mean the added cost of making all their power renewable would fall from $4.21 per month to $1.78. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A no-brainer, right? Making the program both cleaner </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more affordable would make it more popular and spur construction of new renewable energy facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion refused. Having the program be successful, you see, is not the point. </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/22/dominion-creates-new-choices-to-limit-choices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I wrote this summer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the purpose of Rider TRG isn’t to offer a product people want to buy, it’s to prevent anyone else from selling renewable energy. If the commission approves Dominion’s tariff, under state law competitors will be locked out of the Virginia market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the biomass turns out to be a kind of poison pill for the program, so that no one signs up, that really doesn’t matter to Dominion because, again, the whole point of Rider TRG isn’t to attract customers, it’s to kill competition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SCC hasn’t ruled on the program yet. Post-hearing briefs are due Dec, 20, so we can expect an order in the case early next year. </span></p>
<h2><b>But why biomass?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point you may be asking yourself why Dominion chose to invest in all those biomass plants in the first place. The answer is subsidies. During its early years, Virginia’s voluntary renewable portfolio standard rewarded Dominion with </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2012/10/17/rps-wars-the-empire-nips-back/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tens of millions of dollars annually</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a bonus for meeting the renewable energy goals set out in the law. Section </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title56/chapter23/section56-576/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">56-576</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Virginia Code very helpfully defines renewable energy to include “biomass, sustainable or otherwise, (the definitions of which shall be liberally construed).”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fun fact: as recently as </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?081+ful+CHAP0272" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2008</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, only “sustainable biomass” qualified as renewable energy. The definition was altered in </span><a href="http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?091+ful+CHAP0748" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2009</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at the same time it was expanded to cover biomass burned in a coal-fired power plant such as the one Dominion had just announced it would build. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RPS bonus money boondoggle came to an end in 2013 when public outrage reached a fever pitch. Then-Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2013/02/19/renewable-energy-makes-small-gains-in-virginias-2013-legislative-session/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reached a deal on legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to repeal the bonus money provisions of the statute. (Utilities could still recover the costs of the RPS program from ratepayers.) Left intact was everything else, including defining renewable energy as “biomass, sustainable or otherwise.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberally construing “sustainable or otherwise” has not been good for southeastern forests. </span><a href="https://www.dogwoodalliance.org/our-work/our-forests-arent-fuel/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogwood Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/cases-and-projects/biomass-energy-in-the-south" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southern Environmental Law Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> document widespread clear-cutting, loss of forests, and replacement of mixed hardwood forests with pine plantations. As these groups and others have also pointed out, burning wood produces more pollution than coal and isn’t carbon-neutral in the time frame that matters for the climate pickle we’re in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion is not the worst offender; pride of place belongs to wood pellet manufacturer and exporter </span><a href="https://rachelcarsoncouncil.org/clear-cut/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enviva</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which </span><a href="http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/16627/enviva-receives-virginia-deq-approval-to-expand-southampton-plant" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">just received a permit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand its Virginia facility in Southampton. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion also isn’t the only Virginia utility to have invested in burning trees. Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative provides its customers with electricity from a biomass plant in South Boston. NOVEC doesn’t have an RPS to meet, so it sells<a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenpower/renewable-energy-certificates-recs" target="_blank"> renewable energy certificates</a> to Maryland utilities. It’s a lousy deal for the Maryland residents who get higher bills and no clean energy to show for it, but meanwhile NOVEC </span><a href="https://www.novec.com/About_NOVEC/SBE.cfm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">brags</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about its “environmentally friendly” plant. </span></p>
<h2><b>So now what?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are really two questions when it comes to burning trees for fuel: one, should government give it preferential treatment; and two, should an electric utility be doing it at all? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The General Assembly will almost certainly consider legislation this year requiring utilities to increase the proportion of electricity they sell that comes from renewable energy. If biomass is allowed to qualify, the result will be less new wind and solar and less progress towards a carbon-free grid. The lesson from other states that have renewable energy mandates is simple: states that allow junk get junk. (</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-marylands-renewable-energy-law-subsidizes-virginias-dirty-air/2018/12/28/07704890-ffc5-11e8-862a-b6a6f3ce8199_story.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s looking at you</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Maryland.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as we’ve seen, biomass can’t compete with other energy sources on cost if it doesn’t get subsidies. Dominion can follow NOVEC’s lead in selling RECs to Maryland or other states that haven’t wised up yet, but REC payments won’t make up the cost difference between biomass and other fuels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Worse—or better, depending on your point of view—other states may decide not to support the biomass racket. Maybe Dominion could still sell the renewable energy certificates (RECs) to the ultra-cheap </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/08/green-power-for-suckers-program-gets-scc-approval/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green Power for Suckers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program that the SCC approved a couple weeks back. But selling cheap RECs to chumps would net the company only—ahem—chump change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the SCC should take a hard look at biomass when Dominion files its next Integrated Resource Plan. Requiring the utility to get out of the wood-burning business wouldn’t just clean the air and protect forests, it could be a smart way to save money for customers.  </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s State Corporation Commission has </span><a href="http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4jkt01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dominion Energy Virginia’s request to offer a new product to electric utility customers who want to buy renewable energy at a discount but lack the knowledge to understand when they are being taken for chumps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rider REC” is an ultra-cheap version of the company’s Green Power Program (itself of </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2013/10/10/whats-wrong-with-dominions-green-power-program/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">questionable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> value). For less than a buck a month on their electric bills, customers will be able to buy<a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenpower/renewable-energy-certificates-recs" target="_blank"> renewable energy certificates</a> that cost Dominion next to nothing because no one else wants them. And for good reason: these are the dregs of the renewable energy category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t find any wind or solar in Rider REC, but you might find paper mill waste, trees burned after clear-cutting  or century-old hydro dams — all officially “renewable” under the generous provisions of Virginia law. Dominion will scrounge up these old and dirty leftovers, package them up and put a green bow on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Caveat emptor,” says the SCC with a shrug. The SCC seems to think anyone dumb enough to pay extra voluntarily deserves whatever they get. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the first time the SCC has shown disregard for eco-conscious consumers. Four years ago it gave Dominion the nod for a program the company was calling “community solar,” which </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2015/09/09/dominion-to-offer-community-solar-minus-the-community-and-the-solar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wasn’t actually selling any solar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and had nothing to do with communities. Dominion never did roll out that program, perhaps because there was no way to market it without courting accusations of consumer fraud. But it had the SCC’s blessing for it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(In case you are confused: this was before the company’s most recent iteration of community solar, </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2018/09/17/dominion-gets-the-nod-to-sell-solar-energy-to-us-regular-folks/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also not actually community solar, and which we are still waiting for. Dominion executives could probably do with a thesaurus.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to concerns that customers wouldn’t know what they are getting, the SCC order did impose one labeling requirement. Dominion’s marketing materials must “clearly identify the source of the RECs available for purchase under Rider REC </span><i>(i.e</i>., <span style="font-weight: 400;">the less expensive of PJM Tier II RECs or national Green-e eligible RECs).” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps Dominion will even tell buyers what those things mean, though the SCC doesn’t seem to be saying it has to. In the interests of clarity, Dominion could explain that “PJM Tier II RECs” translates to “some stuff we found behind the refrigerator and think might still be edible.” But it probably won’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because, just as with the old community solar thing, the problem is that if buyers understand what’s in it, they won’t be buyers. </span></p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="650" height="437" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/turbine-build2.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/turbine-build2.jpg 650w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/turbine-build2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/turbine-build2-625x420.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">Construction of offshore wind turbines. (Ørsted)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not every day that the names of a major utility and the nation’s largest grassroots environmental organization share space on a banner. But at the American Wind Energy Association’s annual offshore wind conference earlier this month in Boston, the logos of the Virginia Chapter of the Sierra Club and Dominion Energy bookended those of half a dozen state agencies, educational institutions and business development organizations on a banner proclaiming Virginia’s commitment to offshore wind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The banner anchored a large corner booth showcasing the strengths Virginia brings to the growing industry. Broad stakeholder support is one advantage; unlike Massachusetts, Virginia has seen little opposition to its plans for developing the 112,799-acre offshore wind energy area 27 miles out from Virginia Beach. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This broad stakeholder support is the product of more than a decade of work on the part of researchers, environmental organizations, the business community and elected leaders from both parties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the Sierra Club and Gov. Ralph Northam&#8217;s administration, offshore wind offers carbon-free, renewable energy and a way to position the Virginia as a leader in the green economy. For the Port of Virginia and Virginia Beach Economic Development, it brings new business opportunities. For Old Dominion University and Virginia Tidewater Community College, it’s a chance to train young people and participate in ground-breaking research in ocean science and engineering. And for Dominion Energy, it offers a new avenue for profit and a way to rebrand itself as a clean energy company without having to shed its core investments in fracked gas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, at last, it is poised to happen. In September, Northam signed<a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/all-releases/2019/september/headline-846745-en.html" target="_blank"> an executive order</a> targeting the full build-out of the federal offshore wind lease area off Virginia by 2026; two days later, Dominion Energy, which holds the lease, confirmed it plans to build 2,600 MW of offshore wind in three phases in 2024, 2025 and 2026. Once built, the 220 turbines are projected to produce enough electricity to power over 700,000 homes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This commitment puts Virginia among the states pursuing offshore wind most aggressively. With other states rapidly increasing their own targets and signing contracts with developers, the East Coast could now see over 25,000 MW of offshore wind by 2030, with some conference speakers predicting the total will rise to 30,000 MW by the end of the decade. At the AWEA conference a year ago, that number stood at just 10,000 MW — and attendees </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/10/22/the-northam-administration-wants-a-prominent-role-for-virginia-in-offshore-wind-can-they-pull-it-off/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">were plenty jazzed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia will also have the first wind turbines in federal waters when the 2-turbine Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) pilot project reaches completion next summer. Earlier this year CVOW became the </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/BOEM-offshore-wind-federal-project-dominion-orsted-pilot-2020-clean-energy-construction-in-virginia/565123/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">first project permitted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. </span></p>
<h2><b>Massachusetts hits a snag, and sends a shiver through the industry</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second project in line, the 800-MW Vineyard Wind off Massachusetts, suffered a setback this summer when the Department of Interior <a href="https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/21092-u-s-department-of-interior-delays-vineyard-wind-project-in-massachusetts/" target="_blank">decided to require</a> an additional layer of review. Bowing to objections from the commercial fishing industry and the National Marine Fisheries Service, the department is now requiring a supplemental Environmental Impact Statement to look at the cumulative impact of many wind farms instead of limiting review to the one project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project developers and advocates wonder whether the move reflects a Trump administration change in attitude towards offshore wind or merely shows the federal government is still figuring out how to balance competing ocean uses. President Donald Trump is famously derisive of wind power, but BOEM Director Walter Cruikshank assured the AWEA audience that the administration remains committed to a successful offshore wind industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That may be, but meanwhile the delay in the project timeline is causing heartburn for industry members and anger among advocates. Jack Clarke, director of public policy &amp; government relations at Mass Audubon, commented testily that if the National Marine Fisheries Service was really so concerned about protecting fisheries, it should have acted 40 years ago before overfishing led to the collapse of Massachusetts’ cod, haddock and flounder fisheries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clarke is a veteran of more than a decade’s worth of battles over offshore wind, beginning with the ill-fated Cape Wind project proposed in 2001. Cape Wind was ultimately abandoned in 2017 in the face of implacable resistance from NIMBYs — but not from Mass Audubon and other wildlife groups, which championed the wind farm as part of the solution to global warming. Now, Clarke says, it is time for the government to put its full weight behind the wind projects.</span></p>
<h2><b>Fewer conflicts seen for Virginia</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns about commercial fishing seem less likely to stall offshore wind plans in Virginia, where </span><a href="https://www.easternshorepost.com/2019/10/17/wind-energy-studied-before-advancing-alternative-energy-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">years of public engagement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helped ensure the Virginia Wind Energy Area is reasonably free of conflicts with the fishing industry, as well as shipping and military operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AWEA panelists also agreed that careful siting and construction practices can limit harm to wildlife. Siting wind farms 25 miles or more out to sea puts them beyond the paths of migratory birds; and according to Stuart Clough, president of environmental consulting firm </span><a href="https://remote.normandeau.com/norm-apem.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">APEM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, European data shows birds tend to avoid wind farms altogether, or keep to shipping channels that transect them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet some impacts are inevitable. Sarah Courbis, protected species &amp; regulatory specialist at consulting firm </span><a href="http://www.ene.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecology and Environment, Inc.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, recommended developers follow a practice known as “adaptive management,” which involves continuous monitoring during construction and operations, with contingency plans in case problems arise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">European studies have shown that marine mammals generally adapt well to wind farms, moving out of the area during construction and returning afterwards. That is expected to hold true for the U.S., though conservation groups remain worried about interference with migrating North Atlantic right whales, a species already perilously close to extinction. Courbis said, however, that although wind farm construction affects whale behavior, the more serious threat to the species comes from entanglement in fishing gear and ship strikes, which cause most whale fatalities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Vineyard Wind </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/francine-kershaw/how-offshore-wind-developers-can-protect-right-whales" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">committed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to curtailing construction when right whales are nearby, </span><a href="http://dwwind.com/press/deepwater-wind-conservation-law-foundation-reach-agreement-protect-right-whales-block-island-wind-farm-construction/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">as Deepwater Wind did</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when building its Block Island project in 2016. Conservation groups are pressuring other developers to take similar protective measures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the more interesting features of Virginia’s CVOW pilot project is that it will test how well a double “</span><a href="https://www.maritimejournal.com/news101/marine-civils/marine-civils/air-bubble-curtain-for-windfarm-construction" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bubble curtain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” can muffle construction noise to reduce interference with marine mammals.   </span></p>
<h2><b>Questions of timing and cost</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other important questions remain for the Virginia wind farm, including whether the administration’s timeline is achievable, who will actually do the work, and — critically — what it will cost.  </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_12614" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:900px;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-12614" src="https://www.virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CVOW.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="907" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CVOW.jpg 900w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CVOW-150x150.jpg 150w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CVOW-298x300.jpg 298w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CVOW-768x774.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CVOW-696x701.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/CVOW-417x420.jpg 417w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A map of Dominion Energy&#8217;s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind test project. (Dominion Energy)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completing the first 880 MW of wind turbines off Virginia by 2024 depends on many factors that aren’t entirely under the control of Dominion and state agencies: how fast a supply chain develops; whether Virginia attracts manufacturers; how quickly port facilities can be upgraded; the availability of an installation vessel capable of handling 12-MW turbines (currently there are none in the U.S.); and whether BOEM will be able to expeditiously review the many construction and operations plans it will receive from offshore wind developers up and down the East Coast over the next few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there is the question of who will build Virginia’s first commercial wind farm. Dominion </span><a href="https://www.dominionenergy.com/company/making-energy/renewable-generation/wind/coastal-virginia-offshore-wind" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">contracted with the Danish wind giant Ørsted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for CVOW, but it has not renewed the partnership for the commercial wind farm. However, Dominion <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/11/01/on-nations-biggest-proposed-offshore-wind-farm-dominion-plans-to-fly-solo/" target="_blank">announced last week</a> it intends to build the Virginia wind farm itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That raises questions of competence and cost. Other states have proceeded with competitively-bid contracts that ensure developers are qualified and that consumers pay a fair market price for the electricity produced. The competency issue can be solved through talent acquisition, but without competition or a price guarantee, it will be a challenge for Virginia’s State Corporation Commission to ensure electricity customers don’t overpay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked Stephanie McClellan, director of the special initiative on offshore wind at the University of Delaware, how the SCC could tackle the problem. McClellan pointed to two offshore wind contracts that had been signed without competitive bidding: the ill-fated Cape Wind, and the (also never built) Bluewater Wind project in Delaware. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2007 the Delaware Public Service Commission hired an independent consultant to analyze the factors that determine the cost of electricity from a wind farm. These include the output of the turbines (primarily a factor of turbine size and wind speed), construction cost (CAPEX), operations and maintenance costs (OPEX), and financing costs. On the basis of this analysis Bluewater Wind </span><a href="https://www.ceoe.udel.edu/research/affiliated-programs/wind-power-program/de-wind-energy-area" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">won an all-source RFP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> against coal and natural gas, though thereafter it failed to find financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within a year the Great Recession and the fracking boom would combine to delay the offshore wind industry in the U.S. by nearly a decade, while the European build-out gained steam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But meanwhile, the economic case for offshore wind has only strengthened. Costs have </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/global-offshore-wind-prices-drop-32-bloombergnef/565719/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plunged 32%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the past year globally, and conference participants see further price drops ahead as the U.S. builds its own manufacturing and supply chain instead of importing European parts. </span></p>
<h2><b>Could Virginia emerge a winner?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The conventional wisdom is that higher wind speeds make offshore wind more cost-effective in the Northeast than in Virginia. But members of the Virginia team think we may have offsetting advantages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Warren, director of Virginia’s Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy, says Virginia could see lower prices than the Northeast because of lower labor costs and the proximity of our lease area to the supply chain. He sees regional collaboration with Maryland and North Carolina as the key to a low-cost supply chain. But unlike Maryland, he told conference attendees, Virginia will not impose a local contracting requirement that might increase costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Hagerman, senior project scientist at Old Dominion University, believes new, gigantic turbines like GE’s 12 MW </span><a href="https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/wind-energy/offshore-wind/haliade-x-offshore-turbine" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Haliade-X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> promise an advantage in the Southeast because they can capture more energy at low wind speeds. The very strong winds that sometimes blow off New England would force a turbine that size to shut down for its own protection, resulting in a lower overall output.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hagerman has also suggested that as a utility, Dominion’s financing costs will be lower than those of an independent developer, giving it an extra cost advantage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hagerman has led the research on the Virginia offshore wind opportunity for over a dozen years now. In 2010 he was the lead researcher for the Virginia Coastal Energy Research Consortium, whose report that year concluded a wind farm off Virginia Beach could be built cost-effectively within five to 10 years and bring economic development and thousands of jobs to the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timeline has slipped, but, the Virginia stakeholders agree, the opportunity has only gotten better. </span></p>

(American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s bad news for Virginians looking to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels: The job just got 2% harder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the percentage increase in electricity use in Virginia over the past year, according to data from the </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Energy Information Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EIA). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase was driven by the continuation of a three-year upward trend in the commercial sector. (My guess is it’s those </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/15/growth-in-data-centers-overpowers-virginias-renewable-energy-gains/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) The somewhat better news is that residential use has stayed basically flat for 10 years.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The thing is, we would expect a 2% </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">decrease</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in electricity demand every year, if we were among the states with the </span><a href="https://aceee.org/sites/default/files/state-eers-0519.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strongest energy efficiency programs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Needless to say, Virginia is not among them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia consumers share in the benefits of federal energy-saving programs for lighting, appliances and other equipment (advances that are now under attack from the Trump administration). These national standards, pretty much painless for consumers, have kept residential electricity usage from growing even as the population grows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet Virginia makes little effort to build on these savings, and it shows. The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy ranks Virginia 29</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the nation overall in its </span><a href="https://aceee.org/research-report/u1908" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 State Energy Efficiency Scorecard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; in the narrower category of electricity savings, Virginia came in a dismal 47</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This should concern policy-makers, not least because wasting energy costs money. Recent EIA data reveals that in spite of Virginia having slightly lower electricity </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">rates</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the U.S. average, our residential </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are almost $20 per month higher, continuing a long and, especially for low-income residents, a </span><a href="https://vplc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/VPLC_EnergyReport.05032017.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">painful trend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Virginia residents use more electricity per household than any other state in the nation with the exception of just six southern states (Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Louisiana and Texas).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lobbyists for our utilities argue it’s the weather here. They say hot summers drive up the use of air conditioning, while cold winters keep electric heat pumps running. We’d like to see their data. The fact is, Virginia residents use more electricity (averaging 1165 kWh per month) and have higher bills (averaging $136.59) than residents of Maryland (1005 kWh, $133.68) and Delaware (977 kWh, $122.43), even though both of those states don’t just have </span><a href="https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/average-state-temperatures-in-winter.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">colder winters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they have slightly </span><a href="https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/US/average-state-temperatures-in-summer.php" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warmer summers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if it isn’t weather, what is it? Policy. Both Maryland and Delaware have laws requiring reductions in energy consumption and have programs to make it happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth mentioning that Maryland and Delaware are members of the <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/05/02/northam-wont-touch-budget-language-that-could-cripple-carbon-capping-plan/" target="_blank">Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative</a>, the carbon-cutting compact of northeastern states that Virginia plans to join. Critics of the plan claim it will harm Virginia consumers. That makes it especially telling that of all the RGGI states, only Connecticut has higher residential electricity bills than Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most RGGI states appear in the top ranks of the ACEEE scorecard. That’s not a coincidence; those states use money from the auctioning of carbon emission allowances to fund energy efficiency programs. Consumers benefit from the resulting trade-off: their electricity rates go up, but their bills go down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shrinking a state’s carbon footprint and reducing reliance on fossil fuels are prime objectives of energy efficiency in the RGGI states, but the lower bills give success that sweet taste that keeps them coming back for more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has tackled energy efficiency in fits and starts over the years, with limited programs that tend to expire before they gain traction. That’s supposed to change now with implementation of 2018’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=181&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb966" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grid Transformation and Security Act (GTSA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The GTSA requires Dominion Energy Virginia and Appalachian Power together to propose a billion dollars’ worth of energy efficiency programs over 10 years. The State Corporation Commission </span><a href="http://www.scc.virginia.gov/newsrel/r_eneff_19.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one round of spending from Dominion in May of this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is that the GTSA only requires utilities to propose programs; it doesn’t say the programs have to be good ones, and it doesn’t require the SCC to approve them. Even the ongoing participation of a stakeholder group doesn’t change the fact that, as ever, the utilities are in the driver’s seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since they’re spending their customers’ money, Dominion and APCo are happy with this set-up. Alas, they don’t have much incentive to produce really great programs. Quite the reverse: their business model depends on an ever-increasing demand for electricity. Successful energy efficiency programs are bad for business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, the states at the top of the ACEEE scorecard all have laws called energy efficiency resource standards (EERS) that require utilities to achieve savings, not just spend money, or that take the job away from utilities entirely and entrust it to a separate entity without a conflict of interest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than half of states now have EERS, though not all target—or achieve—energy savings of 2% per year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does a good EERS work its magic? As ACEEE explains: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<h5 style="text-align: left;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In states ramping up funding in response to aggressive EERS policies, programs typically shift focus from widget-based approaches (e.g., installing new, more-efficient water heaters) to comprehensive deep-savings approaches that seek to generate greater energy efficiency savings per program participant by conducting whole-building or system retrofits.&#8221;</span></em></h5>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some deep-savings approaches also draw on complementary efficiency efforts, such as utility support for full implementation of building energy codes. Deep-savings approaches may also promote whole-building retrofits, grid-interactive efficient buildings and comprehensive changes in systems and operations by including behavioral elements that empower customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good news for Virginia is that, having failed to do much of anything on energy efficiency for all these years, we have a lot of low-hanging fruit. The GTSA can’t help but gather up some of it; a real EERS could do much more and at lower expense. We could also follow the lead of other states in adopting state-level appliance efficiency standards, tightening our building codes and allowing localities to go beyond state codes in their jurisdictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More and more, Virginia legislators accept the urgency of the climate crisis and the need to transition to renewable energy. It’s a job that requires lowering energy consumption as well as building wind and solar, and we can’t afford to do it wrong. Two years ago, most legislators settled for the flawed approach of the GTSA. In 2020, we should expect them to do better. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, you can always count on the General Assembly to do the right thing after they have tried everything else. </span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is Virginia off to the clean energy races?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week saw a cascade of clean energy announcements in Virginia. On Tuesday, Governor Northam issued an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/EO-43-Expanding-Access-to-Clean-Energy-and-Growing-the-Clean-Energy-Jobs-of-the-Future.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aimed at achieving 30 percent renewable energy by 2030 and 100 percent carbon-free energy by 2050, and with near-term state procurement targets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Dominion Energy </span><a href="https://investors.dominionenergy.com/news/press-release-details/2019/Dominion-Energy-Announces-Largest-Offshore-Wind-Project-in-US/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would fully build out Virginia’s offshore wind energy area by 2026, in line with one of the goals in the Governor’s order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Saturday morning, the Democratic Party of Virginia </span><a href="https://bluevirginia.us/2019/09/democratic-party-of-virginia-unanimously-passes-resolutions-in-support-of-100-clean-energy-green-new-deal-15-hour-minimum-wage" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unanimously passed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resolutions endorsing the Virginia Green New Deal and a goal of net zero carbon emissions for the energy sector by 2050.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, on Saturday Arlington became the first county in Virginia to </span><a href="https://newsroom.arlingtonva.us/release/arlington-sets-ambitious-goals-in-updated-community-energy-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">commit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2035, and economy-wide carbon neutrality by 2050. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So is Virginia off to the clean energy races? Well, maybe we should take a closer look.</span></p>
<h3><b>The governor’s order sounds great, but how real are its targets?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 43, “Expanding access to clean energy and growing the clean energy jobs of the future,” directs the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy (DMME) and other state agencies to “develop a plan of action to produce 30 percent of Virginia’s electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030 and one hundred percent of Virginia’s electricity from carbon-free sources by 2050.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference between “renewable energy” and “carbon-free” sources is intentional. The latter term is a nod to nuclear energy, which provides about a quarter of Virginia’s electricity today. Keeping Dominion’s four nuclear reactors in service past 2050 may not prove feasible, economical or wise, but the utility wants to keep that option open. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order also doesn’t define “renewable energy.” It talks about wind and solar, but it doesn’t specifically exclude carbon-intensive and highly-polluting sources like biomass and trash incinerators, which state code treats as renewable. Dominion currently meets Virginia’s voluntary renewable energy goals with a mix of old hydro and dirty renewables, much of it from out of state. Dominion will want to keep these subsidies flowing, especially for its expensive biomass plants, which would undermine the carbon-fighting intent of the order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, there is the question whether all of the renewable energy has to be produced in Virginia. Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, which supplies electricity to most of the member-owned cooperatives in the state, buys wind energy from outside Virginia. Surely that should count. But what if a Virginia utility just buys renewable energy certificates indicating that someone, somewhere, produced renewable energy, even if it was consumed in, say, Ohio? Those had better not count, or we’ll end up subsidizing states that haven’t committed to climate action. </span></p>
<h3><b>What will DMME’s plan look like?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In describing what should be in the action plan, Northam’s order largely recites existing goals and works in progress, but it also directs DMME and the other agencies to consider going beyond existing law and policy to achieve specific outcomes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure that utilities meet their </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">existing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> commitments to </span><b>solar and onshore wind energy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> development, including recommending legislation to reduce barriers to achieving these goals. These goals include 500 MW of utility-owned or controlled distributed wind and solar. Customer-owned solar is not mentioned.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make recommendations to ensure the Virginia </span><b>offshore wind</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> energy area is fully developed with as much as 2,500 MW of offshore wind by 2026. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make recommendations for increased utility investments in </span><b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, beyond those provided for by the passage of SB 966 in 2018, the Grid Modernization Act.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include integration of </span><b>storage technologies</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the grid and pairing them with renewable generation, including distributed energy resources like rooftop solar. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Provide for </span><b>environmental justice and equity</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the planning, including “measures that provide communities of color and low- and moderate-income communities access to clean energy and a reduction in their energy burdens.” </span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Can the administration do all that?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing in this part of the order has any immediate legal effect; it just kicks off a planning process with a deadline of July 1, 2020. Achieving some of the goals will require new legislation, which would have to wait for the 2021 legislative session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t mean the governor will sit on his hands until then &#8211; delay is the enemy of progress — but it could have the effect of slowing momentum for major climate legislation in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cynics, if you know any, might even suggest that undercutting more aggressive Green New Deal-type legislation is one reason for the order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second part of Northam’s order, however, will have immediate effect, limited but impressive. It establishes a new target for </span><strong>state procurement</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of solar and wind energy of 30 percent of electricity by 2022, up from an 8 percent goal set by former Governor Terry McAuliffe. This provision will require the Commonwealth to negotiate amendments to the contract by which it buys electricity for state-owned facilities and universities from Dominion. The order also calls for at least 10 MW annually of power purchase agreements (PPAs) for on-site solar at state facilities, and requires agencies to consider distributed solar as part of all new construction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State facilities will also be subject to new </span><b>energy savings requirements</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reduce state consumption of electricity by 10 percent by 2022, measured against a 2006 baseline, using energy performance contracting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These provisions do for the state government what the action plan is intended to do for Virginia as a whole, but 8 years faster and without potential loopholes. </span></p>
<h3><b>Thirty percent by 2030? Gee, where have we heard that before?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just this spring, Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality finalized regulations aimed at lowering carbon emissions from Virginia power plants by 30 percent by 2030. These numbers look so similar to Northam’s goal of 30 percent renewable energy by 2030 that it’s reasonable to ask what the order achieves that the carbon rule doesn’t. (This assumes the carbon regulations take effect; Republicans used a budgetary maneuver to stall implementation by at least a year.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer goes back to the reason Dominion opposed the carbon rule. Dominion maintains—wrongly, says DEQ and others—that requiring lower in-state carbon emissions will force it to reduce the output of its coal and gas plants in Virginia and buy more power from out of state. That, says Dominion, would be bad for ratepayers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the company’s August update of its Integrated Resource Plan showed, Dominion </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/09/13/ignoring-state-climate-rules-dominion-decides-what-carbon-regulations-should-look-like/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">would much prefer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a rule requiring it to build more stuff of its own. As it turns out, that would be even more expensive for ratepayers, but definitely better for Dominion’s profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So legislation to achieve Governor Northam’s renewable energy goals would take the pain out of the carbon regulations for Dominion. Whether it might also lower carbon emissions beyond DEQ’s 30 percent target remains to be seen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2050 carbon-free goal, on the other hand, goes beyond anything on the books yet. Dominion’s corporate goal is 80 percent carbon-free by 2050, and it </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/14/dominions-carbon-cutting-arent-good-enough/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has no roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to achieve even that. </span></p>
<h3><b>Is there anything in the order about pipelines?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. In fact, there is no mention of any fossil fuel infrastructure, though shuttering coal and gas plants is the main way you cut carbon from the electricity supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That doesn’t mean Northam’s order leaves the Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast pipelines in the clear. If Dominion joins Duke Energy in its pledge to go to zero carbon by 2050, the use of fracked gas to generate electricity in Virginia and the Carolinas has to go down, not up, over the coming decades (Duke’s own </span><a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/lng-natural-gas-critical-for-duke-energy-utility-aims-renewables-100-carbon-free-power/563128/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weird logic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> notwithstanding). As word gets around that Virginia is ditching fossil fuels, pipeline investors must be thinking about pulling out and cutting their losses.</span></p>
<h3><b>What about Dominion’s offshore wind announcement?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I saved the best for last. For offshore wind advocates like me, Dominion’s announcement was the really big news of the week: it’s the Fourth of July, </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2018/12/24/all-i-want-for-christmas-is-a-500-mw-offshore-wind-farm/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christmas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and New Years all at once. Offshore wind is Virginia’s largest long-term renewable energy resource opportunity, and we can’t fully decarbonize without it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has taken a go-slow approach to offshore wind ever since </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2013/09/06/dominion-wins-virginia-offshore-wind-lease-well-duh/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">winning the right</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to develop the federal lease area in 2013. Until this year, it refused to commit to anything more than a pilot project. The two, 6-MW turbines are currently under construction and will be installed next summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in March, Dominion CEO Tom Farrell told investors his company planned to build one commercial offshore wind farm, of unspecified size, to be operational in 2024. In its Aug. 28 resource plan update filed with the state regulators, Dominion Energy Virginia included for the first time an 880-MW wind farm, pushed back to 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A mere three weeks later, the plan has changed to three wind farms, a total of 220 turbines with a capacity of 2,600 MW, with the start date moved up again to 2024, and all of them in service by 2026, exactly Northam’s target (except his was 2,500 MW). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly the case for developing the full lease area has been improving at a rapid clip. Costs are falling dramatically, and it appears Dominion expects to maximize production by using massive 12 MW turbines, which did not even exist until this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if the situation has changed that dramatically from August to September, all I can say is, I can’t wait to see what October brings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe it will bring answers to questions like who will build these wind farms, who will pay for them, and how Dominion expects to meet this accelerated timeline. As Sarah Vogelsong </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/09/24/four-things-to-know-about-dominions-massive-wind-farm-proposal/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reports</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, several northeastern states have wind farms slated for development in the early-to-mid-2020s, too. Industry members are already worried about bottlenecks in everything from the supply chain to installation vessels, workforce training and the regulatory approval process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is to say, we’re coming to the party pretty late to expect good seats. But hey, it’s going to be a great party, and I’m glad we won’t miss it.</span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p>For several years now, Dominion Energy Virginia has factored into its plans an assumption that electricity from carbon-emitting power plants will eventually include a cost reflecting CO2’s role as the primary driver of global warming. Dominion says it has even integrated this into its corporate goals, targeting an 80 percent reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>That promise <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/14/dominions-carbon-cutting-arent-good-enough/" target="_blank">may be more propaganda</a> than corporate lodestar, but in any case the utility’s Integrated Resource Plans regularly point to the probability of future carbon regulations as a reason to build new renewable energy facilities and close old coal plants.</p>
<p>Planning for constraints on CO2 emissions proved wise this spring when Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality finalized a state carbon cap-and-trade program. The DEQ regulations call for Virginia power plant owners to trade carbon allowances with those in the member states of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). A Republican budget maneuver has delayed implementation of the new rules, but once they take effect they are expected to hasten the retirement of expensive old coal plants and support investments in new renewable energy projects.</p>
<p>But it’s not the DEQ regulations that Dominion is planning around. The utility’s 2019 update to its 2018 IRP, filed with the State Corporation Commission on Aug. 29, treats the DEQ regulations as hypothetical. Instead, it posits some unspecified future federal carbon regulations that, apparently, it would like much better.</p>
<p>The update describes three alternative scenarios, down from five in the 2018 IRP. The first is a “base case” that assumes no carbon emission constraints. The second assumes the state carbon limits take effect as well as some future federal regulations, and the third assumes federal (but not state) limits. However, the cover letter makes it clear that only the third scenario actually describes what Dominion intends to do. As it happens, that is the most expensive— and most profitable —plan.</p>
<p>The primary feature of the base case is that it keeps some old coal units running that will be closed in the other scenarios. According to Dominion, this makes it the least-cost approach to meeting electricity demand. Whether that’s true is a matter of dispute; these units hardly run at all any more, and experts for environmental organizations in the IRP hearing testified that retiring them will save money for customers.</p>
<p>It suits Dominion’s political strategy, however, to pretend that coal remains a low-cost option. This fiction makes coalfield legislators happy, and it allows Dominion to blame rising electricity rates on environmental regulations instead of on its own profligate spending and <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/blog-va/dominion-earned-278-million-more-than-permitted-in-2018-regulators-find/" target="_blank">excess profits</a>.</p>
<p>But Dominion Energy made a big bet on fracked gas, not coal. It won’t fight to keep outdated coal plants online and spewing out CO2 if it’s cheaper to close them. Gas plants are another matter. Dominion Energy’s massive investments in gas transmission and storage make the company keen to keep Virginia gas plants running full-tilt, and to build as much new gas generation as possible.</p>
<p>For that reason, Dominion hates the DEQ regulations. It warns the regional cap and trade plan will result in power from outside the state replacing electricity from Dominion’s combined-cycle gas plants, which provide baseload power. Dominion argues this will lead to higher, rather than lower, carbon emissions as well as higher consumer costs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/02/06/as-virginia-prepares-to-join-carbon-trading-states-arguments-erupt-over-the-price-of-admission/" target="_blank">DEQ and others disagree</a> on both counts, though the SCC <a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/04/09/whos-right-in-fight-over-carbon-compliance-costs/" target="_blank">takes Dominion’s view.</a> So although Dominion labels its second scenario RGGI-compliant, it treats the DEQ regulations as hypothetical, as if Gov. Ralph Northam might change his mind any day now and order them scrapped.</p>
<p>Instead, Dominion offers its third scenario, positing only unspecified and (with Trump as president) truly hypothetical future federal carbon regulations. In Dominion’s fantasy, a federal plan will be strong enough to support Dominion building profitable new renewable energy and storage projects, but not so strong that it can’t also build a bunch of new gas plants.</p>
<p>Ergo, that’s what Dominion is shooting for. The cover letter accompanying the IRP update makes it clear that Dominion is already pursuing projects that appear only in the third plan. These include a 300 MW pumped hydro storage project that will take a decade to develop and cost upwards of $1.5 billion (if indeed it pans out), and an 852 MW offshore wind project slated for 2025, a year later than what Dominion told investors in March.</p>
<p>The third scenario also includes more than 3,000 MW of solar between now and the end of 2034, but that’s actually a whole lot less solar than under the RGGI scenario. Even the base case has more solar. Go figure.</p>
<p>Still missing is the rest of the 2,000 MW of offshore wind that the Virginia lease area can support. Also still missing are thousands more megawatts of wind and solar that Virginia would need if, instead of a gas-friendly plan, the federal government were to enact regulations actually sufficient to the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Dominion has not even modeled that possibility. The update’s third scenario still includes 10 new fracked-gas combustion turbines, a total of 2,425 MW, with two units coming online every year from 2022 through 2026.</p>
<p>Maybe the Dominion executive team thinks it knows more than the rest of us do about the federal climate plan we’ll see once Donald Trump is sent packing in 2020. More likely, Dominion is simply using its IRP carbon assumptions to bolster its case for more spending and higher profits.</p>
<p>In which case, the more things get updated, the more they stay the same.</p>

What, then, are we to make of white nationalists who invoke environmental concerns to justify acts of violence against immigrants?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent news articles tell us the suspect in the El Paso massacre cited overpopulation as a reason for killing 21 shoppers at a Walmart in the Texas border city. Latinos make up more than 82% of El Paso’s population, many of them Mexican-born. The suspect, Patrick Crusius, is </span><a href="https://www.eenews.net/stories/1060857195" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said to have written</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a “manifesto” decrying Americans’ over-exploitation and degradation of natural resources. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The American lifestyle . . . is destroying the environment of our country,” he wrote, before concluding, bizarrely, that therefore he should kill non-Americans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crusius </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59nmv5/eco-fascism-the-racist-theory-that-inspired-the-el-paso-and-christchurch-shooters-and-is-gaining-followers" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is said to have drawn inspiration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from an earlier mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a white nationalist killed 51p eople at two mosques in the name of “eco-fascism.” He defined the term as “ethnic autonomy for all peoples with a focus on preservation of nature and the natural order.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a member of the Sierra Club for almost 40 years, I find this sounds familiar. Starting in the late 1980s, anti-immigrant forces </span><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2004/former-sierra-club-director-discusses-hostile-takeover-attempt-anti-immigrant-activists" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tried to take over the </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">environmental group</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in an effort that wasn’t fully exposed and defeated until 2004. I remember the critical board election; the anti-immigration candidates made a plausible case for overpopulation as a root cause of much of what ails the environment, then and now. If you have fewer people around, after all, there’s only so much harm they can do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only, of course, the problem wasn’t—and isn’t—immigrants, it was U.S. laws that allowed native-born Americans to pollute our land, air and water. Keeping out immigrants isn’t a solution, it’s a non-sequitur. Realizing this, Sierra Club members firmly rejected the anti-immigrant slate of board candidates</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White nationalists aren’t just wrong in blaming immigrants for environmental ills. They also refuse to acknowledge that today’s most serious environmental challenges are global. Climate change, ocean acidification, the rapid loss of species—to name just a few—can’t be stopped by building walls and evicting non-white people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This may be one reason many right-wing voters still reject the scientific consensus that climate change is a human-caused problem. The qualities most treasured by much of the radical right—self-sufficiency, male supremacy, physical strength, proficiency with weapons—aren’t useful in solving climate change. It’s human nature to disregard a problem you don’t think you have the tools to tackle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Managing global problems requires international cooperation, respect for others, patience in the face of provocation, and empathy for those who are suffering. People of faith, humanists, and adults in general recognize these as higher-order virtues, but they are the first to be dispensed with in a zero-sum situation. People who believe the survival of their way of life requires other people to suffer do not ask themselves, “What would Jesus do?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is indeed a case for despair about the health of the planet. Bad news dogs us daily, from the deforestation of the tropics and the collapse of insect and amphibian populations, to the intensification of hurricanes and the plague of plastic waste. And then, of course, there’s the possibility that we have now passed a critical greenhouse gas tipping point and entered an age of runaway global warming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it isn’t fear of nature’s wrath that keeps me and other climate activists up at night. It’s the steady erosion of our conviction that we humans have it in us to rise to the enormous challenges before us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the world, people are responding to resource scarcity and an increase in refugees not with compassion and generosity but with anger and distrust. Nationalism is confused with patriotism. Identity politics replaces communitarian values. Democracy is in retreat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is particularly maddening because, in fact, we know how to address the environmental challenges we face. We have the technology to quit fossil fuels. We can adapt to sea-level rise. We can make room for climate refugees. We can stop deforestation, and even reclaim deserts for trees. We don’t need to poison the earth to grow crops. We could end plastic waste tomorrow. We can’t bring back the species we’ve lost (at least not many of them), but we can do a much better job of protecting the ones we have left. Even reversing the rise in atmospheric carbon is conceivable, if we undertake to do it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The question isn’t whether humans can do these things, it’s whether we will. Americans should be the ones leading the way, negotiating treaties with other nations, funding research, implementing solutions that benefit everyone, and keeping our doors open to the dispossessed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the sort of thing Americans used to do—not always, admittedly, but in hindsight we recognize those as our finest moments. We desperately need this sense of purpose again now, when the threats we face are existential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to do that, we have to reject a foreign policy grounded in selfishness and domestic policies that feed racism, xenophobia, and climate-science denialism here at home. There are no “other” people we can exclude, neglect or destroy to save ourselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is only all of us, all across the world, and we are all in this together. </span></p>

</p><p>In June, Fairfax County announced it was seeking proposals from solar companies to install solar at up to 130 county-owned facilities and schools, with another 100 sites to be considered for a later round. The request for proposals (RFP) covers solar on building roofs, ground-mounted solar and solar canopies over parking lots.</p>
<p>This massive solar buy could add as much as 30-40 megawatts of solar, according to one industry member’s calculation. This would easily triple the amount of solar installed to date <a href="https://www.novaregion.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=684" target="_blank">in the entire NoVa region</a>. What’s more, Fairfax County’s contract will be “rideable” so that other Virginia localities can install solar using the same prices and terms.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to overstate how significant a move this is,” says Debra Jacobson, an energy lawyer who serves on the county’s Environmental Quality Advisory Council. “It’s not just the largest solar buy by a local government in Virginia. It also opens the door for other Virginia counties and cities to buy solar because it makes the process simple and straightforward.”</p>
<p>Jacobson says approximately 15 solar companies attended a bidder’s conference hosted by Fairfax County, indicating strong interest. The county intends to select a contractor by early fall.</p>
<p>One problem stands in the way: Virginia law currently places an overall limit of 50 MW on projects installed in Dominion territory using third-party power purchase agreements (PPAs), the primary financing mechanism for tax-exempt entities.</p>
<p>Even without Fairfax County’s projects, the solar industry warns the cap will likely be met by the end of this year, as schools, universities, churches and other customers across Virginia sign PPAs at an accelerating rate.</p>
<p>The solar industry is asking the State Corporation Commission for action to keep the market alive. <a href="https://securefutures.solar" target="_blank">Secure Futures LLC</a>, a Staunton-based solar developer, submitted a letter to the SCC on June 24 asking the commission to raise the program cap from 50 MW to 500 MW in Dominion territory and 7 to 30 MW in Appalachian Power territory and to increase the size limit for individual projects from 1 MW to 3 MW.</p>
<p>PPAs allow customers to have on-site solar installed with no upfront cost; the customer pays only for the electricity the solar array produces, at a price that is typically below the price of electricity purchased from the utility. It’s an especially critical tool for cash-strapped local governments and school systems, letting them save taxpayer money while lowering their carbon footprint. Every kilowatt-hour they get from solar replaces electricity they would have to buy from the grid, which in Virginia still comes almost entirely from fossil fuels and nuclear.</p>
<p>For-profit monopoly utilities like Dominion Energy Virginia and Appalachian Power don’t like losing sales when customers generate their own electricity. Virginia’s customer-owned electric cooperatives negotiated legislation this year to remove PPA barriers for non-profits in their territories, but Dominion and APCo didn’t sign on. Both utilities fought <a href="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2019/01/21/virginias-solar-freedom-bill/" target="_blank">Solar Freedom</a> legislation and other bills that would have lifted the PPA cap, claiming there was still plenty of room for projects under the 50 MW cap.</p>
<p>But there may be a simple solution — if the utilities don’t fight it. The legislation that created the PPA program in 2013 directs the SCC to review it every two years beginning in 2015, and to “determine whether the limitations [on the program size and project sizes] should be expanded, reduced, or continued.”</p>
<p>The SCC has never opened a case docket or consulted stakeholders in any previous review of the program — but no one seems to have asked until now. Secure Futures’ letter requests that the SCC open a public docket for this year’s review and consult with stakeholders, including the solar industry and customers.</p>
<p>In his letter, Secure Futures’ CEO Tony Smith notes that Virginia remains well behind North Carolina and Maryland on solar installations, solely for reasons of state policy. Installations using PPAs also lagged until the past year, but are now expanding “at an exponential rate,” according to Secure Futures, with notifications filed for almost 20 MW of projects as of June 12. This number does not include the Fairfax County projects or many others that are still in the early stages of development.</p>
<p>Other solar developers have also asked the SCC to lift the PPA cap. Ruth Amundsen, manager of the <a href="https://www.norfolksolar.org" target="_blank">Norfolk Solar Qualified Opportunity Zone Fund</a>, told the SCC in a July 20 letter that her fund has identified $117 million of potential solar sites in the Norfolk and Virginia Beach area. The fund brings in investors and installs solar on businesses and non-profits in Virginia Qualified Opportunity Zones, which are low income census tracts <a href="https://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/opportunity-zones-oz" target="_blank">that offer tax benefits for investors</a>, at no upfront cost to the customer.  It also hires residents of the Opportunity Zones as solar installers, training them and providing employment.</p>
<p>But, Amundsen’s letter notes, “Without PPAs, none of this is possible. If the PPA cap remains at 50MW, we cannot in good conscience advise these investors to invest in solar in the Virginia QOZs, as there would be no feasible financing method once the cap is reached.”</p>
<p>Amundsen also wants the ability to use PPAs for installation on private homes, which is currently not allowed under the terms of the PPA program in Dominion territory. “The original intent of the Norfolk Solar QOZ Fund was to mitigate the energy burden of low-income home owners.  But because of the current limitation on Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in Virginia, we cannot install on private homes via a PPA.  Removal of that limitation, and clarification that PPAs are legal with all customers, would allow us to better serve the most affected residents as far as crushing utility bills.&#8221;</p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Climate-Change-American-Mind-December-2018.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by Yale and George Mason universities shows concern about climate change is surging. Seventy-three percent of Americans think climate change is happening, and 69% are at least somewhat worried about it, the highest percentages since the surveys began in 2011. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another Yale survey </span><a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/energy-in-the-american-mind-december-2018/2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that “a large majority of registered voters (85%) – including 95% of Democrats and 71% of Republicans – support requiring utilities in their state to produce 100% of their electricity from clean, renewable sources by 2050. Nearly two in three conservative Republicans (64%) support this policy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet here in Virginia, Dominion Energy expects to reduce carbon emissions </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/07/14/dominions-carbon-cutting-arent-good-enough/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">less in the future than in the past</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it has no plan to produce 100% of its electricity from clean, renewable sources by 2050. For all the talk here of solar, Virginia still had </span><a href="https://www.seia.org/states-map" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one-seventh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the amount of solar installed as North Carolina at the end of 2018 and no wind energy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has developed a few solar projects and new tariffs to serve tech companies and other large customers, but ordinary residents still lack meaningful choices. So this spring, Dominion decided to do something about that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wrong thing, of course. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion has asked the State Corporation Commission for permission to market two quasi-environmentally-responsible products. One is for people who are willing to pay a premium for renewable energy, and don’t read labels, and the other is for people who want a bargain on renewable energy, and don’t read labels. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There may be plenty of both kinds of customers out there, but that doesn’t mean the SCC should approve either product. Indeed, while the purpose of the bargain product is to offer a choice nobody wants, the purpose of the premium product is to close off better choices.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look first at the product for bargain-hunters, a super-cheap version of the utility’s Green Power Program. Dominion is calling it “Rider REC.” A better name for it would be the “You Call This Green? Power Program.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rider REC consists of the dregs of the renewable energy category, the stuff that isn’t good enough for the Green Power Program. That’s a low bar already, because the Green Power Program doesn’t sell green power. It sells renewable energy certificates (RECs), the “renewable attributes” of electrons from facilities labeled renewable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers who pay extra for RECs still use whatever mix of energy their utility provides. For Dominion customers, that’s fracked gas, nuclear and coal, plus a tiny percentage of oil, biomass, hydro and solar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying RECs lets good-hearted people feel better about using dirty power by donating money to owners of renewable energy facilities somewhere else. The facilities might be in Virginia, or they might be clear across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, say a utility out west builds a wind farm because wind is the cheapest way to generate power. If the state doesn’t have a renewable portfolio standard that requires the utility to use the RECs for compliance (most windy states don’t), the RECs can be sold to buyers in liberal East Coast states, lowering energy prices for the utility’s own customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">RECs don’t even have to represent clean sources like wind. Some RECs subsidize industries that burn trees (aka biomass), </span>black liquor (a particularly dirty waste product of paper mills) and trash.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s Green Power Program uses RECs that meet the standards of a national certification program called </span><a href="https://www.green-e.org" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Green-e</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Green-e requires that facilities be no more than 15 years old and meet minimum environmental standards, such as requirements that woody biomass be sustainably grown and that generators don’t violate state and federal pollution limits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Virginia’s definition of renewable energy is, shall we say, more forgiving than Green-e’s. Our law does not discriminate against decades-old facilities like hydroelectric dams, or energy from trees that have been clear-cut. (Nor does it recognize that burning trees produces even more lung-damaging, asthma-inducing pollution than coal, and more climate-warming CO2 as well.) Virginia’s definition of renewable energy even includes a vague category of “thermal” energy that may be another way paper mills profit from the REC racket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This loose definition of “renewable” creates a business opportunity for anyone unscrupulous enough to seize it. Dominion proposes to package up these otherwise unmarketable RECs from sketchy sources across the continental United States and pawn them off on unsuspecting consumers here in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is always money to be made by suckering well-meaning folks, but that’s not a good enough reason for the SCC to let Dominion do it. The case is </span><a href="http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4gvk01!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PUR-2019-00081</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Public comments are due by Aug. 15. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what about the more expensive quasi-environmentally responsible product? “Rider TRG” consists of real, straight-from-the-facility electricity on the power grid serving Virginia, not RECs from out west. And while it is not dirt-cheap like Rider REC, Rider TRG would cost residential customers a premium of only about $50 per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, Virginia’s kitchen-sink definition of renewable energy means the sources still don’t have to be new or carbon-free or sustainable. It appears most of them won’t be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion’s filing indicates the program will use the energy from the Gaston hydroelectric dam built in 1963; the Roanoke Rapids hydro station built in 1955; the Altavista, Southampton and Hopewell power stations that were converted from coal to wood-burning in 2013; and several solar farms the company has already built or contracted for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, Dominion proposes to allocate to the program the portion of electricity from its Virginia City coal plant representing the percentage of wood that is burned along with the coal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, Dominion intends for renewable energy buyers to subsidize its coal plant. The idea is cynical enough to have come from the Trump administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion knows full well that customers who want renewable energy want new wind and solar, so why is its first product for residential customers so loaded with dirty biomass and old hydro? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is that Dominion doesn’t care if no one signs up for Rider TRG. The point isn’t to give customers what they want, it’s to prevent them from shopping elsewhere for better options.  </span><a href="https://www.virginiamercury.com/2019/01/10/appalachian-power-gets-approval-to-sell-100-percent-renewable-energy-to-customers-hold-the-champagne/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Appalachian Power before it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Dominion wants to close off the narrow opening provided by Virginia law that allows customers to shop for 100% renewable energy from other providers only if their own utility doesn’t offer it. The SCC approved APCo’s renewable energy tariff some months ago. Dominion is following APCo’s successful strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet APCo’s product consists of hydro, wind and solar, so it is nefarious, but not actually bad. Dominion’s is nefarious </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bad. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An SCC decision in 2017 </span><a href="https://powerforthepeopleva.com/2017/04/06/direct-energy-wins-right-to-sell-renewable-energy-in-virginia-but-theres-a-catch/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">confirmed customers’ right to shop</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for renewable energy as long as the incumbent utility doesn’t offer it. Currently at least two other providers, Direct Energy and Calpine Energy Solutions, offer renewable energy to commercial customers in Dominion territory. Yet according to documents provided by Direct Energy, Dominion is refusing to let its customers transfer to Direct Energy and Calpine, triggering competing petitions to the SCC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion no doubt hopes to resolve the dispute permanently by terminating its customers’ right to switch providers at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The case is </span><a href="http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/4h9501!.PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PUR-2019-00094</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Comments may be submitted until Nov. 14, and a public hearing will be held on Nov. 21.</span></p>
