(Pixabay/Creative Commons license)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers are preparing to reintroduce bipartisan legislation aimed at creating a regulated and taxed adult-use cannabis marketplace in the state. The renewed push comes after Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a similar proposal earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, are once again spearheading the effort, planning to bring forward the same proposal that previously passed both chambers of the General Assembly with bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB448" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as sent to Youngkin’s desk at the time, would establish a legal framework to regulate the sale and taxation of cannabis for adults 21 and older, marking a significant step toward implementing the retail market many advocates have long championed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to start with the same bill since we were able to get both chambers aboard, including a couple Republicans. I think there’s a good chance that a few more Republicans will join in this time, especially in the Senate,” Krizek said in a phone interview earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While several GOP lawmakers supported the proposal at various points as it moved through the legislature during the 2024 session, only Sen. Christie New Craig, R-Chesapeake, voted for the bill’s final version in the state Senate. In the House, freshman Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery County, a former assistant attorney general, was the sole Republican to back the measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was the first southern state to legalize public possession of up to one ounce of marijuana by adults 21 and over and allow them to grow up to four plants of marijuana in a private residence. However, the General Assembly has yet to create a framework for a legal marketplace for cannabis products in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a legal market in place, residents can grow small amounts at home or possess cannabis, but buying or selling it remains illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed plan, the state would license cannabis retailers, establish clear rules for production and sales, and tax products to generate new revenue. Lawmakers argue that a regulated market would also curtail illegal cannabis sales and provide consumer protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the General Assembly approved a version of the bill that would have established a market, only for Youngkin to veto the legislation, citing concerns over enforcement and the state’s role in managing cannabis commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proposed legalization of retail marijuana in the commonwealth endangers Virginians’ health and safety,” </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/101RteYQu09LrjbzzSqiFu9EIxyw7jMcCEnRvwRap-NA/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“States following this path have seen adverse effects on children’s and adolescent’s health and safety, increased gang activity and violent crime, significant deterioration in mental health, decreased road safety, and significant costs associated with retail marijuana that far exceed tax revenue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has since repeatedly expressed skepticism about expanding legal cannabis in Virginia, and his spokesman Christian Martinez said on Wednesday that this hasn’t changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Krizek remains hopeful that in his final year as governor, Youngkin may be open to negotiating with Democrats as he looks to solidify his legacy.</span></p>

Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax (courtesy of Krizek campaign)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t get into his head, obviously, but I think it’s for that reason it’s worth trying, it’s worth putting this out as an opportunity for a compromise in some other capacity,” Krizek said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”I think it&#8217;s very possible, because he’s already a lame duck and this is it for him, and if he wants to have one of his legacies be an unregulated cannabis free-for-all, then that will be his legacy. Or he could choose a rational marketplace with safe, tested and taxed products.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/documents/rcpoll/RC%20Poll%20Topline%20Feb2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College and released during the legislative debate found that 63% of Virginians strongly or somewhat support measures to help small businesses compete with pharmaceutical companies and existing medical cannabis dispensaries, while only 15% are somewhat or strongly opposed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And advocates believe there is growing momentum to push the legislation forward again. Supporters highlight the potential for tax revenue, job creation, and investments in addiction treatment and restorative justice programs funded by cannabis taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Habeeb, a former Republican member of the House of Delegates from Salem and a lobbyist for the Virginia Cannabis Association who helped draft Rouse’s bill earlier this year, said in an interview Thursday that Youngkin’s veto of the legislation caused an explosion of illegal corner marijuana stores, pop up shops and street dealers across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody who was trying to engage in this market in a proper way, some of the people selling hemp products, some of the people selling CPD products, they’ve almost all been wiped out of business,” Habeeb said. “That’s exactly what we said would happen if the government vetoed the bill to the extent there was a legally operating market in which this is essentially destroyed, and yet every day there are stories about raids and busts and illegal stores.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually Virginia is “going to have to wake up and create a regulated system, so we can get rid of these illegal stores and get this stuff out of the hands of our dealers and kids,” Habeeb said, adding that Republicans will continue to say its  Democrats fault for legalizing cannabis in the first place, and both Democrats and Republicans will continue to blame each other for the status quo, if it remains unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How that plays out for their individual legacies will have to be seen, but collectively creating a system where it’s legal to possess, legal to share, legal to grow, but illegal to sell in a regulated way, has created this system. It is completely unacceptable and I think history will tell us that it was a disaster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discussion around creating a legal marketplace for adult-use cannabis in Virginia is reignited as the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority (CCA) — the state agency created in 2021 to oversee the regulation and enforcement of cannabis laws in Virginia — unveiled its </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/664229cd06b6f9326d1e815c/t/675708223e9a06386996e75e/1733756963828/2024-Virginia-Statewide-Impaired-Driving-Survey-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on marijuana-impaired driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between August and September, the CCA surveyed 783 Virginia residents aged 16 or older with a driver’s license, including 310 who identified as past three-month marijuana users. The results, which build on the inaugural 2022 study, were released as part of National Impaired Driving Prevention Month this December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey revealed nearly one-third of Virginia drivers believe those who consume marijuana are typically safe drivers. Furthermore, 22% of respondents admitted to driving while high a few times a year or more, and 34% acknowledged riding as passengers with drivers under the influence of marijuana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-six percent of marijuana users reported they do not always plan for a sober ride home. These figures remain unchanged or have increased since the 2022 survey, underscoring the need for continued education and awareness campaigns, the CCA said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these concerns, the survey also pointed to progress. The percentage of drivers who believe they are likely to be pulled over for driving under the influence of marijuana increased to 29%, up from 24% in 2022. Additionally, 47% of marijuana users said they always plan for a sober ride home, up from 42% last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This survey shows that while we’ve made some progress, there’s still considerable work to do,” said Jeremy Preiss, acting Head and Chief Officer of Regulatory, Policy, and External Affairs at the CCA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving under the influence of marijuana is illegal in Virginia. State law prohibits using cannabis while driving or as a passenger in a vehicle. Violations can result in fines, license suspension, or even jail time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the survey still found that 1 in 10 Virginia drivers (9%) incorrectly assume that there is no penalty for driving under the influence of marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite enforcement concerns and Youngkin’s previous resistance, Krizek and Rouse — who is seeking his party’s nomination for lieutenant governor in 2025 — remain optimistic that a renewed effort can succeed, especially with continued bipartisan backing and public support for a regulated market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their proposal is expected to be introduced when the General Assembly reconvenes in January. It will likely reignite debate over cannabis reform in Virginia, as lawmakers weigh economic benefits, public health concerns, and the political landscape leading up to the 2025 gubernatorial elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d never say never, but I also realize that the governor has been pretty adamantly against the bill,” Krizek said. “I still think we have to do it, it would be legislative malpractice to not give it another try.” </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a new presidential administration taking office in January, Gov. Glenn Youngkin expressed optimism about potential fiscal benefits for Virginia, even as Democratic lawmakers voiced concerns about looming challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am so looking forward to having a period of tailwinds that will come out of Washington,” Youngkin said Wednesday following his budget proposal presentation in Richmond, signaling confidence in President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has indicated plans to bring back the 2017 corporate tax cuts, raise tariffs on imported goods, and cut federal jobs, sparking debate among Virginia lawmakers over potential impacts. Discussions also touched on federal Medicaid cuts, which could significantly affect the state’s healthcare funding.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking during a joint session of the General Assembly’s money committees, Virginia’s Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings mixed corporate income tax trends, noting that while refunds tied to corporate tax payments were slightly up, corporate tax revenues are down by $177.4 million compared to the same time last year. Cummings cited an uptick in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/08/15/youngkin-taxes-corporation-refunds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate tax refunds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a contributing factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve actually built in on corporate income tax a very conservative corporate tax view, reflecting some of the things that have taken place to date,” Cummings said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin defended tariffs as a way to ensure “America gets good deals first with our adversaries,” noting that the policy, first implemented by Trump during his first term, has continued under President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I am seeing as a result of the discussion around tariffs is a literal line of businesses that want to invest in America, and particularly in Virginia,” Youngkin said, though he did not provide specific examples. “I think we’re going to see another level of growth here in the commonwealth as a result.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit think tank, projects that while tariffs </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-revenue-estimates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between $2 billion and $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034, they would also increase the cost of goods. This could result in an average annual tax burden of $1,253 to $2,045 per U.S. household over the same period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, expressed concerns over the broader application of tariffs compared to previous policies, which were more focused on China. “That’s a distinct difference from 2016 when it was more targeted on certain countries,” Hayes said. “Now we’re hearing about a more broad application.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings defended the previous tariffs, arguing that they contributed to economic growth despite targeting basic goods like steel and aluminum, which have widespread effects on manufacturing. “I don’t think you can really separate the two,” Cummings said, referring to the different types of tariffs being proposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, Democrats have touted improvements in the economy, pointing to a steady decline in inflation since its pandemic-era peak. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by another 0.25%, attributing the move to favorable economic conditions resulting from current policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon-King, D-Prince William, raised concerns about the potential economic impact of federal job cuts, which would disproportionately affect Northern Virginia, home to a significant portion of the state’s federal workforce. A George Mason University analysis released before the election </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/trump-government-cuts-could-cost-house-republicans-majority-.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that eliminating 100,000 positions could result in an annual loss of $27-28 billion for Virginia’s economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s very definitely on the radar screen,” Cummings said, acknowledging the potential effects of such “very aggressive actions” on Virginia’s more than 200,000 federal workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings noted that while federal jobs represent a small percentage of Virginia’s 4.2 million workers, their loss would still be felt. ”It’s not insignificant, but it’s not huge,” he said, adding that the private sector could potentially absorb displaced workers, given Virginia’s low 2.9% unemployment rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, expressed concerns about the potential for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal cuts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Medicaid expansion program’s funding match, emphasizing the importance of maintaining coverage for Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s an incredible benefit to having all Virginians insured,” Favola said, noting the link between health insurance and workforce participation. “I would hope the administration would be very amenable to continuing, at a minimum, our policy of insurance remains as many Virginians need insurance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings assured lawmakers that the state is prepared for potential Medicaid funding challenges. “We have fully provided for all the liabilities that we know of around Medicaid, and built in growth in our five-year plan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic leaders, who control the House of Delegates and the state Senate, said Wednesday they are still reviewing Youngkin’s budget proposals ahead of negotiations set to begin when the legislative session starts on Jan. 8.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin presents his proposed amendments to the state's biennial budget before a joint meeting of the Virginia General Assembly's money committees in Richmond on Wednesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the cusp of his last full year in office, Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping budget proposal that he hopes will define his legacy as Virginia’s 74th governor. Focused on tax cuts, infrastructure, education, and public health, the plan sets the stage for what could be a high-stakes 2025 legislative session as lawmakers weigh his ambitious priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We reopened Virginia’s economy after a global pandemic all while delivering surplus after surplus,” Youngkin said during a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees in Richmond. “Virginia is growing, Virginia is leading, and Virginia is winning. And this morning I ask you to join me in continuing that work together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized the state’s strong economic performance, pointing to job growth, corporate investment, and robust revenue increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The stock market is strong, and the Federal Reserve appears poised to reduce interest rates over the next year,” he said. “This backdrop further supports Virginia’s ongoing strong performance, with year-to-date revenues up 7.3% over 2024.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlighting more than $5 billion in tax cuts already delivered to Virginians over the last three years, Youngkin proposed additional measures to lower the cost of living. “Together, the commonwealth can make a clear statement that reducing tax burdens so Virginians can keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets is not a Republican idea, it’s not a Democrat idea, it’s just common sense,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cornerstone in Youngkin’s proposed revisions to the two-year budget is a renewed push to eliminate the locally imposed personal car tax, an issue that he first came to embrace earlier this year after two Democrats campaigning for legislative seats in Southwest Virginia </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/10/13/two-virginia-democrats-embrace-a-former-republican-governors-signature-policy-eliminate-the-car-tax/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of their platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car tax has been a Republican rallying point since 1997, when GOP gubernatorial nominee Jim Gilmore successfully campaigned on repealing the unpopular levy. However, without a clear plan during the 2024 legislative session, the proposal quickly fizzled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, Youngkin once again urged the General Assembly to abolish what he called Virginia’s “most hated tax since the tax on tea” that he said cost the average Virginia family of four about $290 annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Standing here today, I will renew my call for us to work to fully eliminate the car tax, but recognizing that this might not be possible in this short session, there is an incremental step that we should take together to provide additional car tax relief,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new proposal, the state would deposit $1.1 billion into a car tax credit fund to provide income tax rebates to nearly 1.9 million taxpayers earning up to $50,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals or $100,000 for couples filing jointly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible taxpayers would receive up to $150 for individual returns or $300 for joint returns annually for the next three years. After the fund is exhausted, the state would see a permanent reduction of $360 million in tax revenues each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also is asking the legislature to extend the standard deductions for state income tax returns — currently set at  $8,500 for individuals and $17,000 for joint filers — that are set to expire at the end of next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to make the standard deduction permanent before Jan. 1, 2026, would result in tax increases of $57 million in fiscal year 2026 and $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2027, the governor said. “My friends, there is no reason to raise taxes on Virginians. We are running surplus after surplus after surplus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers responded cautiously to Youngkin’s budget plan Wednesday, emphasizing the need to review the details before committing to any initiatives. With the legislative session set to begin in January, both the House and Senate are preparing to roll out their own budget amendment proposals, signaling potential negotiations ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our focus will remain on targeted investments that benefit all Virginians,” said House Appropriations Chair Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William. “We will explore how we can work across the aisle to ensure K-12 schools are fully funded, higher education is accessible, and affordable housing becomes a reality for more families. These are areas where we can and should find common ground.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, in a statement thanked Youngkin for presenting his budget and for “initiating this important conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, our responsibility is to evaluate these proposals thoughtfully and collaboratively to ensure they reflect the priorities of all Virginians. We can craft a budget that strengthens our schools, supports our communities, and provides real solutions for working families,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate’s president pro tempore, said that while her chamber will consider his proposal, the Democrats’ amendments will look different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Senate budget will provide relief to working families and individuals and invest in their education and well-being, while maintaining the commonwealth&#8217;s long-term fiscal health,” Lucas said. “Here in the Senate, we look beyond elections and talk-show appearances and budget for the long-haul.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other key initiatives in Youngkin’s proposed budget amendments:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘No tax on tips’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration is also proposing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/16/youngkin-pitches-tax-relief-for-tipped-workers-in-budget-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to eliminate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state taxes on tips for service industry workers, a policy similar to one championed by President-elect Donald Trump. If approved, the measure would allow tipped workers to claim a deduction on their state tax returns, with compliance monitored through IRS data and employer-reported W-2 forms. The proposal could benefit an estimated 250,000 Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has an incredible hospitality, restaurant and service industry, and hardworking Virginians should keep every penny of the tips they earn through their exceptional service. My proposal is very simple — no more taxes on tips,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the move is being framed as a win for workers, its broader implications remain unclear. Economists warn that some employers might exploit the policy by shifting more of a worker’s compensation to tips rather than wages, a concern </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-and-harris-say-theyll-kill-taxes-on-tips-how-would-that-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also raised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around similar federal legislation. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is proposing nearly $1 billion in new education funding, including a $50-million Virginia Opportunity Scholarship Program to provide $5,000 annual grants for private school expenses like tuition and transportation. About 10,000 K-12 students from families earning up to twice the federal poverty limit to qualify for free school meals would qualify, with funding coming from revenue growth, not existing education budgets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan includes $25 million for lab school partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities and nearly $500 for higher education capital projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is no new funding for college operating expenses, and Youngkin is pushing for a 2.5% cap on tuition increases. “It’s time for our colleges to cut administrative bloat and handle costs without asking taxpayers for more,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional proposals include $290 million for school construction, $550 million in direct aid, $6.8 million for school resource officers, and $50 million to support underperforming schools. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">VMSDEP</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/jlarc-review-of-vmsdep-no-evidence-of-peak-or-decline-in-participation-levels/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(VMSDEP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides tuition waivers to spouses and children of military members killed or permanently disabled in service, would receive $60 million from a surplus in the state’s 529 college savings program to address a funding shortfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers scrutinized the program last year after it was initially excluded from budget negotiations. Concerns over its sustainability arose as participation surged by nearly 350%, growing from about 1,400 participants in 2019 to about 6,400 in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allocation would come without any new policy proposals.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Withholding funds to quash ‘sanctuary cities’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin further echored national Republican rhetoric by declaring that “every state has become a border state” as he unveiled plans to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-wants-to-restrict-funding-for-localities-that-dont-comply-with-immigration-enforcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to localities that limit or refuse compliance with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal aligns with a broader GOP push against “sanctuary city” policies, which vary but often involve local governments choosing not to inquire about immigration status or declining full cooperation with ICE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Virginia’s legislature under Democratic control, this proposal is expected to face significant opposition during the upcoming budget negotiations.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boosting maternal health outcomes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Democratic lawmakers are prioritizing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their legislative and budget </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/17/in-bipartisan-push-virginia-lawmakers-target-rural-healthcare-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increasing the chances that some measures will make it through budget negotiations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s plan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-unveils-plan-to-improve-maternal-health-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes $2.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for perinatal health hubs, expanded funding for OB-GYN residencies, and a $500,000 education campaign to help parents recognize life threatening conditions like heart attacks or eclampsia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also proposes $1 million to support workforce development for midwives and doulas, both crucial professions in addressing care gaps and advocating for patients, particularly those of color impacted by racial health disparities. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mental health support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia enters its third year of its Right Help, Right Now initiative, Youngkin’s latest budget request includes </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/meet-people-where-they-are-special-teams-aid-va-s-efforts-to-expand-mental-health-care-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$35 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve crisis response involving law enforcement. The funding would support hiring </span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/licensure-and-regulatory-affairs/special-conservators-peace" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special conservators of the peace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or “s-cops,” as Youngkin calls them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These intermediaries would assist with individuals awaiting hospital admissions after mental health crises, aiming to de-escalate situations where people in crisis might unintentionally harm  officers and face jail time. Youngkin envisions the “s-cops” fostering better outcomes for those in crisis while allowing law enforcement officers to focus on their regular duties.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disaster relief</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration proposes allocating $127 million toward a permanent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disaster relief fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to aid victims of natural disasters beyond what the federal assistance, insurance and private donations cover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southwest Virginia has faced repeated flooding in recent years, most recently from Hurricane Helene in September, which claimed three lives and caused $4.4 billion in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/va-dept-of-transportation-estimates-hurricane-helene-debris-cleanup-will-take-3-to-6-months/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Youngkin said $25 million could come from the general fund, with $102 million sourced from the latest round of revenues of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had previously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/20/judge-deems-youngkins-actions-to-withdraw-virginia-from-rggi-unlawful/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sought to withdraw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia from RGGI, despite praise from environmental groups for its funding for flood resilience and energy efficiency programs. “I fully expect that the General Assembly will work constructively together in this next short session to appropriate funds specifically for Hurricane Helene relief,” he said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, questioned the governor’s proposal, pointing to his approach of using RGGI revenues. “Why not just put us back in RGGI?” she asked, while noting uncertainty about the fund’s legislative support.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t know yet,” she said in an interview. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin serves coffee to patrons at McLean's Restaurant in Richmond after announcing a "no-tax-on-tips" budget proposal on Dec. 16, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin served more than pancakes and coffee at McLean’s Restaurant in Richmond Monday morning. He also unveiled another key part of his budget proposal: eliminating state taxes on tipped employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describing the measure as a “foundational piece” of his budget, which he is expected to present before a joint meeting of the legislature’s money committees on Wednesday, Youngkin emphasized the need to ease financial pressures, stating “It is time for us to reduce tax burdens on hard working Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 250,000 people working in food service and hospitality could see tax relief under the plan, according to the Virginia Department of Taxation and the Virginia Employment Commission. Tipped workers would be able to claim a deduction on their state tax returns, with compliance ensured through IRS data and employer-reported W-2 information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal must still get approval from the General Assembly as lawmakers and the governor work toward an amended biennial state budget during the upcoming legislative session, which begins in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is running for governor in 2025 and joined Youngkin at the announcement, expressed optimism about the policy, suggesting that Virginia could be the first state to implement such a measure if approved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think this should be bipartisan,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the leading Democrat in the state Senate who chairs the finance committee, did not have a comment at the time of this publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s push to eliminate state taxes on tips mirrors discussions at the federal level, where the idea gained traction during the fall campaign season. Both President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris floated similar proposals, and </span><a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/08/13/horsford-announces-bill-to-make-sure-high-end-earners-cant-exploit-an-end-to-tax-on-tips/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">related bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been introduced </span><a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/legislative-documents/proposed-legislation/s-4621-no-tax-tips-act/7kgn8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Congress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While eliminating taxes on tips might seem like a clear win for workers, the policy’s broader impact remains uncertain. Economists have raised concerns that some employers could exploit the measure by shifting more of a worker’s compensation to tips rather than wages, a possibility also </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-and-harris-say-theyll-kill-taxes-on-tips-how-would-that-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as similar  national legislation has been filed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about this concern, Youngkin acknowledged variations across the food service industry. “It depends, of course, on the establishment,” he said. “But, we see a substantial portion of our waiters and waitresses earnings in the form of tips, and this is a great way for us to say that ‘You keep that money.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the preview of his upcoming budget presentation on Wednesday, Youngkin also announced </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-wants-to-restrict-funding-for-localities-that-dont-comply-with-immigration-enforcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cut funding to localities that limit or refuse compliance with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal aligns with a broader GOP-led national movement to counter “sanctuary city” policies. These policies vary but often involve local governments opting not to ask about an individual&#8217;s immigration status or refusing to fully cooperate with ICE. However, with Virginia’s legislature under Democratic control, the proposal is likely to face significant resistance during the upcoming budget negotiations. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Tuesday announced that he is asking the legislature for an additional $290 million to support school construction and modernization efforts across Virginia. This latest investment would bring the total funding for the current biennium to $700 million and raise the state’s overall contribution under Youngkin’s administration to nearly $2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s funding request is included in his proposed budget amendments, which he plans to present next week at a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the governor’s office, the state’s financial commitments have spurred an estimated $3.4 billion in total funding for school construction. The additional support would be made possible through a combination of local government contributions and federal matching funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the last three years, we have invested historic amounts in our education system, including our public school facilities,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Our record economic growth and the resulting surplus allows us to make this critical investment to ensure every Virginia student has access to high-quality school facilities that support academic success.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin plans to use the newly announced $290 million in non-general funds to expand competitive grant opportunities for school divisions, particularly in high-need areas. The money would also address critical infrastructure issues, supporting the construction and renovation of schools in urgent need of repair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials say the increased funding will provide K-12 students with safer, more conducive learning spaces, a move that has been welcomed by educators and community leaders alike. Local school divisions will be able to apply for grant support to fast-track modernization projects that may have been delayed due to funding shortfalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration has framed the initiative as part of a broader effort to support Virginia&#8217;s educational system and improve outcomes for students. As schools across the state face aging infrastructure and capacity challenges, this investment aims to reduce disparities in facility quality, especially in underserved areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of our guiding principles since day one of the Youngkin Administration has been to provide safe, vibrant, and healthy learning environments for all of our students,” said Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This investment in supporting new and refurbished school buildings makes it possible for every community in the commonwealth to have the means to provide a best-in-class education that prepares every student for success in our increasingly demanding knowledge- and skills-based economy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, a member of the Commission on School Construction and Modernization, said that while she welcomed Youngkin’s proposal, she needed more information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been screaming from the rooftops about more money for school construction and ensuring that localities have what they need, so I’m glad to see that he&#8217;s trying to get on board,” Mundon King said. </span></p>

Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, is a member of the Commission on School Construction and Modernization (Courtesy Candi Mundon King).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is clear that we need to put more money into school construction, but I can’t say more without seeing a fully fleshed out plan. So I’m looking forward to his presentation next week with the joint money committees so we can fully evaluate what this proposal actually is, and not just some slick press release that doesn’t go into detail.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Youngkin’s first year in office, the General Assembly in a bipartisan effort approved a historic $1.2 billion investment in school construction, aiming to modernize aging facilities and reduce funding disparities among school divisions. The sweeping plan combined grants and loans to support renovations, new construction, and capacity expansion for K-12 schools across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the $1.2 billion, about $850 million was allocated for grants. This included $400 million in formula-based grants, which provided each of Virginia’s 134 school divisions with a $1 million base allocation. The remaining $266 million was distributed based on the Local Composite Index (LCI) — a state funding formula that considers factors like property values, taxable sales and population data to assess a locality’s financial ability to support its schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another $450 million was funneled into the newly created School Construction Fund and Program, a competitive grant program designed to assist divisions with the most critical infrastructure needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School systems with poor building conditions and limited financial capacity could apply for these funds to support construction, renovation, or expansion projects. This program is primarily funded by 98% of gaming revenue from Virginia’s four new casinos in Bristol, Danville, Portsmouth, and Norfolk. The fund is administered by the Virginia Board of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia faces a mounting crisis with school infrastructure. Data released by the Virginia Department of Education in 2022 revealed that nearly 1,000 school buildings across the state are at least 50 years old. Replacing these facilities would cost more than $25 billion — a figure far beyond the capacity of most localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, local governments have shouldered the financial burden of school construction, relying on local tax revenue. But for economically distressed areas, particularly in Southwest Virginia and Southside, this has become an increasingly difficult challenge due to population decline and economic hardship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in April, Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-vetoes-measure-to-let-va-localities-increase-sales-tax-to-pay-for-school-construction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawmakers sent to his desk that would have allowed localities to implement a 1% sales tax to help cover the costs of school construction and modernization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required voter approval through a referendum before the tax could be enacted by local governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin acknowledged that school construction is a “worthy cause” but argued that Virginia has already taken substantial steps to address those costs. He contended that citizens should not face additional taxes, particularly the $1.5 billion annually that would have been raised by the 1% sales tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The commonwealth should pursue a tax policy that unleashes economic development and prioritizes job and wage growth through innovative reforms,” Youngkin said in his </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+SB14AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “These reforms must allow hardworking Virginians to keep more of their money, not less; any proposal that increases the cost of living and the cost of business is not a policy we should pursue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2022, state assistance for school construction was limited, with much of it coming from the Literary Fund, a state-managed pool of money established in Virginia’s Constitution. Funded by sources such as unclaimed lottery winnings, criminal fines, and unclaimed property, the Literary Fund historically provided low-interest loans to support school construction and debt service for technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in recent years, much of the fund’s revenue was redirected to cover teacher retirement costs, leaving fewer resources for school building projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 legislative session retooled the Literary Fund’s loan program, significantly increasing its impact. Lawmakers raised the maximum loan amount from $7.5 million to $25 million and capped the interest rate at 2%. These changes made it more feasible for school divisions to finance major construction projects at a lower cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the state’s total contribution now approaching $2 billion, education advocates are hopeful the increased funding will lead to long-term improvements in school facilities and better learning conditions for students throughout the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Board of Education President Grace Creasey said Tuesday that the panel will prioritize “those school divisions in greatest need that have missed out on prior grant opportunities,” especially rural divisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also know that school divisions are eager to adopt seat time flexibility and competency-based models which requires us to design learning environments and spaces differently. This new investment will make this possible,” Creasey said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city council is now calling on the Richmond Electoral Board to review the findings and issue a response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Richmond City Council strives to ensure that taxpayer resources are used in an efficient and effective manner. The Richmond Office of Inspector General’s findings of the use of public resources in the Richmond Office of Elections raises serious concerns,” the council said in a joint statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richmond’s Inspector General James Osuna </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/richmond-inspector-general-investigating-citys-elections-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched the probe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in May after one of his investigators contacted the Department of Elections last year to seek assistance with complaints from a former employee of Balmer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to documents obtained by The Mercury earlier this year through a Freedom of Information Act request, the employee had shared unverified allegations of management issues, including “hiring family and friends,” questionable spending, and other concerns within the Richmond election office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osuna declined to comment for this story, and Balmer did not respond to phone calls and emails. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37663" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/keith-balmer-cropped_provided/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-37663" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Keith-Balmer-cropped_provided--300x244.png" alt="" width="300" height="244" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Keith-Balmer-cropped_provided--300x244.png 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Keith-Balmer-cropped_provided--1024x832.png 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Keith-Balmer-cropped_provided--768x624.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Keith-Balmer-cropped_provided-.png 1076w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Keith Balmer, General Registrar of the City of Richmond. (Courtesy of Keith Balmer)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials initially believed the State Board of Elections should address the complaints due to its statewide oversight of registrars. However, state officials determined the matter was a local issue, because the allegations did not directly involve election policy or voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claims of nepotism in the Richmond election office had surfaced publicly on another occasion. Earlier this year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/richmond-registrar-keith-balmer-nepotism-accusations-brother-wife-office-of-elections/article_e0eb9052-d738-11ee-9abd-7bef8c0bbd32.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that Balmer hired his brother and paid $2,300 to his wife’s company for training election workers on accommodating voters with disabilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osuna&#8217;s investigation confirmed that Balmer violated procurement policies and misused government resources by hiring a security company between January and May without proper authorization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Originally contracted to provide a $50-per-hour security guard for early voting, the agreement expanded to include personal protection services at $85 per hour, emergency training, and equipment purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the company billed the city more than $200,000, depleting the Office of Elections’ budget and prompting Balmer to seek additional funding from Richmond City Council.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Osuna also found that Balmer misused public funds by hiring a private security firm to investigate alleged election interference, violating Virginia law. The registrar allegedly authorized the firm to probe claims that two former employees tried to discourage election officers from participating in future elections, costing the city more than $4,400 for services like background checks and evidence review.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer falsely claimed that the city attorney had approved the investigation, but it was later determined that the latter had not been consulted. He also bypassed law enforcement and other relevant authorities, using city funds for a private investigation instead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between August and November 2023, Balmer violated procurement policies by approving a remodel of a leased building without following required bidding procedures, the investigation found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project, which included carpet and flooring replacement, wall repairs, electrical work and a remodeled bathroom, was done using a contractor preferred by the landlord, bypassing the necessary competitive bidding process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the city’s lease agreement, which places maintenance responsibility on the landlord, Balmer approved the project without proper documentation, including quotes from multiple vendors, Osuna wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work was divided into 21 separate purchase orders, each under the $50,000 threshold to avoid triggering a competitive bidding requirement, totaling $229,969. This strategy violated city policies governing small purchases and split purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remodel was done without the landlord’s approval or building permits, and the project cost exceeded the amount allowed for non-competitive bidding. The Deputy General Registrar, who oversees the budget, was unaware of the total cost of the work, the investigation found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On July 5, 2023, Balmer failed to report a workplace domestic violence incident involving two city employees, the probe confirmed. The incident occurred at the annual Voter Registrars Association of Virginia Conference, where one temporary employee was arrested for domestic assault against their partner, a full-time city employee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon returning from the conference, the victim was unreachable, prompting a welfare check. The Office of Elections received notice of the incident, and the Employee Relations manager reached out to Balmer for assistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Balmer’s awareness of the situation — which included prior reports of domestic conflict in the workplace — he did not take action, as required under the city code, Osuna found. Instead, he pressured the assaulted employee to resign, claiming safety concerns, without consulting Human Resources or the city attorney, which led to the alleged victim being denied unemployment benefits. </span></p>
<a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Report-Office-of-ELections.pdf" class="pdfemb-viewer" style="" data-width="max" data-height="max" data-toolbar="bottom" data-toolbar-fixed="off">Report Office of ELections</a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer also violated city regulations by spending $7,500 to hire three Virginia Commonwealth University students to paint murals in the lobby of a city-leased facility and by purchasing more than $8,700 worth of artwork without proper authorization, according to the investigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The murals, completed between February and December of last year, were paid for using invoice payment forms, with each student receiving $2,500. Additionally, Balmer used a government P-Card to buy 12 art pieces from a local art center, with prices ranging from $175 to $1,800. None of the purchases followed the required Department of Procurement Services (DPS) procedures for exempted artwork.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One allegation claimed that Balmer improperly purchased a Ford Explorer for the Office of Elections in February 2023 without Fleet Management authorization and removed city logos from the vehicle in violation of policy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the investigation confirmed that the purchase followed proper city procedures, and the city’s fleet manager approved the removal of the logos at the General Registrar’s request due to safety concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Balmer still violated city policies when he used a city vehicle for personal errands, transporting non-city personnel, and as a take-home vehicle without authorization, according to the investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer assumed control of the Richmond election office after former registrar Kirk Showalter </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/richmond-electoral-board-votes-to-remove-citys-top-election-official-after-tense-public-hearing/article_ff22c0fd-1ceb-5e40-8458-9db8430d9605.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was removed in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, partly due to pressure from the Democratic Party of Virginia. While the Richmond Electoral Board is now under Republican control following Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s 2021 victory, the shift in power did not affect Balmer’s position.</span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump’s return to the White House following the Nov. 5 election is already sending ripples through Virginia politics and setting the stage for an intense 2025 election cycle in the commonwealth. With control of the governorship and the House of Delegates on the line, both parties are strategizing to leverage the shifting political landscape to their advantage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we’re in a crucial moment in Virginia’s history, this is a moment where every single vote, every election and every voice can make a lasting difference, especially after the election of Donald Trump,” Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, said on a video call with reporters on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2017 elections in Virginia offer a compelling precedent. That year — Trump’s first in office —  galvanized the Democratic base, leading to a stunning 15-seat gain in the House and leaving the Republicans with a razor-thin 50–49 advantage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suburban districts that had long been Republican strongholds, including in the Richmond area and in Northern Virginia, flipped blue as many moderate voters reacted against the president’s divisive rhetoric and policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Democrat Ralph Northam’s decisive victory in the gubernatorial race — he defeated Republican Ed Gillespie by a 9-point margin (54-45%) — underscored the state’s shift toward progressive politics, fueled by high turnout among women, young voters, and minorities united by their dislike for an incumbent president whom Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had defeated in the commonwealth with 49.75-44.43%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years later, in 2019, Democrats picked up six more seats in the House, marking the first time that the party held control of both legislative and executive branches in Virginia since 1993.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Trump’s recent win, Virginia Democrats are hoping for a similar wave in 2025, betting that the Republican’s polarizing presidency will once again energize their coalition. With abortion rights, climate policy, and education likely to be central issues, Democrats believe they can maintain their control of the legislature and win back the Executive Mansion by appealing to suburban and urban voters alarmed by Trump’s policies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things about Virginia is that you can never really predict what will happen, because Virginia voters are so in tune and aware of what’s going on. They don’t go for a lot of BS, which is why Virginia rejected Donald Trump three times,” Scott said, referring also to the presidential elections in 2020 and 2024, which Trump lost in the commonwealth. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians, Scott said, pay “very close attention to what happens in DC right now,” and they will take note if Trump keeps his promise to abolish the U.S. Department of Education or eliminate federal jobs in Northern Virginia — actions that could fire up the Democratic party’s base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans, on the other hand, are hoping for a reverse dynamic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s successful third White House bid has emboldened Virginia conservatives, particularly in rural areas where his support remains robust, and the GOP campaigns of next year are likely to focus on economic issues and a law-and-order message to woo suburban voters who have drifted toward Democrats in recent cycles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Republican Party of Virginia and Trump very handily carried a number of Virginia House of Delegates districts that either Republicans lost by a small amount last year or won by a small amount,” Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Virginia GOP, said in a recent phone interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So it’s going to be vital for us next year to take those Republicans who showed up for President Trump and to get them out in the 2025 election cycle. We will work hard in doing that because next year is a crucial year for us in the House of Delegates elections, and the Democrats only have a one seat margin. If we work hard, then we can flip it back, and that, of course, helps our nominees for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that the current Democratic majorities in the House of Delegates (51-49) and the state Senate (21-19) are too close for either party to relax. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If Virginia acts like 2021, where it voted against the party in power in Washington, then the GOP will have an uphill climb,” Richards said. “The question is how far along Trump’s agenda will be by the fall of 2025. If things are going well, the GOP could draft on that success, but if things are chaotic, then that will be a problem.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy House Minority Leader Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, said that Republicans plan to seize on a lagging enthusiasm among Democratic voters this year in order to flip the House in 2025. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30127" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022-ga-2-6/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30127" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-6-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-6-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-GA-2-6.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Israel O&#8217;Quinn, R-Washington, speaks on the floor of the House of Delegates. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These races are going on a race-by-race and a candidate-by-candidate basis, that’s why you have to put the work into the recruitment of quality candidates and make sure that you’re competitive in these really tight 50-50 House districts,” O’Quinn said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won 60 out of 100 House of Delegates seats, and in the following year Democrats were able to capitalize on 51 of those, O’Quinn added. “I think Kamala Harris won 59 this year, so they’re going to have to run the table on all 51 to be able to continue to hold on to the majority, and I think we’re going to be very competitive there.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And less than one year before Virginia’s 2025 gubernatorial election and more than six months before the party primaries, the contest is effectively set, with two high-profile candidates leading the major-party tickets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, was the first </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/spanberger-virginia-governor-candidacy-c19ade683ab0dfaef67051b36791d30a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to announce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her bid in November of last year, positioning herself as a centrist with a focus on pragmatic leadership. Outgoing Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney, followed suit one month later, but in April he opted to pursue the lieutenant governor’s seat instead, streamlining Spanberger’s path to the nomination.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_36863" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=36863" rel="attachment wp-att-36863"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-36863" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF6603-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  U.S. Rep.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Republicans, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears emerged as the party’s standard-bearer after Attorney General Jason Miyares </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/18/miyares-to-seek-second-term-as-virginia-attorney-general/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared on Monday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> he would seek reelection rather than enter the governor’s race. Earle-Sears, who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/06/lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-announces-run-for-virginia-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched her campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September, is set to carry the GOP banner unopposed, benefiting from Miyares’ decision to focus on being reelected into his current role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite her re-embrace of Trump as the Republican presidential nominee, the lieutenant governor’s campaign may still be haunted by her remarks from November 2022, when she publicly urged Americans to move on from the former president.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A true leader understands when they have become a liability. A true leader understands that it’s time to step off the stage. And the voters have given us that very clear message,” Earle-Sears </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/virginia-lt-gov-earle-sears-time-to-move-on-from-trump/3205900/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said in a TV interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richards, the political science professor, said that he expects the damning remarks to be brought up by political action committees aligned with Spanberger during the gubernatorial election cycle as a way to undermine Earle-Sears with Republicans.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She will need to make up quickly with Trump. Had Trump lost she would have been able to brush off her previous comments, but now she will need his support,” Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I suspect she will try to make nice. Her bigger hurdle will be convincing independent voters in Virginia she is not too extreme. Virginia is a purple state, and when it votes for the GOP it likes moderate-facing candidates, which is why Youngkin was careful to present himself that way in 2021.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A spokesman for Earle-Sears’ campaign declined to provide comment for this story. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30208" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/05/25/virginia-lg-scheduled-to-speak-at-nra-fundraising-event-in-texas-this-week/ga-2022-4-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-30208"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-30208" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-4-300x200.jpg" alt="Lt.

Gov. Winsome Sears presides over the Senate. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is little doubt that the match-up between Spanberger and Earle-Sears promises to be a defining battle of contrasting visions for Virginia’s future. Spanberger’s track record as a moderate in Congress and Earle-Sears’ bold embrace of conservative policies ensure the race will draw national attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger’s “2025 campaign will continue to be laser-focused on the priorities that all Virginians share — stronger schools, safer communities, and lower costs,” campaign spokesman Connor Joseph said “And following the election of former President Trump, she also knows that Virginia must have a governor who is committed to protecting the rights and fundamental freedoms of all Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ernest McGowen, an associate professor at the Department of Political Science at the University of Richmond, said that Earle-Sears will likely face an uphill battle in a state that has increasingly voted for Democrats in statewide elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Earle-Sears may be a little too far right. If you look at Tim Kane and the kind of people that he had to run against, I think it may be kind of a similar situation,” McGowen said, referring to the Democratic U.S. senator from Virginia who has won his two reelection bids by fending of challenges from Republican nominees whose far-right positions have helped their primary campaigns but hurt their chances of winning a general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Also, Spanberger is more of a known commodity,” McGowen said. “If the Democrats in their election postmortem decide that their current ideological median isn’t isn&#8217;t where they thought it should be, I could see them actually really get behind Spanberger as not the new face of the party, but as someone to show the diversity of thought in the party.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2025 race for Virginia’s attorney general is also starting to take form, with three candidates having officially declared their bids. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After securing Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://x.com/glennyoungkin/status/1858574435449446657?s=46&amp;t=uQxq3EX7p3bygcqVfUnstg" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">endorsement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just moments after his announcement Monday, Miyares is unlikely to face a challenger for his party’s nomination. If reelected, the incumbent has vowed to focus on public safety and his record combating fentanyl and violent crime during a second term.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Democrats, the field features a competitive primary between former Del. Jay Jones, who previously ran in 2021, and Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor. Jones has criticized Miyares for what he calls a “partisan agenda,” while Taylor has emphasized her decades of experience as a prosecutor dedicated to justice and public safety.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lieutenant governor’s contest, however, remains wide open almost one year out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">James City County business consultant and U.S. Navy veteran John Curran — who </span><a href="https://www.dailypress.com/2023/09/23/majority-of-jcc-supervisor-seats-up-for-grabs/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ran unsuccessfully for the Board of Supervisors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2023 — is the only Republican </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/09/27/james-city-county-business-consultant-to-run-for-lieutenant-governor-as-republican/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">who has filed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his paperwork to date, but the Democratic field is more crowded. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Stoney, three additional candidates are vying for their party’s nomination: state Sens. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach; and Babur Lateef, the former chairman of the Prince William County School Board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But officials from both parties agree on one thing — the 2025 elections will likely serve as a referendum on Trump’s second term and provide a key barometer for the 2026 midterms and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It goes without saying that the Democrats will definitely be energized, because they have an intense dislike for President Trump,” said Anderson, the RPV chair. “The challenge for Republicans next year is being smarter and better equipped in 2025 than maybe we were in 2017, when we lost all those seats in the House of Delegates.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And House Speaker Scott expressed confidence in his party’s ability to harness its base’s enthusiasm and channel it into meaningful action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will stand up and we will fight, and I think the majority of Virginians will stand with us and push back against this administration,” Scott said. “I think that next year’s election will be that type of referendum on Donald Trump’s administration.” </span></p>

Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares announced Monday that he will seek reelection in 2025, putting to rest speculation that he might enter the Republican primary for governor. His decision effectively clears the way for Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears to secure her party’s nomination for the state’s top job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I serve as the people’s protector,” Miyares said of his role as the state’s top lawyer in an </span><a href="https://x.com/JasonMiyaresVA/status/1858570888251404777" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">X post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcing his reelection campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlighting his aspirations for another four years as attorney general, Miyares pointed to key public safety initiatives he has championed, including the “One Pill Can Kill” campaign to raise awareness about fentanyl overdoses and his office’s work with “Ceasefire Virginia,” a program that combines prosecution efforts with community engagement to combat crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Miyares </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/article_2b71d3a4-e6d7-11ee-8831-93f7ac7b8121.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrated crime reductions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> associated with the initiative. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares’ campaign launch comes roughly a week after Democratic candidate </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/12/former-virginia-delegate-jay-jones-launches-second-bid-for-attorney-general/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Jones announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> his latest bid for the position. Jones lost a Democratic primary to former Attorney General Mark Herring in 2021, who later went on to lose to Miyares later that year in the general election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Miyares hadn’t officially announced yet, Jones took a jab at Miyares last week — accusing him of using his office to “attack Virginians’ freedoms, pander to the fringes of his own party and side with corporate price gougers and polluters” at the cost of Virginia families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moments after Miyares’ announcement, Gov. Glenn Youngkin also turned to X to endorse the attorney general and Earle-Sears for next year’s Republican ticket. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As attorney general, Jason vigorously defends the laws of the commonwealth, stands with law enforcement every single day while leading our shared fight to end the free flow of opioids and fentanyl into our communities, and has been a constant advocate for victims of human trafficking and domestic violence,” Youngkin wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He has never backed down when it comes to standing up for Virginians. He is an exceptional attorney general.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also hailed Earle-Sears — a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/06/lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-announces-run-for-virginia-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">declared her bid</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s highest office in September and would likely face U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger — as “an outstanding” lieutenant governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She will be a great governor. She has been an outspoken advocate for commonsense conservative principles and policies, a passionate voice for our military and veterans, and a relentless advocate for educational freedom and economic opportunity. She brings the fighting spirit of a Marine to the office every single day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earle-Sears said in a statement that she was “deeply honored” to receive Youngkin’s endorsement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Together with our outstanding attorney general, Jason Miyares, we will continue championing common-sense safety and security policies that keep Virginia the ‘Number 1 Best State for Business,’” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Miyares is so far the only Republican candidate vying for the seat, Jones will face Henrico Commonwealth Attorney Shannon Taylor in a primary. Miyares took aim at both on social media last week after Jones announced his bid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both of the announced (democratic) candidates for Attorney General are far-left, anti-police, criminal rights progressives who will make Virginia less safe. They will support the same criminal first, victim last policies that lead to a surge in violent crime,” Miyares wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He reiterated similar messaging in his re-election campaign launch video Monday, and said that in a second term he will continue to press for more tough-on-crime policies. Also during his time in office, Miyares has signed onto legal briefs with other Republican attorneys general </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/03/virginia-attorney-general-joins-efforts-to-fight-back-against-title-ix-changes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">challenging</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> President Joe Biden administration’s </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/08/01/biden-titleix-courts-gender-identity-discrimination/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Title IX rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> meant to protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her pushback to Miyares, Taylor noted her over 25 years of experience as a prosecutor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every day of every one of those years has been spent working with law enforcement to keep people safe and seeking justice for victims of crime and their families,” </span><a href="https://x.com/ShannonTaylorVA/status/1856481762563465512" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">she wrote on X</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with a repost of Miyares’ post. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Democratic Party of Virginia Chair Susan Swecker in a statement called Miyares “a MAGA mouthpiece in pushing an extreme agenda,” referring to President-elect Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign motto. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians deserve an attorney general who will stand up for their rights and freedoms, not someone who is constantly trying to take them away,” Swecker said. “It is clear that, if re-elected, Miyares would use his office as a partisan tool to serve the interests of the Trump administration, rather than the needs of hard-working Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said it was “a smart move” by Miyares to put his gubernatorial ambitions on hold and run for reelection next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There was no guarantee that he would prevail in a contest with the lieutenant governor. He can run for reelection now and legitimately claim the right to be first in line in 2029 for the party&#8217;s gubernatorial nomination,” Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Republican attorneys general end up running for governor consistently and sometimes have been able to prevail over Republican lieutenant governors because they are more explicitly conservative, that is not the case this time, Farnsworth said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current lieutenant governor is not an ideological moderate the way some Republican lieutenant governors have been in the past,” he said of Earle-Sears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats would likely have preferred a competition for the GOP’s gubernatorial nomination among the two Republican statewide office holders, Farnsworth added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If nothing else, a fight between Miyares and Winsome Earle-Sears would have put a lot of Republican money into the primary that otherwise would have been spent on a general election.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connor Joseph, a spokesman for Spanberger’s campaign, said that no matter who her eventual opponent is, the Democrat’s vision for Virginia remains the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Her 2025 campaign will continue to be focused on the priorities that all Virginians share — stronger schools, safer communities, and lower costs,” Joseph said. “Additionally, Abigail knows that Virginia must have a governor who is committed to protecting the rights and fundamental freedoms of all Virginians.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 22-member House Privileges and Elections Committee further backed amendments to extend constitutional protections to marriage equality and the automatic restoration of voting rights for felons who have served their time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The right to love, the right to vote, the right to bodily autonomy and privacy, these are the very rights and freedoms that are crucial to the foundation of this commonwealth and this nation,” committee chair Del. Marcia Price, D-Newport News, said in a brief news conference Wednesday afternoon. “We showed up today to do our jobs and to do everything within our power to protect these rights and freedoms for all Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised abortion amendment language in </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shocked the committee’s Republican members, who only saw the changes after the meeting was already underway. Price called a  five-minute recess to allow lawmakers to review the new language before deliberations and voting proceeded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I think we’re still trying to figure out what happened today,” a visibly frustrated House Minority Leader Del. Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said after the three-hour hearing. “Something this important and impactful — literally life-and-death decisions — I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything pushed through this fast where we didn’t get a chance to see it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gilbert warned that Price’s decision to not allow the committee more time to review the revised legislation would set a precedent for the way the House conducts its business in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were literally given five minutes to huddle and look at it before we had to decide what we were grappling with, and I think we still don’t know, other than it’s pretty clear that this is a pretty extreme version of efforts to protect abortion that goes well beyond what has been done in other states,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price, however, defended her decision to move forward with taking a vote on the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have an entire legislative process just like any other committee, and [the resolution] will go to the floor where (Republicans) will also have a chance to either put forward amendments or have their voice heard as well,” she said at the news conference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amending the state Constitution takes several years in Virginia. The proposed amendment must be approved by the legislature in two separate years, with a General Assembly election occurring in between. Only then can the amendment proceed to a statewide referendum for voters to decide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the next election in Virginia is in November 2025, the earliest the three amendments that the committee advanced Wednesday could be put on the ballot is November 2026 — if the measures pass in the 2025 and 2026 legislative sessions. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The abortion rights amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, third-trimester abortions require approval from three doctors. The new amendment would reduce this requirement to just one doctor when a late-term abortion is deemed necessary to protect the life of the pregnant individual, or their physical or mental health, or when a physician determines the fetus is not viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Wednesday’s hearing, dozens of abortion opponents lined up to speak against the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them was Olivia Turner, president of the Virginia Society for Human Life, who told the panel that her group opposed both the original amendment and its substitute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t know what’s going on with this new version, and how it will impact our ability as the people of Virginia to pass rational and reasonable protective laws in the future,” Turner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Gilbert, the House Minority Leader, said that the amendment capsized Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court case that established abortion as a constitutional right and that was repealed in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roe v. Wade has within it a compelling state interest in protecting the life of the unborn at a certain point in the pregnancy. This amendment doesn’t contain that protection at all, it leans in the other direction,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The legislation we just saw, which was dropped on us literally today without any ability to look at it, reflect on it, think about it, compare notes, talk to experts, only leans into the protection of the patient, which is the mother. And so there is no more protection for the unborn, which was envisioned and embodied in Roe (v.) Wade.”</span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, the sponsor of HJ1, said that in her amendment both the state interest in protecting the unborn and life of the mother are considered. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The parameters are set out so if there is a live fetus, there are protections. But if there is a miscarriage, then the physician and the mother will be able to make a decision to abort and to complete a miscarriage. So they do coexist,” Herring said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion rights advocates urged the committee to vote in favor of the amendment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This amendment will protect Virginians’ rights to make their own reproductive health care decisions, including access to abortion, contraception, fertility treatment and miscarriage care,” said Jamie Lockhart, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now, with no state or federal protections in place, Virginians face the constant risk that anti-abortion politicians could restrict or ban essential care. No one is more qualified than an individual and their health care provider to make these complex personal decisions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After defeating a Republican motion to kill the proposed amendment, the committee moved to advance the measure by a 12-9 party-line vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Restoration of rights amendment </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ2" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ2</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sponsored by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, seeks to automate the process of restoring voting rights to people convicted of felony crimes who have served their sentences. The proposal comes in response to a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/03/23/youngkin-administration-now-requires-felons-to-apply-to-get-their-voting-rights-back/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 policy change</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> implemented by Gov. Glenn Youngkin that requires people with felony convictions to proactively apply to regain their voting rights upon release from prison and is not automatically restoring rights for any group of offenders — a shift from Virginia’s three previous governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bennett-Parker told reporters Wednesday that her amendment proposes automatic restoration of voting rights for individuals who have been released from incarceration, which she said would foster “a more just and bare” society.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The disenfranchisement of people with all convictions is a relic of Virginia’s Jim Crow past and was intentionally inserted into the 1902 Virginia Constitution to disenfranchise as many Black voters as possible,” Bennett-Parker said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the right to vote is fundamental and the amendment ensures that if a person has served their time they deserve to have their rights to participate in democracy restored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is the only state to permanently disenfranchise all individuals with felony convictions unless they individually petition the governor for rights restoration. The current system has no transparency and changes every four years, so no one knows what steps to take to get their rights restored. This amendment creates a process that is bound by transparent rules and criteria that will apply equally to everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee backed HJ2 with a 12-9 party-line vote.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Marriage equality amendment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the U.S. Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry in the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling in 2014, the state Constitution still includes the 2006 Marshall-Newman Amendment, which defines marriage as solely between one man and one woman and bans recognition of any legal status that approximates “the design, qualities, significance, or effects of marriage.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because it could become law again should the Supreme Court overturn its 2014 ruling one day, Del. Mark Sickles, D-Arlington, sponsored </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HJ9" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ9</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in an effort to repeal the current constitutional provision and enshrine marriage as a “fundamental right inherent in the liberty of persons,” unrestricted by factors like sex, gender or race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Caruso, executive director of the Virginia Catholic Conference, told the committee that his group has opposed efforts to repeal the Marshall-Newman Amendment for more than 16 years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We affirm the dignity of every person, we also affirm that marriage has an original design and purpose, which predates any nation, any religion and any law, and we urge you to uphold that principle today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narissa Rahaman, executive director of Equality Virginia, pushed back against that notion and reminded the panel that today there are more than 20,000 same-sex couples in Virginia who have more similarities than differences with couples in traditional marriages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Here in Virginia we have seen how a state has evolved in its thinking about same-sex couples, and LGTBQ people overall. Now it’s time for our state to fully complete our evolution and finish the job in protecting marriage equality for all,” Rahaman said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee advanced the amendment on a bipartisan 16-5 vote, with four Republicans joining Democrats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think our straightforward amendment will be welcomed by Virginia citizens and I’m really appreciative of the vote today in the committee,” Sickles said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All three amendments are now set to be voted on by the General Assembly during its 2025 session, which begins in January. </span></p>

Walker Memorial Plaza in Richmond Tuesday. (Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jay Jones, a Democratic former state delegate from Norfolk, on Tuesday announced his bid for Virginia attorney general at two separate events in Norfolk and Richmond. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Jones, who represented the 89th District in the House of Delegates from 2019 to 2021, it marks his second run for his party’s nomination for attorney general. In 2021, he lost the Democratic primary to then-incumbent Mark Herring, despite an endorsement from former Gov. Ralph Northam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last week we awoke to an uncertain future and a president-elect who openly flouts the rule of law,” Jones said before a small crowd of supporters that had gathered at Maggie L. Walker Memorial Plaza in Richmond Tuesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With an incoming administration, families now face the threat of higher healthcare costs as (Donald) Trump seeks to kick tens of thousands of working Virginians off Medicaid and end the protections of the Affordable Care Act,” Jones said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also accused Attorney General Jason Miyares, the Republican incumbent and his potential opponent, of using his office “to attack Virginians’ freedoms, pander to the fringes of his own party and side with corporate price gougers and polluters” at the cost of Virginia families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s used his office to advance his own radical, personal, partisan-political agenda,” Jones said of Miyares. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Jones is one of two declared candidates in the 2025 attorney general’s race, alongside Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor. Miyares responded to Jones’ announcement Tuesday by calling out his potential opponents on social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both of the announced Democrat candidates for attorney general are far-left, anti-police, criminal rights progressives who will make Virginia less safe,” Miyares wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “They will support the same criminal first, victim last policies that lead to a surge in violent crime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares has yet to declare whether he will run for reelection or seek his party’s nomination for governor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his Richmond appearance, Jones declined to comment on the attorney general’s response to his announcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You have to ask him why he said that,” he said. “We’re focused on this campaign, whatever he says and whatever he tweets out, that’s him, and his campaign’s business.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones’s pre-legislature career includes a stint at Goldman Sachs in New York, where he specialized in risk management and credit advisory for natural resources and tech companies. After two years, he returned to Virginia, earning his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 2015. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While in law school, Jones interned for Del. Algie Howell, who represented the 90th House District from 2004 until 2014. Jones was elected to the body himself in 2017 after winning a competitive Democratic primary and defeating Libertarian candidate Terry Hurst in the general election, succeeding then-Del. Daun Hester, D-Norfolk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones said on Tuesday that he is running because Virginians need an attorney general who is focused on keeping the commonwealth safe instead of following a partisan agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As your attorney general, I will protect Virginia’s families, our children, and our most vulnerable,” he said. “We will crack down on those who would do our kids harm by working with law enforcement to get illegal guns off our streets, shut down drug traffickers and hold to account the gun manufacturers whose weapons of war are used to commit mass shootings and crimes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jones vowed to “go after the criminals that prey on children and our families and put them where they belong — behind bars,” and he promised to take on social media companies “fueling a mental health crisis among our young people” and corporations that pollute air and water. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And if the Trump administration again tries to raise the health care cost by taking apart the Affordable Care Act, I’ll be the first to take him to court to stop it,” Jones said, adding that he would always fight back against “any attempt to undermine abortion rights in Virginia” and use “the full weight of the office” to protect women and medical professionals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The House Privileges and Elections Committee is set to meet Wednesday to consider several proposed constitutional amendments, including one to guarantee access to abortion in Virginia and another to remove outdated language defining marriage solely as a union between a man and a woman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I will join the fight to enshrine these rights in our Constitution today,” Jones said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican officials in Virginia celebrated the former president’s national victory, hailing it as a mandate for their party’s agenda. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The American people have spoken overwhelmingly to return common sense, strength, and leadership back to the White House. Through the Trump presidency, we will pave the way for an economic revival, a secure border, and a stronger America on the world stage,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin did not comment on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/harris-triumphs-over-trump-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris’s victory in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Democrat defeated Trump by a 5-point margin, winning 51.8% to Trump’s 46.5%, a spread of nearly 225,000 votes from a total of about 4.3 million cast, according to unofficial data from the Virginia Department of Elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump claimed victory nationwide by securing 292 electoral votes to Harris’s 224, also winning the popular vote by a 4.8 million margin — the first Republican nominee to do so since President George W. Bush won reelection in 2004.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats, on the other hand, remained largely silent in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday’s election.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the few party leaders to address Virginians directly within hours after the Associated Press </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/06/dc/ap-former-president-donald-trump-wins-second-term/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">called the race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Trump was Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who despite the Democrats’ defeat in the race for the White House and the U.S. Senate expressed optimism about his state and how Democrats and Republicans can work together at the state level. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All politics are local, and I think we&#8217;ve begun to see that here in Virginia,” Scott told reporters outside the state capital in Richmond on Wednesday afternoon. “I think Virginians expect us to do everything that we can to protect their freedoms, and then to work where we can, with the governor and with the federal government.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in reference to some voter demographics and polarizing factors about Trump as a candidate, he said “I think we learned some lessons about what’s acceptable and unacceptable for whole lot of American people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats and activists have continually stressed concern over Trump’s rhetoric that often disparages people of color, immigrants and women. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the country made a bet on Donald Trump that some of the things that he has said he didn’t mean, and they’re going to trust him,” Scott said. “I hope they’re right, because we want him to be successful, because it’s good for the entire country.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The economy was “a huge issue” during the 2024 election cycle, Scott added as a reason some Virginia voters turned to Trump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think inflation is real. There are people who still feel some pain around inflation. Even though inflation is down, prices are down, we’re back moving in the right direction… I think that that message didn’t resonate with voters, and I think that ended up hurting us at some point,” he said. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., whose seat was not up for reelection this year, said that he was committed to “working with President-elect Trump to get things done for Virginians, just as I did during his first term.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Americans made their choice on Tuesday, and while it wasn’t my favored candidate, I respect the democratic process and the outcome of this election,” Warner said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many Democratic leaders had anticipated a strong showing for Harris in the state, but her smaller-than-expected margin of victory reflects a shift in Virginia’s political landscape, particularly in rural areas that saw increased GOP turnout, political analysts say. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia and nationally, red areas became more red and blue areas became less blue nearly everywhere,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s obvious liabilities — his felony convictions, his chaotic administration and rhetoric driven by his white-hot anger — didn’t seem to matter to voters who were in a mood to reject the status quo, Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the commonwealth, where abortion was protected by existing state law, the abortion issue was less relevant. In a number of states where abortion was on the ballot, abortion measures were far more popular than the Democratic candidates who supported them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And voters were clearly unhappy with the Biden administration&#8217;s record, particularly as it related to economic anxiety, the border and racial and cultural politics, Farnsworth added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The national dimensions of this frustration were seen in all areas — nearly everywhere we saw that Harris won by less or lost by more than Biden did four years ago.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Republicans hailed Trump’s victory as a win for the commonwealth while remaining silent on the former president’s defeat in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, said in a statement that Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, will return to Washington with “a clear mandate” from the American people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Across Virginia, and indeed the entire nation, voters shifted to the right in record numbers. Working class Americans stood up and said they&#8217;re tired of being told the economy is fine, and that they should just buy off brand peanut butter to deal with inflation,” Gilbert said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groups long “taken for granted by the left” rejected claims that their schools are fine and their children are safe in their communities, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tens of millions of Americans decided they’d had enough of being called Nazis for simply having a different political opinion. Americans will no longer ignore what they can see right in front of them, no matter how much Democrats insist that reality is wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party, said that he was pleased with the results both nationally and in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re obviously pleased with the national race, the American people have spoken and President Trump has been reelected to a second term,” Anderson said in a phone interview Wednesday. “Here in Virginia, he did not carry it, but we worked very hard and took the 10.1% lead that Biden had in 2020 and shaved it down to just under 6% this year. I feel very good about that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of the “swings of the party pendulums” happen in a revolutionary way, Anderson added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s usually evolutionary, and we’re now in the process of trying to take that pendulum and swing it as far and as fast as possible back toward the right.” </span></p>

(Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most Republicans, however, limited their post-election commentary to social media, offering a mix of reflection and Monday-morning quarterbacking with a hint of ridicule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It looks like over 300 electoral votes, the popular vote, taking the Senate and keeping the House, and gosh, who could have predicted that calling over half of the country a bunch of bigoted misogynists if they didn’t vote for your candidate wasn’t a good campaign strategy? Who could have predicted that?” Del. Nick Freitas, R-Culpeper, a social media influencer, told his 1.3 million Instagram followers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCCJJQ7uY4z/?igsh=MWN3MnV3MjQyZWFkbw==" target="_blank">in a video</a> he posted Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, state Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, asked for suggestions for “some of the action items for Virginia as we move forward” from the 2024 election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Identify the 200k Virginia Biden voters who didn’t show up for Harris. Figure out what’s going on with some of the pollsters that appear to have been completely divorced from reality,” Sturtevant listed among his own action items. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susan Swecker, the chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, declined to comment Wednesday, stating that she was waiting for Harris to address the American people later on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But DPVA spokeswoman Kelsey Carolan said that Virginia Democrats fared well in the presidential election compared to other eastern states — despite Republican gains across the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carolan cited election data from Connecticut, where Trump gained 8.9% of voters compared to 2020, New York (10.6%), New Jersey (10.9%) and Maryland (10.3%).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia, Trump currently has a gain of 4.8%” Carolan said. “That is the most apples-to-apples analysis, because all of these states are states where neither campaign spent money on TV ads. This was a wave election and we’ve held our own.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few Democratic lawmakers  took their post-election sorrows to social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://x.com/jackie4norfolk/status/1854158831162454269" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lengthy thread</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on X, Del. Jackie Glass, D-Norfolk, said that Tuesday evening reminded her of the night when Trump was first elected eight years ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">She recalled how her then 10-year-old son asked her if his Latino and Hispanic classmates in school might be &#8220;taken away.&#8221; She added that she had once again woken up with a &#8220;familiar sense of dread.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Glass still left her fellow Democrats with a message of hope and optimism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Grab your pen, your pocketbook, your protest sign, your petition, and above all, your purpose. Remember, we are Lovers — no matter who we love, where we’ve been, or how we’ve lived. And if there’s one thing I know as a woman and a mother, it’s this: Lovers make the best fighters. Let’s fight for Virginia. Let’s go.”</span></p>

Tim Kaine, D-Va., defeated Republican Hung Cao on Nov. 5, winning a third term. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., on Tuesday secured a decisive victory over his Republican challenger Hung Cao that earned him a third term on Capitol Hill. Kaine defeated Cao, a retired U.S. Navy captain, with 53-47% of the votes, according to unofficial numbers from the Virginia Department of Elections. The Associated Press called the race at roughly 11:20 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his re-election campaign, Kaine consistently championed the policies of President Joe Biden, aligning himself with key legislative achievements that he argued were vital for Virginia’s growth and prosperity, including the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, a $1.2 trillion package that has been heralded as a major win for modernizing America’s transportation and infrastructure systems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine also is an avid supporter of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which he has repeatedly hailed as a crucial step toward addressing economic and environmental concerns. The act aims to reduce the deficit, tackle rising inflation and lower healthcare costs, while also making historic investments in clean energy and climate change mitigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the year, Kaine emphasized how these measures would benefit Virginians, from creating jobs in infrastructure to supporting the state’s transition to renewable energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think ‘make, build, grow’ is the right message. We make it here, we build it here, we grow it here,” Kaine told The Mercury in a recent interview. “That takes advantage of the bills that we passed, but it also is a reflection of the fact that manufacturing jobs are up, we are doing infrastructure in a major way, so why not lean into what is actually happening on the ground?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-election polls had consistently shown Kaine, a Harvard-educated lawyer, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leading</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by double-digit points, reflecting his enduring popularity in the commonwealth, where he previously served as governor, lieutenant governor and Richmond’s mayor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao, who won his party’s nomination during a five-way primary election on June 18, ran a spirited campaign that focused on conservative values like curbing government spending and bolstering national defense. Cao also supported former President Donald Trump’s sweeping proposal to deport all undocumented immigrants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While his background as a Vietnamese immigrant and military veteran brought a unique perspective to the race, despite Trump’s endorsement Cao struggled to overcome Kaine’s strong name recognition and deep ties to Virginia’s electorate — and, at times, his own rhetorical fumbles on the stump. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao’s campaign marked the Republican’s second attempt at running for public office. In 2022, he unsuccessfully challenged U.S. Rep. Jennifer Wexton, D-Loudoun County, in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District, losing by 53-47%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before seizing the Republican nomination for one of Virginia’s two seats in the U.S. Senate, Cao often found himself stumbling over his own remarks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a conservative podcast in May, Cao pushed back against allegations in a story published by the Staunton News Leader that the political action committee he had launched to support Republican candidates in 2023 mostly benefited his own Senate bid, </span><a href="https://www.newsleader.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/22/cao-says-he-didnt-promise-super-pac-money-to-virginia-2023-candidates/73792102007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">calling the allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “a hit job” and referring to the News Leader as a “podunk local newspaper.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cao also suggested that it was “ridonkulous” to drive from his home in Purcellville to Abingdon for a campaign forum, and also appeared to grapple with Virginia geography </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/07/19/senate-candidate-cao-says-that-anything-south-of-loudon-and-fairfax-is-southern-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">when he told</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brian Kilmeade of Fox News in July that “anything south of Loudoun and Fairfax is Southern Virginia.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And at their sole </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/kaine-faces-off-against-gop-challenger-cao-in-high-stakes-u-s-senate-race/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">candidates debate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Norfolk State University, Cao’s attempts at articulating his policy platform were overshadowed by his remarks suggesting that the Navy uses drag queens as recruitment tools and his stereotyping of Asians as being good with math. </span></p>

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Pulled fire alarm at Arlington, Va. precinct didn’t disrupt voting, Beals says</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following issues with some ballots in Richmond and Chesterfield earlier in the day, in a 9 p.m. update Tuesday evening Virginia’s top election officials reported just one other hiccup: a pulled fire alarm that prompted the evacuation of an Arlington County polling location, but didn’t prevent anyone from voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 6 p.m. hour, the alarm was pulled at  Arlington Precinct 150, the Crystal Plaza polling place,  Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals told reporters in the third and final press briefing of the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They evacuated the building and they continued voting outside,” Beals said. “Their voters continued voting through 7 o’clock, and then they closed the polls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some colleges and universities, Beals said, faced longer lines, but “we have checked with all of those registrars, and they have indicated to us that all of those students have been served. There currently are no lines, (or) anyone else waiting to be served in those areas.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia did not receive any bomb threats, Beals said, following a news </span><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-statement-on-bomb-threats-to-polling-locations" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Federal Bureau of Investigation stating several states had received them. The origins of those threats were traced back to Russian email domains, the release said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As results continued to trickle in Tuesday evening, Beals also laid out the next steps in the counting process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wednesday morning, officials will double check the results from machines and begin reviewing provisional ballots from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same day registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which were counted at 15,000 to 17,000, as of Tuesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After provisional ballots are cast, identification of the voters must be validated by 10 a.m. on Friday. Local electoral boards will be meeting next week to finalize whether all their provisional ballots will be counted or not, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities have until Friday, Nov. 15 to report their results to the state Board of Election, which will then determine on Monday, Nov. 18 which congressional race will receive an audit, a procedure to make sure votes were counted accurately. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re going to have two post election auditions during the week of Nov. 18,” said Beals. “One, the U.S. Senate race will receive a risk-limiting audit that every locality across the state is going to participate in. And then two, one congressional district is going to be chosen at random to also have a risk-limiting audit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dec. 17 is when Virginia will convene its electoral college, when electors will meet and vote for the president and vice president, Beals continued. Their certificates will be sent to Congress and  counted on Jan. 6, and the president will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals also expressed gratitude to poll workers statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would like to reiterate my thanks to the hundreds of poll workers across Virginia who helped their fellow Virginians vote today,” Beals said. “We could not have done it without you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the backdrop of a contentious presidential election, voting appeared to go smoothly in Virginia on Tuesday as people cast their ballots in federal and local elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though early voting </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/early-voting-in-virginia-dips-below-2020-levels-as-parties-push-for-final-turnout-surge/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year from the last presidential cycle — which also happened at a height of the COVID-19 pandemic where people were avoiding large crowds — some jurisdictions have shared that they’ve experienced </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/live-updates-election-day-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">long lines and high turnout </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">or substantial use of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">same-day</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> voter registration this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple of snags were detected in Richmond and Chesterfield early in the day, though both were resolved quickly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Richmond, 11 people at an East End precinct had been given ballots that only included federal elections rather than both federal and local contests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately,” Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said, those voters won’t be able to weigh in on local contests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer said the city’s electoral board held an emergency meeting to vote to remove the precinct chief. A member of his staff oversaw voting for the rest of the day and no other issues have been reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal-only ballots were intended for military and overseas voters who can vote in federal elections, but can’t vote in local jurisdictions because they don’t live there and aren’t part of the local tax base, Balmer explained. These ballots are typically used for absentee voting, but Balmer said that a small number are still on hand at local polling places because that voter demographic does sometimes show up to vote in person. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was those ballots that were mistakenly handed to people when Precinct 310 opened at 6 a.m. Balmer said that because those people have already voted, there’s nothing that can be done to change that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once we put their ballot in the machine — even though it’s clear as day that they were given the wrong ballot — there’s no do-overs unfortunately,” Balmer said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Chesterfield County briefly experienced jammed ballot scanners at “a handful of precincts,” registrar Missy Vera said in a release. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scanners are used to accept printed ballots and she attributed the issue to “ink levels </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of a specific batch of ballots that were printed by a state-affiliated vendor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To resolve the matter, poll workers were instructed to not use the specific batch of blank ballots that had been identified as the source of the issue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that the jamming issues “are not slowing the voting process” and that the unused ballots that had been the source of the jamming issue wouldn’t  be used going forward.</span></p>
<p><b>5:25 p.m.:</b></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Richmond precinct chief dismissed after handing out the wrong ballots</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A precinct chief in Richmond’s Precinct 310 was dismissed and replaced on Tuesday after an error resulted in 11 voters receiving the wrong ballots, according to Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals informed reporters during a second Election Day briefing Tuesday afternoon that Richmond’s City Electoral Board met and chose to replace the precinct chief responsible. The error meant that the affected voters were unable to cast ballots for local races, as they were given special ballots meant exclusively for federal races.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My understanding is that they cast only federal ballots which included only the office of President of the United States,” Beals explained, adding that these specific ballots are usually reserved for voters who are about to move. “Those ballots, to my understanding, did not include the local races,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The error highlights the challenges election officials face in ensuring each voter receives the correct ballot, especially during high-turnout elections. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Number of provisional ballots cast unclear, but same-day registrations are up</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals also said at the briefing Tuesday that the number of provisional ballots cast throughout Election Day remained unclear by 4 p.m. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right now we don’t have anything statewide other than what we knew of this morning, which is we had between 15,000 and 17,000 statewide,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added that several localities with universities and colleges reported an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">uptick in same-day voter registrations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have heard that there are long lines in some localities that have universities and colleges, as a lot of those students have been encouraged to same-day register today,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Elections officials have remained in touch with these localities and, when needed, deployed more officers of elections and supplies to those universities and the precincts on their campuses, Beals said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What we encourage everyone to do is to please make sure you stay in line, even if the 7 p.m. hour passes. They will process you and they do want you to vote, so please do not get out of line.”</span></p>
<p><strong>5:10 p.m.:</strong></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">At the polls, Northern Virginia voters weigh views on abortion, cost of living</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, campaign signs were spread across Northern Virginia at intersections, street corners, and even posted on a bridge over Interstate 66, urging Virginians to support local, state and presidential candidates in this year’s general election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In areas such as Arlington, Falls Church, and Fairfax City, some voters have already cast their ballots early, leaving little foot traffic at precincts on Election Day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to David Bjerke, general registrar for the City of Falls Church, the city recorded a voter turnout of 80.1% by 5 p.m. In Fairfax County, one of the larger jurisdictions in the commonwealth, election officials said total turnout was at 67.9% as of 3:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting as of Tuesday morning, the number of early voting ballots cast has dipped by about 525,000 compared to the last 2020 presidential election, according to data collected by the Virginia Public Access Project (VPAP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some Election Day voters in close proximity to the federal government offices in Washington D.C., said they preferred to keep their names and who they voted for private due to their jobs, others were not shy to share their views.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we need a change in this country,” said Elizabeth Green, a city of Fairfax voter who is concerned about the cost of living and voted early for former President Donald Trump. Green said she thinks Trump is the best presidential candidate to tackle the rising costs of food and housing she’s seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other residents in Northern Virginia said they voted in person for convenience and to experience the voting atmosphere firsthand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mealod Khashei, in the city of Falls Church, said he voted on Election Day because doing so gives him more confidence his vote will be counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s our civic duty, right,” Khashei said. “We [have] a few responsibilities that we’ve got to do, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing.”</span></p>
<p><strong>4:07 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re getting slammed with provisional ballots,” city of Richmond registrar Keith Balmer said in a phone call around 3:30 p.m. It’s mostly same-day voter registration.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Davis, an election poll worker at Main Street Station polling place, estimated Tuesday afternoon that about 10% of ballots cast by early afternoon were provisional ballots — in part, he surmised,</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">from populations of college students</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that live and study in the area. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same-day registration and provisional ballots are used in instances where someone forgot to bring their ID card or another form of identification when they vote. They can register at the polling place, vote, and then follow up with their local election officials to provide identification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also an</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/think-you-might-have-been-mistakenly-purged-from-virginias-voter-rolls-heres-what-to-do/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">option</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the roughly 1,600 people who were</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">purged from voter rolls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this year over questions of citizenship status on Department of Motor Vehicles paperwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike regular ballots, provisional ballots undergo more scrutiny before they are counted, Balmer said. Officials research voters to determine factors like their identity, citizenship status, or residency in the district they voted in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My staff is going to have to research the eligibility of all of these voters and make a determination if their ballot should count or if it should not,” he explained. “Then the electoral board will ultimately make the final decision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically, all of next week, we&#8217;re going to be adjudicating hundreds, if not thousands, of provisional ballots,” Balmer said. </span></p>
<p><strong>3:48 p.m.:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside the Virginia Commonwealth University polling location on the second floor of the Student Commons, several students shared their same-day voter registration experiences and the top policy issues driving their choice between presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Reproductive rights, housing and economic policy were among the young voters’ chief concerns. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/05/va-college-voting-bloc-utilizes-same-day-registration-shares-top-policy-issues/">Read more.</a></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>2:15 p.m.: </strong></p>
<p>Chris Davis, a poll worker at Main Street Station, said that about 10% of votes cast had been through same-day registration. He suspects that’s due to the amount of Virginia Commonwealth University and other university and college students that live in the area.</p>
<p><b>1 p.m.:</b></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Virginia early voter turnout data and mail-in voting</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals said at a media briefing on Election Day morning that as of Nov. 1, a record 6,374,437 Virginians had registered to vote. As of Tuesday morning, 2,305,439 Virginians had already cast their ballots through early voting, of which 1,861,938 were cast in person and 443,501 were returned by mail. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the mail ballots that are still outstanding, a total of 126,266 mail ballots have yet to be returned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those who are voting absentee by mail must have those ballots postmarked on or before today Nov. 5, and they must be received in the mail by noon Friday, Nov. 8, in order to be counted,” Beals said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While same-day registrations data was not yet available for Tuesday around 10 a.m., Beals said that the state had filed a total of 16,557 same-day registrations leading up to Election day, “but we are obviously expecting more today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, Beals had </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/05/virginias-top-elections-official-warns-of-possible-delays-in-mail-in-voting-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed concerns</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about potential delays with the U.S. Postal Service affecting timely processing of mail-in ballots ahead of the election. However, on Tuesday she reported that these issues have not materialized so far, and ballots are being processed on schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a lot of folks have chosen to do a drop off at a dropbox at their registrar’s office, we have seen an increase in that method of return,” Beals told reporters. ” We have not heard specific examples of people having delays in getting their mail back.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added most voters are being very diligent about ensuring that their ballot has been received, which they can check online and see that it’s been received by their local registrar’s staff once they mail it back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have seen an overall decrease in the number of people who have requested absentee by mail-in ballot this year as compared to 2020, but you can&#8217;t necessarily attribute that to just this issue, because 2020 was a very different time and a lot of people requested mail-in ballots because they just didn’t know what to expect on Election Day that year with the pandemic. So it’s hard to even make a case there.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election integrity and and security concerns addressed early</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals reiterated that elections in Virginia are secure and reliable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia, we have some of the most experienced election officials in the country. They have already conducted two statewide elections this year and have provided 138 days of early election day voting for Virginia voters as of today,” she said. Because Virginia has elections each year, Beals said, “our election officials have a great depth of experience in handling issues that come up for voters at the polls.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals added that election officials in the commonwealth have worked throughout the year to ensure that the elections are safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In terms of security concerns, we have been meeting for many months with our state and federal law enforcement partners to plan for today,” she said. “We’ve had several meetings where we’ve run through various scenarios to make plans.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals couldn’t speak to the specifics of those plans but asserted again  “we’re very confident that we’re going to have a safe and secure election in Virginia day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Justice officials are </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/u-s-justice-department-to-monitor-polling-places-in-27-states-including-six-virginia-localities/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">monitoring six localities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia Tuesday to ensure compliance with federal voting laws, but Beals said that her department would have no information to share on that. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Election Day snags</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals reported that the Department of Elections had been made aware of an incident at Precinct 310 in Richmond Tuesday morning, where election workers handed out federal-only ballots to at least 11 voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That issue has still since been resolved. My understanding is that the officers of election gave out the incorrect ballot to the voters that had only a presidential race on the ballot,” she said. </span></p>

(Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Elections Commissioner Susan Beals confirmed Tuesday that no voters have been removed from the state’s voter rolls under Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since Oct. 15 — the deadline for Virginians to register to vote online or apply for absentee ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the figure that has been out there is the figure that stands, there has not been any additional work done on that,” Beals said at an Election Day news conference at Richmond’s Capitol Square, referring to 1,600 individuals purged under Youngkin’s directive since August. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The last time that records were sent to registrars was October 14th, which is the close of books, and … that’s normally when we close out our maintenance practices,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pause in removals comes amid a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">high-profile legal battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the state’s efforts to manage its voter rolls. The U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/u-s-supreme-court-grants-stay-in-challenge-to-youngkins-voter-purge-order-allowing-removal-of-thousands-from-rolls/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted a stay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week on a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/22/youngkin-blasts-doj-lawsuit-that-trust-virginias-voter-roll-removals-into-national-spotlight/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower court’s ruling </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would have required the commonwealth to restore the voting rights of the 1,600 removed Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares had already acknowledged the end of a voter purge in a court filing from Oct. 22,  without providing a date for the cut-off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The defendants have already ceased their allegedly unlawful removal process, as they always planned to do, which means there is no ongoing alleged violation,” the filing said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the Youngkin administration has not said publicly that they were no longer removing individuals from the rolls — even after last week’s Supreme Court ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s order had instructed the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to send records of people thought to be non-citizens to local election registrars for potential removal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the order’s timeline became a point of contention, with critics arguing it led to eligible voters being mistakenly removed too close to Election Day, a  violation of the so-called 90-day quiet period before an election, which is mandated by the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act of 1993</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals on Tuesday pushed back against allegations that Youngkin’s order prevented some citizens from exercising their right to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, in Virginia, we want every eligible voter to vote in this election,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals underscored that the removal process has been in place since 2006, when the law was signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It has been managed and processed the exact same way by every administration since 2006 when the law was enacted. Nothing has changed in the way that that process is managed by the department,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Beals, the DMV sends information to the Department of Elections, where it is checked against the department’s list of registered voters. For any voters who marked on their DMV paperwork that they are not U.S. citizens, their information is forwarded to local registrars, who then send notifications by mail to these individuals, informing them they may be at risk of removal from the voter rolls, unless they provide proof of citizenship within 14 days. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If they return the form, nothing happens to the voter, (but) if they fail to return the form after 14 days, they are sent an additional notice where they are advised that they are being canceled because of non-citizenships status,” Beals said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anyone who is canceled for non-citizenship status and feels as though it is in error can go to their polling location today on election day and same-day-register to vote and cast a ballot in this election.” </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump’s decision to hold a last-minute rally in Salem, Virginia, on Saturday, just days before the Nov. 5 election, has raised eyebrows, as most polls show Vice President Kamala Harris — who has not campaigned in the commonwealth since becoming the Democratic nominee last summer — with a comfortable lead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event will mark a nostalgic moment for Rich Anderson, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, who attended a gathering with President Richard Nixon at the same venue over half a century ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A little tidbit for you,” Anderson shared in a phone interview Thursday, “when I was a little kid, and I remember it like yesterday, I went to the rally in 1969 where President Nixon came to the same Civic Center and campaigned for (former Virginia Gov.) Linwood Holton, who was elected governor that year.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nixon’s visit 55 years ago, Anderson said, reverberated through the Roanoke Valley at the time, and he — and other high profile Republicans — hope that Trump’s event will have a similar effect. </span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Polls vs. perception</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/26/harris-trump-virginia-voters-poll/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post-Shar survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Saturday — one of the most recent presidential polls available for Virginia — Harris holds a six-point edge over Trump, similar to her eight-point advantage in a previous poll from September.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/news/rc_poll_politics_election_2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> released Friday by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College shows Harris with a 10-point lead over former President Donald Trump (51%-41%). Independent Cornel West and Libertarian Chase Oliver both poll at 2%, and Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, takes 1% of the vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/harris-kaine-ahead-in-virginia-by-comfortable-margins-new-poll-says/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Oct. 7 by the Wason Center for Civic Leadership at Christopher Newport University had the Vice President up by 11 points (52-41%) among likely Virginia voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Republicans insist that a victory remains within reach in the commonwealth, where no GOP candidate has won a presidential race since George W. Bush in 2004 and where Trump lost in both 2016 and 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia, I believe, is in play,” said Anderson. “While the polling generally has Harris up, a lot of it is within the margin of error.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I’ve told people is, don’t get fixated on these polls, regardless (of) where they are. If it shows Trump in a comfortable position, then the danger is that people start relaxing on our side. And if it&#8217;s not good news for us, then people get demoralized,” Anderson said. “Just work like we’re 10 points down and that’s the surest path to victory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Ryer, a spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia, cited a Republican-leaning poll from Monday, which has Harris at 48% and Trump at 46% and is within the margin of error. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether you’re looking at polling showing a margin-of-error race or Republicans’ strong showing in early voting, it’s clear that Virginia is a battleground,” Ryer said. “President Trump is holding a rally in Virginia because Virginia is in play.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Democrats have pushed back against the notion that the presidential race in Virginia has become more competitive in recent weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Donald Trump has been soundly defeated every time he’s run in Virginia, and while he’s welcome to waste his time campaigning here, Virginians are going to once again reject his extreme plans to roll back our rights and freedoms, wreck our economy, and raise taxes by nearly $4,000 for hardworking families,” said Aaron Fritschner, a spokesman for the Harris campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Susan Swecker, the chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, in a text message suggested that Trump’s choice to visit the commonwealth this close before the election might reflect his campaign’s dwindling options for large rallies, especially in competitive states where his standing is uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The planned Salem rally, Swecker said, was “another tired Trump gimmick to counter that his show has grown stale in the core battlegrounds, as his crowd sizes have plummeted and exhausted people walk out of his rallies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump is looking for “fresh crowds” in New Mexico and Virginia to “rant and rave about conspiracies like Youngkin’s false conspiracy theories about voting,” Swecker added. “Trump has done the same last-minute stunts in places like New Mexico in 2016 and Minnesota in 2020, only to get crushed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Trump has never shied away from campaigning in Democratic-leaning areas — as his recent visits to Monterey, California, and New York City have demonstrated — political analysts are also skeptical, noting that Trump lost Virginia in two previous elections and that the state has become more solidly Democratic in recent years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some suggest Trump’s visit could be an attempt to create the appearance of momentum in the commonwealth, while others speculate it might serve as a rallying cry for his base in case he contests the results after a potential defeat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As recently as last week Trump said on the Joe Rogan Show that he </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/25/us/politics/trump-joe-rogan-podcast.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">doesn’t trust the polls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but I cannot imagine his campaign thinks that Virginia is in play, especially since the most recent polls I have seen show Harris with a small, but outside-the-margin lead in the commonwealth,” said John Aughenbaugh, an associate political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have to wonder if there are other reasons why he would spend valuable campaign time in Salem, when he could be visiting the truly competitive battleground states Pennsylvania, Wisconsin or Michigan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Aughenbaugh said, in 2016 most experts stated that Trump did not have a chance in either Pennsylvania or Wisconsin, yet he ended up winning there in part because his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton stopped campaigning in those states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aughenbaugh added that the Trump campaign also may be seizing on the heightened tensions over Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s recent executive order, which led to the removal of thousands of Virginians from the voter rolls and sparked legal challenges and national scrutiny. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The controversy culminated Wednesday, when the U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/103024zr_f2ah.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">granted a temporary stay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the ongoing legal dispute over the governor’s order — a ruling in the Republicans’ favor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Political forecaster Larry Sabato, the director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that with Trump’s rally in Salem — a Republican stronghold — the former president might not have a rational purpose and that he was simply playing to his base by projecting strength through crowd size. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Trump is in part a creation of TV and ‘The Apprentice,’” Sabato said, referring to NBC’s reality television series which Trump hosted for 14 seasons. “He knows that actual reality can be shaped by the projection of his preferred version of reality. His version right now is, ‘We’re going to win in a landslide and that includes Virginia.’ His MAGA troops will certainly buy it, and it will whip them up even more than they already are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Salem is a four-hour drive from Washington, D.C., it is close enough to the networks so that coverage will be extensive on the final weekend, Sabato said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rural areas are Trump’s greatest strength, far more than urban-suburban territory. But Virginia is not competitive. If it was, we’d be flooded with TV ads and boasts from the campaigns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Anderson, the RPV chair, said he suspected that the Trump campaign may be trying to win Virginia by replicating Youngkin’s strategy during the 2021 gubernatorial election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“President Trump has not been to Southwest Virginia, which is obviously a major Republican enclave that must be turned out in order to offset the blue areas of the state, principally the urban crescent that runs from Fairfax all the way down to Richmond and then turns east toward Norfolk,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Youngkin successfully aimed at losing Northern Virginia by fewer voters than some Republicans before him while focusing on increasing GOP turnout in Southwest Virginia, Southside and other Republican areas, Anderson said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Youngkin — who during his gubernatorial bid managed to flip the commonwealth red by skillfully balancing his stance on a former president who remained highly unpopular with a significant portion of Virginia voters — has now become one of Trump’s biggest cheerleaders, willing to reiterate the campaign’s message that the state is in play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia is far more competitive than any of the pundits would believe,” Youngkin told Fox News’s Bret Baier on Wednesday, vowing to attend the Salem rally. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin’s executive order that resulted in the removal of over 6,000 Virginians from the state’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stay pauses a lower court’s ruling that would have required the state to restore 1,600 voters to the rolls, allowing Youngkin’s directive to remain in effect and voter removals to continue as the case proceeds. The high court’s decision drew praise from Youngkin and laments from the voter rights groups suing him and the state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court’s six conservative justices supported the stay, with the three liberals dissenting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin in a statement hailed the court’s decision as “a victory for commonsense and election fairness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am grateful for the work of Attorney General Jason Miyares on this critical fight to protect the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. Clean voter rolls are one important part of a comprehensive approach we are taking to ensure the fairness of our elections,” Youngkin said, adding that the ruling would ensure a secure election on Nov. 5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginians can cast their ballots on Election Day knowing that Virginia’s elections are fair, secure, and free from politically-motivated interference,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The order comes after the Virginia Republican Party filed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/29/virginia-gop-calls-on-u-s-supreme-court-to-reinstate-youngkins-voter-purge-order/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tuesday supporting Youngkin’s efforts, arguing that removing noncitizens from the voter rolls should not be delayed due to the federally mandated “quiet period” — a buffer period around elections meant to avoid disruptions to voter records. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Republican brief argues that the governor’s order was based on data from the Department of Motor Vehicles and focused on noncitizens, and thus does not constitute a “systematic” voter purge restricted by the quiet period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opposition to the order has come from various groups, including former GOP lawmakers such as Barbara Comstock, Denver Riggleman, and Adam Kinzinger, who filed </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330589/20241029151116178_333985%20Amicus%20on%20Application.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a separate brief </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">urging the Supreme Court to deny the stay. They argue that hastily removing voters could lead to eligible citizens losing their rights, citing concerns over the potential exclusion of legitimate voters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares and Youngkin’s administration maintain that the executive order is a necessary step for election security. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement released Wednesday, Miyares called the Supreme Court ruling a win for election integrity and the rule of law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While I am gratified the court moved so quickly, I remain deeply concerned and alarmed that the Biden-Harris administration chose to execute this maneuver just 25 days before an election,” he said of </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed earlier this month by the Justice Department that challenges Youngkin’s executive order. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics, however — including the Virginia Center for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters’s Virginia chapter, who are suing Youngkin and the state — argue that the purge risks disenfranchising Virginians and disproportionately impacts minority voters, calling the move part of a larger trend of restrictive voting policies. Representatives of the groups and their lawyers said they were “disappointed” with the Supreme Court’s decision in a virtual press conference held Wednesday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Snow, counsel with the Lawyers Committee For Civil Rights Under Law, called the decision by the nation’s highest court an “abuse of power.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bert Bayou with African Communities Together said that the state’s and high court’s actions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are &#8220;sending a disturbing message that (immigrant’s) voices are not valued, not wanted, and not American.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are living in a political climate that is fanning the flames of xenophobia,” he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orion Danjuma, counsel with Protect Democracy, noted how a similar situation was also recently settled in Alabama. A federal judge </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/10/16/federal-judge-blocks-alabama-secretary-of-states-voter-removal-plan/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blocked </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alabama’s voter roll purge program after the Department of Justice had filed a similar suit last month as it did to Virginia. When Virginia requested its stay to the U.S. Supreme Court, Alabama’s Attorney General </span><a href="https://www.alabamaag.gov/alabama-joins-25-state-coalition-urging-u-s-supreme-court-to-grant-emergency-motion-so-virginia-is-not-forced-to-add-noncitizens-to-its-voter-rolls/#:~:text=(Montgomery%2C%20Ala)%20%E2%80%93%20Alabama,rolls%20for%20the%20upcoming%20election." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed onto an amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in support of the request. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danjuma stressed that the programs “disenfranchise eligible voters” and that organizations like his will continue to challenge them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While this is a serious setback to voters for this election, we want to make clear that we will be continuing to expose problems with the state&#8217;s program so that they can be corrected in the future,” he said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">State lawmakers react</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s statehouse leaders shared a variety of responses to the news on Wednesday, reflecting both support for SCOTUS’ decision and dismay due to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who has been outspoken in his opposition to Youngkin’s executive order, posted to X that the stay SCOTUS granted “does not equal a win.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Unfortunately, The Governor&#8217;s scheme to block legal eligible (Virginia) voters has temporarily worked. It&#8217;s a sad day for the Commonwealth and the country,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, state Sen. John McGuire, a member of the body’s Privileges and Elections subcommittee and a candidate for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District seat, commended the Youngkin administration for &#8220;leading the charge to keep our elections secure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “This is simple: noncitizens shouldn’t be able to vote, and I’m glad the Supreme Court agrees,&#8221; McGuire stated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As chair of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee, Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach had written a letter to Commissioner of Elections Susan Beals on Sep. 27, seeking more information on how the removals were handled under Youngkin’s Aug. 7 executive order and whether non-citizens were facing prosecution for attempting to register.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his letter Rouse referenced a Fox News </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6360067628112" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Youngkin did the day of his executive order where he claimed that his order would lead to “immediate” removal of people and subsequent prosecution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rouse asked Beals if registrars were referring people to commonwealth&#8217;s attorneys. In her Oct. 8 response to Rouse, Beals did not answer whether registrars had referred non-citizens to local prosecutors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plaintiffs in the case against the state argue there has been no evidence of people being prosecuted for attempting to vote illegally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have tried to get straight answers from this Administration,” Rouse said Wednesday. “It took the U.S. Department of Justice filing suit and a federal judge forcing the Youngkin administration to disclose the names of those removed and confirm what we feared: that in fact eligible Virginia voters have been stripped from the rolls.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that he and members of his committee will “work to ensure that these disenfranchised voters are educated as to the procedures for casting a valid provisional ballot.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the situation could mean for Virginia voters, on Election Day and beyond</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the stay in place, the case is likely to continue drawing national attention as the election nears, spotlighting debates over voting rights, citizenship and electoral integrity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It could also lead to confusion at the polls next Tuesday, because it remains unclear what information voters who have been purged would need to show for same-day registration, said Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The administration is claiming that there is sufficient evidence to knock someone off the rolls. If that’s true, and if a registrar has said this person shouldn’t be on the roll, I’m not sure what kind of information would convince the registrar that the person should be on the rolls and should have their provisional ballot counted. And that’s a tricky issue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers added that it also remains unclear what the Supreme Court ruling means for the federal </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters of Virginia earlier this month which alleges that the process used to purge the rolls violates the 90-day quiet period and therefore disenfranchises eligible voters while raising concerns over transparency and accuracy in the state’s voter registration system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In theory, the case goes back to the drawing board and you need to run it as a sort of a regular merits case as opposed to just an injunction case. But the problem with that is that the point of the case is that the 90-day quiet period is going to be over once election day is done,” Chambers said. “Then the question becomes, is the purge program in and of itself unlawful in general?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some state lawmakers have signaled they are ready to tackle that question, and </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/should-legislators-tweak-virginias-2006-voter-roll-law-for-more-clarity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that undergirds it.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="3YaBAvmhuV"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/should-legislators-tweak-virginias-2006-voter-roll-law-for-more-clarity/">Should legislators tweak Virginia’s 2006 voter roll law for more clarity?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Travis Hackworth, R-Tazewell County, said in a phone interview Wednesday that in the 2025 legislative session, he would “be open to looking at anything” in the 2006 law that would limit potential confusion at the polls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bottom line is, if you are a U.S. citizen, we want you to vote, it’s your right and duty to vote,” said Hackworth, a member of the Senate Privileges &amp; Election who was “very disheartened” when the lower court ruled to halt Youngkin’s order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If any among the affected 1,600 Virginians believe they have been removed from the voter rolls in error, Hackworth urged them to still cast a provisional ballot bringing documentation proving their citizenship status and let the local electoral board “figure that out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that maybe we are kind of overcomplicating this process, because anybody still has the right on the day of to say, ‘I have been purged from the voter rolls, I am a citizen of the United States, and I want to vote.’ If you have that much conviction to go to the polls and vote provisional, you will bring something that’s going to back up your claim that you are a citizen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330552/20241029131746854_24A407%20Beals_SCOTUS_Amicus_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">its filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the state GOP argues that the removal of illegally registered non-citizens from Virginia’s voter rolls should not be restricted by the “quiet period,” a federally mandated time frame close to an election during which systematic changes to the voter rolls are limited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in a </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A407/330589/20241029151116178_333985%20Amicus%20on%20Application.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separate amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also filed on Tuesday, a group of prominent Republicans who formerly served in Congress and are outspoken critics of the GOP’s presidential nominee Donald Trump – including Denver Riggleman, Barbara Comstock and Adam Kinzinger — are urging the Supreme Court to deny Virginia’s request for an emergency stay and uphold the lower court’s ruling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their filing, the former lawmakers argue that while the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> authorizes “truly individualized removals” of voters from the rolls at any time, the law specifically seeks to prevent sweeping purges that could disenfranchise eligible voters rather than targeted removals of ineligible individuals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To protect the right to vote from the inherent errors, vagaries, and bureaucratic swamp of last-minute systematic removals, Congress imposed the quiet period provision to protect voters in the immediate run-up to elections — at which point it might be impossible or impractical to correct a wrongfully terminated registration status,” the brief said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “daily systematic removal program” recently undertaken by Virginia is precisely what the NVRA’s quiet period provision forbids, the filing continues.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is not a close case; it is instead a paradigmatic violation of Congress’s design. The fact that this last-minute systematic program has in fact disenfranchised eligible Virginia voters only confirms the wisdom of the NVRA’s plan and the illegality of this scheme. To hold otherwise would thwart the bipartisan congressional consensus underlying the NVRA.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Republicans argue in their own filing from Tuesday that even if the NVRA applies to efforts to remove illegally registered noncitizens from the voter rolls, Virginia’s process is “sufficiently individualized” and that it does not constitute the kind of “systematic” effort to remove individuals from the voter rolls prohibited during the “quiet period.”</span></p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Over 1,600 people removed from voter rolls under Youngkin order; groups seek court injunction&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/over-1600-people-removed-from-voter-rolls-under-youngkin-order-groups-seek-court-injunction/embed/#?secret=5TifZ8PSwI#?secret=PaMid6TgIU" data-secret="PaMid6TgIU" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP filing claims that the Virginia Department of Elections’ practice of comparing voter rolls with data from the Department of Motor Vehicles to identify non-citizens is selective enough to sidestep the restrictions imposed by the quiet period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Courts have correctly interpreted ‘systematically remove’ to mean programs that make decisions about voters’ eligibility based on mass information collected by third parties rather than individualized information or investigation,” the brief said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Republicans contend that allowing the lower court’s ruling to stand would cause “irreparable harm” as the Nov. 5 election nears. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The consequence of that order is that non-citizens — who all agree cannot legally vote — will be added back on the voter rolls at the last minute, diluting legitimate votes and exposing those non-citizens to a substantial risk of criminal prosecution should they misunderstand the lower courts’ order as a greenlight for them to vote unlawfully,” the filing said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GOP also asserts that there is no risk of harm to eligible voters if the executive order remains in effect. Virginia law allows same-day registration, providing an alternative for those erroneously removed to cast a ballot on Election Day. According to the amicus brief, “no legal voters could or would be disenfranchised” if the executive order is upheld.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares filed the commonwealth’s appeal to Chief Justice John G. Roberts, seeking a stay on federal Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles’ Oct. 25 order requiring the reinstatement of individuals removed from Virginia’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giles had ruled that Youngkin’s order, issued in August, may have inadvertently included eligible voters. The order directed the Department of Motor Vehicles to send daily lists of individuals identified as noncitizens to the State Board of Elections for immediate removal from voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the 2006 state law on which Youngkin’s directive is based calls for this process to occur on a monthly basis.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks to reporters outside the Capitol near the end of the 2024 General Assembly session. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order to remove more than 6,000 Virginians from the voter rolls has come under intense national scrutiny after the Department of Justice (DOJ) </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/14/voter-purge-lawsuits-add-to-disenfranchisement-allegations-against-youngkin-administration/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> challenging its legality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just weeks until the Nov. 5 election, the suit has amplified concerns over voter disenfranchisement and the integrity of the state’s election process mirrored in other states leading up to the presidential contest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Fox News Sunday, Youngkin defended his move, arguing that it was based on a law signed in 2006 by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“To be clear, this is not a purge,” he told host Shannon Bream. “To describe this as something that’s a purge is completely inaccurate, it’s wholly consistent with the U.S. Constitution, the Virginia Constitution and Virginia law.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Monday, a federal judge in Alexandria </span><a href="https://www.wvtf.org/news/2024-10-21/federal-judge-orders-release-of-names-impacted-by-voter-rolls-purge" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ordered</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Virginia Department of Elections to disclose the names of individuals removed from the state’s voter rolls by the Youngkin administration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ruling came in response to </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an earlier lawsuit </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from the League of Women Voters and the Virginia Coalition of Immigrant Rights, which challenged Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Executive Order 35</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> signed in August, authorizing “daily” updates to Virginia’s voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These updates involved comparing the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles’ list of individuals identified as non-citizens to the list of registered voters. Local registrars were then required to notify voters whose citizenship status was challenged, informing them that their registration would be canceled unless they confirmed their citizenship within 14 days. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The governor’s response to the DOJ lawsuit</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ’s lawsuit argues that the voter removals disproportionately affected minority communities and may have wrongfully removed eligible voters without adequate notice or due process less than 90 days before a presidential election — placing Youngkin’s executive order at the center of a growing national debate about voting rights and election security. On Sunday, Youngkin sought to clarify how his administration handled the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It starts with a basic premise that when someone walks into one of our DMV’s and self-identifies as a noncitizen, and then they end up on the voter rolls, either purposely or by accident, that we go through a process individualized, not systematic, an individualized process based on that person&#8217;s self-identification as a noncitizen, to give them 14 days to affirm they are a citizen and if they don&#8217;t, they come off the voter rolls,” Youngkin told Fox News’ Shannon Bream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Youngkin also talked with CNN anchor Jake Tapper, who </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/14/politics/video/the-lead-immigration-misinformation-border-voter-registration-2024-jake-tapper" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pointed out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the issue with the executive order wasn’t the program itself but approving it within 90 days of the election — the so-called quiet period — which the DOJ suit argues is prohibited under federal law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why is it that anyone could argue that a process that removes non-citizens off of our voter rolls is anything other than common sense and constitutional?” Youngkin asked, adding that he was “frustrated” with the department’s decision to sue 25 days before the presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They could have started it a long time ago, we would have sorted this out, because I firmly believe they are wrong. But this seems far more political than otherwise, simply because of the fact that this has been going on since 2006, according to law, and they chose 25 days before an election in Virginia in order to assert something which really is inconsistent with the process that we are doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper’s interview with Youngkin further caused a stir because of their heated exchange over  </span><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4931778-donald-trump-national-guard-military-enemy-from-within/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent comments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, made about the U.S. military.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a Fox News appearance, Trump suggested deploying the National Guard or military on Election Day to prevent potential unrest, citing the threat of “the enemy from within,” which he described as “radical-left lunatics.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper asked Youngkin, “Is that something you support?” In response, the governor </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/video/glenn-youngkin-jake-tapper-interview-trump-digvid" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shifted the focus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to border issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What former President Trump is referring to are the individuals crossing the border who are committing crimes, bringing drugs, trafficking humans, and turning every state into a border state.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized that, although Virginia is not a border state, it still feels the effects of “10 million people illegally crossing the border every single day.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tapper countered that while the problems at the border are real, that’s not what Trump was referring to. “He was talking about sick people, radical-left lunatics who should be handled by the National Guard or the military.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on in that same speech, Trump said that one of “the lunatics” he addressed was U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Ca., Tapper added. “That’s who he was talking about using the National Guard and military against, radical-left lunatics, the enemy from within, people like Adam Schiff.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Youngkin said he “can’t speak” for Trump. Instead, he said he believed the CNN anchor misinterpreted the former president’s rhetoric and was “misrepresenting his thoughts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington, said that the legal fallout over Youngkin’s executive order and the subsequent debate in the national media  will likely benefit the governor’s desire to remain in the public discourse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think Governor Youngkin is available to the national media because he wants to keep Republicans thinking about Glenn Youngkin. With the one consecutive term limit, Youngkin’s political fortunes may be improved with greater national media visibility.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the courts will ultimately rule on the governor’s actions, Youngkin’s continued participation in the national discourse is a win-win, according to Farnsworth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If he wins, it boosts his popularity with Republicans, and if he loses, he can still gain favor with the GOP base. The worst thing for a Virginia governor with national ambitions is to be ignored,” Farnsworth noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a divided legislature likely to cause gridlock in the coming year and a gubernatorial election to pick Youngkin’s successor, Farnsworth added that, regardless of the presidential election outcome, there is “little downside in being combative” with the legislature.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Voter removal challenges elsewhere</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the fallout from the DOJ and League of Women Voters lawsuits continues, other states are also addressing concerns about voters being removed from rolls within the “quiet period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal court order temporarily halted the Alabama Secretary of State’s “plan to ‘inactivate’ people the office suspected of not being U.S. citizens,” the Alabama Reflector </span><a href="https://alabamareflector.com/briefs/alabama-secretary-of-states-office-posts-news-release-required-by-court-order/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Oct. 21. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another legal battle may be on the horizon in Ohio. Several voting rights groups, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, on Oct. 3 </span><a href="https://www.acluohio.org/sites/default/files/oh_nvra_notice_letter_2024.10.03.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sent a letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, raising concerns about mass voter removals in several counties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The groups argue that the removals did not comply with the requirements of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) and have warned they are prepared to take legal action if corrective measures are not implemented within 20 days.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two GOP officials from Waynesboro have filed a lawsuit challenging Virginia&#8217;s voting system ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election while threatening to not certify the results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their complaint, Curtis Lilly, the chairman of the Waynesboro Electoral Board, and Scott Mares, the board’s vice chair, are raising concerns about the validity of future results while echoing unmerited claims that the 2020 election, in which Democrat Joe Biden defeated then-President Donald Trump with more than 7 million votes, was stolen.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Filed on Oct. 4 at the Waynesboro Circuit Court against Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals and State Board of Elections Chairman John O’Bannon, the suit alleges that the voting machines used in the state are unverifiable and could potentially be manipulated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plaintiffs further claim the machines may be connected to the internet, allowing for external tampering, though this is illegal under state law and no evidence has been provided to support this allegation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When reached by phone Tuesday, Lilly declined to be interviewed for this story. Mares did not respond to several calls seeking comment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly and Mares argue that under the current legal regime, local electoral board members are unable to personally review and verify that the voting machine program being used to count the ballots “is keeping and recording a true and accurate count,” and that the device’s record tape accurately represents the ballots cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consequently, the plaintiffs believe that the voting machine is counting the votes in secret, because neither the program counting the votes recorded on the ballots nor the ballots themselves can be examined,” the complaint says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lilly further stated in an affidavit attached to the complaint that he “cannot ensure that the machines do not connect to the internet, allowing for vote counting algorithm manipulation, nor can I ensure with any certainty that the electronic ballot scanners are presenting results which are consistent with the contents of the ballot box.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Henry Chambers, a professor for constitutional law at the University of Richmond School of Law, said in a phone interview Tuesday that the lawsuit appears to be based on long debunked conspiracy theories circulating after the 2020 presidential election that claimed vote counting machines had been programmed to get votes wrong and to flip votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not really a serious thing, but some people have bought into it and it sounds like these folks have bought into it, too,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their notion is that vote counting that is done by a machine is done in secret, and therefore you have to hand-count the votes, presumably in public, in order to have a real tally of the actual vote count,” Chamber continued. “That would suggest that voting that is not done by hand and in public qualifies as counting in secret, which in theory would violate the state Constitution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, voters cast paper ballots, which are then counted by optical scanning machines — as required </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter6/section24.2-626/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">by state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to expedite the process and avoid human error. Ballot scanning machines are certified to meet both state and federal standards and are maintained under a controlled chain of custody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before every election, the scanners are tested using a predetermined sample of votes to ensure they are tallied accurately before any actual votes are cast, and it is against the law to connect a ballot scanning machine to the Internet at any point. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beals, who was appointed as Virginia’s top elections official in March 2022, did not respond to text messages seeking comment Tuesday, and a spokeswoman for the Department of the Elections said in an email that the department does not comment on pending litigation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July, Beals said that hacking the scanning machines was impossible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Period. They cannot be,” she said, adding that after the testing of the devices ahead of the election and on Election Day, officials also conduct risk-eliminating audits, which she called the back-end check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we have three different checks throughout the system just to make sure that the machines are reporting accurately.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chambers, the UR professor, called the plaintiffs’ argument that the machine counting of ballots happened in secrecy “an odd thing,” because the machine itself is doing the counting in a public space, supervised by election officials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem with counting being done in public is that one can’t necessarily explicitly see what’s going on. But the fact is, we have lots of things that count things and we just agree that it’s being counted correctly, like ATM machines,” Chambers said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one would say that the ATM machine is spitting out money in secret, but it’s spitting out money in response to a request. Here, a voting machine is counting votes in response to a ballot being fed through a machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By asking for ballots to be hand-counted instead of being tabulated by machines, the plaintiffs could really be asking for a slow-down of the count, Chambers added, which “can introduce additional problems with a valid count — and that is the whole point of feeding the ballots through during the day and having a continuous count is so that you can have results in a reasonable and fair time. Hand counting is used only when necessary when you&#8217;re talking about things like absentee ballots or ballots that can’t be read by the machine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also remains unclear why the GOP election officials who filed the suit would threaten to not certify the presidential election, in a county that leans Republican and where Trump won with 51-46% in 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, underscored that the lawsuit was a lone effort by a small group of GOP officials from one locality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As far as I know it’s only happening in this one jurisdiction out of 133, but it’s all going to get settled in the courts anyway,” Anderson said in a phone interview. “What they’re asking is the court to render its opinion, which it will do, and the opinion will likely be on the side of Virginia law, which says that ballots are counted through the optical scanners, not by hand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The counting of ballots by optical scanning machines has been proven as safe and reliable, Anderson said. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long before becoming a lawyer, state lawmaker and Virginia’s first Black House Speaker, Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, was, for years, unable to vote. After a previous felony conviction, it wasn’t until former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell restored his rights that Scott could participate in democracy again — eventually paving the way for his own run for office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Justice Department on Friday filed a lawsuit against Virginia, alleging that a state program aimed at removing people from the voter rolls, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin touted in an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-35-Comprehensive-Election-Security-Ensuring-Legal-Voters-and-Accurate-Counting---vF---8.7.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August, was implemented too close to the Nov. 5 elections and wrongfully included eligible voters. Scott said it’s another example of Youngkin’s administration restricting voting access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would not be where I am today if I had to depend on somebody like Glenn Youngkin to help me get my rights restored,” Scott said in an interview Monday. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37471" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4042/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-37471" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_4042-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth (left), with former Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell, who restored his voting rights after a felony conviction, at the state Capitol in January. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a memo in response to the suit obtained by The Mercury over the weekend, Richard Cullen, a counselor to Youngkin, wrote that Virginia’s process for removing noncitizens from the voting rolls has taken place under both Democratic and Republican governors. It also outlines how Youngkin believes he is not violating a federal policy to have purged rolls by a set time that would allow a buffer to resolve any errors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Federal law does not prohibit the removal of noncitizens from the voting rolls,” the memo said, adding that the 90-day “quiet period” under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) is “not relevant to this process since Virginia conducts an individualized — not systematic — review per Virginia law in order to correct registration records.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin on Friday called the lawsuit “unprecedented,” underscoring that his executive order simply was “appropriately enforcing a 2006 law” signed by then-Gov. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, which requires Virginia to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these common sense steps that we are legally required to take, with every resource available to us,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Virginia’s election will be secure and fair, and I will not stand idly by as this politically motivated action tries to interfere in our elections, period.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Scott commended the Justice Department for taking action (it also recently filed a similar </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/09/27/justice-department-alabama-lawsuit-voting/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit against Alabama)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The reason that we have this 90-day rule is that we don’t want citizens to be accidentally removed,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Related lawsuit stresses potential effect on naturalized citizens</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ suit also isn’t the only litigation that Youngkin faces over his Executive Order 35. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A federal </span><a href="https://www.lwv.org/newsroom/press-releases/lawsuit-challenges-recent-voter-roll-purges-virginia-preventing-eligible-us" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> filed by the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights and the League of Women Voters of Virginia earlier this month alleges that the process used to purge the rolls violates the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Voter Registration Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, disenfranchising eligible voters while raising concerns over transparency and accuracy in the state’s voter registration system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legal action by the two nonprofits came after reports surfaced that Virginians were being removed from the voter rolls due to alleged inaccuracies and outdated information. Many of these removals, the suit argues, were done without proper notification or investigation, leaving eligible voters unaware that they could no longer cast their ballots.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lawsuit also claims that the purges disproportionately affect minority communities, low-income voters, and those who may not have easy access to the internet to check their voter status. It further asserts that the Youngkin administration has failed to adequately confirm whether a voter is ineligible, potentially silencing their voice in the democratic process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Naturalized citizens serve in our armed forces, pay taxes, and show their patriotism daily with their acts and contributions to our society,” Monica Sarmiento, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights, said in a statement earlier this month.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Forcing new American communities to carry undue burden that no other community is required to comply with is discrimination, and does not represent the values that our commonwealth stands for,” Sarmiento said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Youngkin’s executive order, the Virginia Department of Elections is now required to send just one notice to individuals at risk of being removed from the voter rolls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This notice is based on information from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), but there is no requirement for the accuracy of that information to be verified by either the Department of Elections or local election officials before action is taken. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin County, said Monday that the law referenced in Youngkin’s executive order relates to persons who self-identify as “non-citizens” on DMV forms that are turned over to the State Board of Elections, which then checks the information against the voter rolls and notifies those persons of pending removal from the state’s voter registration list, giving them 14 days notice of removal and the right to challenge.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And there are failsafe measures to this,” Stanley said. “Even if they are subsequently removed from the rolls, let’s say, in error, those persons can still register to vote on Election Day under our ‘same day’ registration law. So I fail to see why the federal government is doing this but for no other reason but to try to upset our otherwise sound voter registration process here in Virginia for political purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview Monday afternoon that Youngkin’s executive order “brought together a lot of operating practices and standards that may have been scattered over a number of other places, put it together in one document and demonstrated to the commonwealth that the governor took this seriously and was exercising his responsibilities as the chief executive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the responsibilities of the executive branch, working with the legislative branch, is to “ensure confidence in our electoral processes and systems, and that was the whole intent of this, I think,” Anderson said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Elections Commissioner Susan Beals, whom Youngkin appointed as Virginia’s top elections official just weeks after assuming office in early 2021, said </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/08/08/virginias-top-elections-official-says-shes-confident-about-the-accuracy-of-results/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one week before the governor issued his executive order that a process to prohibit non-citizens from voting was already in place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Anybody who comes to the DMV and shows documents that indicate they are a non-citizen — whether it is a visa or residency — their name is sent to the Department of Elections on a monthly basis so we can double check to make sure that they did not make their way on our voter rolls. If we find them on the rolls, we cancel them,” Beals said in the interview. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Previous election access issues</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two lawsuits are the latest in a string of voting access issues during Youngkin’s tenure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia chapter of the NAACP took Youngkin to court last year to get answers but a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">judge ruled that most details are exempt from being shared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through a provision in the Freedom of Information Act. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Youngkin’s changes to the process aren’t going against the law, Democratic lawmakers feel it’s being used as a way to limit who can vote. The latest executive order falls amid </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/nx-s1-5147789/voting-election-2024-noncitizen-fact-check-trump" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continued allegations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that illegal immigrants are trying to vote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/23/trump-youngkin-urge-early-voting-during-tele-rally/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telephone rally</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Trump, Youngkin touted the purge of over 6,000 people as noncitizens. But a Washington Post review of records and interviews with election officials </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/10/09/youngkin-noncitizen-voters-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that most of the purge stemmed from paperwork errors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, like people forgetting to check a citizenship box. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also noted that of Virginia’s three illegal voting prosecutions to occur since 2022, none involved a question of citizenship.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks in the Patrick Henry Building Tuesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery efforts in Southwest Virginia following Hurricane Helene remain a priority for Gov. Glenn Youngkin as government resources continue to aid states affected by the storm’s devastation, including North Carolina, and soon Florida, where an extremely dangerous category 5 hurricane is predicted to make landfall Wednesday night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking to reporters in Richmond on Tuesday, Youngkin highlighted the progress made in restoring services in Virginia’s hardest-hit areas, especially in the mountainous regions in the western part of the commonwealth. He noted that power had been restored to all but less than 200 customers in remote areas, with full service expected soon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, all cell phone towers in the region have been repaired, ensuring communication abilities are back online.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boil water advisories for drinking water are down from 35 systems to 19 in the areas hardest hit by Helene, as water can still be used for other purposes. Test kits for well users are available at a disaster recovery </span><a href="https://www.vaemergency.gov/recover/hurricane-helene" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including one at the Damascus Shopping Mall in Washington County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two primary roads and 16 secondary roads remain impassable, Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are concerned about debris and chemicals in Claytor Lake in Pulaski County, and South Holston Lake in Washington County, as the bodies of water are used for hydroelectric power generation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe this will be a 10 to 12-day period of just assessing and getting cleanup personnel on site,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medical crews remain in the area, but Virginia does “not have a shortage,” of fluid </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-10-07/intravenous-fluids-shortage-baxter-international-marion-north-carolina" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">IV</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supplies, Youngkin said. Health systems, however, are still determining if elective procedures can be delayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Employment Commission is helping with job losses, Youngkin added, and the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is working with the </span><a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/10/04/usda-offers-resources-adds-flexibilities-disaster-assistance" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States Department of Agriculture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to assist with the potential “hundreds of millions of dollars of lost income from our agricultural community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individual assistance has been </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/10/05/list-of-localities-declared-under-a-major-disaster-grows-to-nine-in-southwest-virginia/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the counties of Montgomery and Pulaski, as public assistance for local governments, has been expanded to Lee County. Most of those who have sought assistance have primarily used the </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/assistance/individual" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FEMA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app, Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And less than two weeks after Helene hit the United States Southeast, claiming the lives of two in Virginia and over 227 people around the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-death-toll-asheville-north-carolina-34d1226bb31f79dfb2ff6827e40587fc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">region</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hurricane Milton is forecast to slam into the western coast of Florida.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Milton is expected to head across the state into the Atlantic Ocean without an impact to Virginia, unless there’s an unexpected turn, which Youngkin said on Tuesday gave him confidence to deploy search and rescue and emergency management teams to support North Carolina. a He also sent the Helicopter Aquatic Rescue Team, a partnership with Virginia National Guard and Chesterfield County firefighter and EMS crews, to Florida in preparation for Milton’s arrival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked by the Virginia Mercury about protections for Southwest Virginia in the event of future flood events since the hurricane </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/24/health-department-urges-preparedness-ahead-of-peak-storm-season/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">season</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lasts until Nov. 30, Youngkin said that “protections are hard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As much as we’d like to build a giant wall, in addition to the wall we should build at the southern border, we have to be prepared,” Youngkin said, renewing his request from last week to not get “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/04/youngkin-shares-update-on-helene-damage-in-virginia-urges-to-not-be-distracted-by-climate-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">distracted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” by discussions about climate change. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have great capabilities in order to make sure that loss of life is protected against, but, on top of that, we also know that our response capabilities are extraordinary as well,” Youngkin said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the study, which was presented to the commission at its meeting in Richmond Monday, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">found that the initiative, which offers tuition waivers to the spouses and children of military members who were killed or permanently disabled due to their service, has seen significant growth over the past five years.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the veterans population in the United States has seen a decline from 22 million to 18 million in the past decade according to Veterans Affairs Annual Benefits reports, the number of veterans with a 100% disability rating — the highest rating a veteran can receive for service-connected disabilities — has grown from from 400,000 in 2014 to 1.3 million in 2023, the review found.</span></p>

So if you look at it just in terms of that, you can make the case that maybe this program is going to start trending down and maybe we’re seeing a peak,” Justin Brown, JLARC’s senior associate director, told the panel. </span></p>

(Courtesy of Joint Legislative Audit &amp; Review Commission)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a “more powerful factor”  may be the rise in veterans with a higher disability rating, Brown said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don’t know which of these trends is going to prevail, but clearly there’s upward pressure on the disability side, while the big number of veterans is going down. So that complicates how you think about what might happen to the program in the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some lawmakers have expressed concern that the program is financially unsustainable, prompting them to implement eligibility changes during the 2024 General Assembly session. However, those changes were repealed in July, and in response, a Senate work group, a governor’s task force, and a study were established to review the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC review found that the number of relatives eligible to receive benefits has grown substantially since 2019, when the legislature approved a change that added added dependents of veterans whose death or disability due to military service in general — not just combat-related — to those who qualify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said that until these more recent changes to VMSDEP, the program enrollment was small enough “that it just didn’t represent really anything in the general fund budget, and it wasn’t really on the institutions’ radar from the financial perspective, because it was pretty small.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of 2022-23, undergraduate students accounted for about 89% of all VMSDEP participants.  Graduate students, though, have been increasing over time as a proportion of students benefiting from the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023-24 alone, VMSDEP enrollment in four-year colleges and universities has grown by 32%, JLARC data shows. In two-year colleges, it has increased by 47% during the same period. About half of total VMSDEP enrollment at four-year institutions is at Old Dominion University (20.6%), Virginia Commonwealth University (16.7%) and George Mason University (14.9%). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data also found that 82% of beneficiaries are biological children of veterans, with 15% of them being spouses and 3% adopted children. Nearly all (96%) receive benefits because of a veteran’s disability — only 1% are related to a veteran who was killed or missing in action or was declared a prisoner of war. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With beneficiaries essentially receiving a free college education, some Virginia universities have raised concerns about the increasing costs of enrolling more students under the program without tuition payments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s go back to Fiscal Year 2023, this was the year prior to when you started the process of providing general funds,” Brown told the committee. “In that year, it becomes a pretty large percentage of total revenue, and it’s just revenue that they&#8217;re not collecting due the waiver.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC review found that several institutions are using various means to compensate for forgone revenue, mostly by raising tuition and fees for other students, reducing or controlling operational spending, tapping into their general funds or institutional revenue. But quantifying the impact of VMSDEP on tuition remains “extremely difficult.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To offset some of the forgone revenue impact on public colleges and universities, the General Assembly earlier this year appropriated $20 million in general funds for fiscal year 2025 and 2026, with an additional $45 million each year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Council of Higher Education for Virginia (SCHEV), the commonwealth’s coordinating agency for higher education, began allocating new general funds to institutions in August, Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, when CNU reported that the forgone revenue caused by the program was 3.5% of the university’s total revenue, SCHEV filled that shortfall by providing available general funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, the JLARC study recommends that the General Assembly appropriate “sufficient general funds to cover 100% of institutions’ forgone revenue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, the program could be maintained at its current general fund level and the legislature could either distribute funds to institutions proportionally according to their percentage of total VMSDEP enrollment or according to institutions’ relative ability to absorb the forgone revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There will be winners and losers in that, I guarantee it, but that’s another way to do it. And we can help you think through that if you would like,” Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers could also follow a model from Texas and create a new fund with a combination of one-time and ongoing appropriations and apportion funds to institutions. In recent years, the fund in the Lone Star State has covered about 15% of its program cost, leaving the institutions on the hook for the remaining costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown warned lawmakers that when contemplating changes to the funding of the program, they would be advised to consider that many future participants in VMSDEP have already been certified eligible and several thousand are already certified, but not yet using the benefit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Depending on what you do, if you do anything, you’ll need to think about when something is effective,” Brown said. “I also think that there’s some minor changes in here that we’re going to give you as options that you could maybe do a little bit more quickly, bigger changes you might want to give some more lead time. But that’s just critically important for this particular program.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kayla Owens, co-founder of Friends of VMSDEP, called Monday’s JLARC presentation “disappointing, yet somewhat expected.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owens asked for the JLARC data to be made publicly accessible, and for the group submit to an audit of its research process. She also challenged the state to commit to an independent study of VMSDEP.</span></p>
<p>Mitch Rubenstein, commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of Virginia, said in a text message Monday that the VFW is reviewing the JLARC report.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The VFW urges all involved to put aside partisan politics and create a long term, sustainable path forward for this important program,” Rubenstein said.</span></p>

John McGuire, shown here campaigning with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in Louisa County in May, won his first election in Virginia's 5th Congressional District earlier this month. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a sign of deepening divisions among Republicans in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, at least four members of the district’s 37-member GOP Committee, including the vice chair, were ousted over the weekend, and another resigned after refusing to sign renewed loyalty pledges for state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, the party’s nominee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The four purged members and the resignee were among 25 Republican officials who in early June signed </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/06/06/top-gop-leaders-in-the-5th-district-urge-trump-to-reconsider-mcguire-endorsement/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an open letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> urging former President Donald Trump to reconsider his endorsement of McGuire, advocating instead for Trump’s support of U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, the incumbent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Herring, who has served as the committee’s vice chair for two years and the former chair of the Goochland County GOP, told members in an email Sunday that the Republican Party of Virginia’s decision to demand the renewed pledges was “unwarranted, unprecedented and unauthorized.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After consulting with Chris Marston, the RPV’s official legal counsel, other attorneys and past Republican officials, his belief was confirmed, Herring wrote in the email, which was obtained by The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In fact, it is very similar to the actions of prosecutors against Donald Trump. They make up allegations, find a politically weaponized judge, and then convict him knowing that all of this will probably be overturned on appeal,” Herring wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire has been a source of contention within the party since he announced his bid for Congress just one week after winning his seat in the 10th state Senate District last year — particularly among those backing Good, who went on to lose to McGuire in the June 18 primary election by a mere 366 votes out of more than 62,000 cast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after McGuire’s narrow victory was confirmed by a recount, which Good requested, and an </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/28/outcome-of-5th-district-gop-primary-unchanged-after-further-review-of-ballots/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the results, some Republican hardliners in the district have refused to accept the former Navy SEAL as their party’s nominee, instead turning to social media to launch </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/03/a-growing-number-of-5th-district-republicans-vow-to-write-in-good-on-nov-5/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a write-in campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on behalf of Good, who has not publicly supported this effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a Sept. 14 meeting of the executive committee of the RPV’s State Central Committee, the party’s 80-member governing body in Virginia, Jeff Ryer, chairman of the 1st Congressional District Committee and the spokesman for the Trump campaign in Virginia, expressed concern that McGuire lacked “fulsome support” in the 5th District, RPV Chair Rich Anderson said in a phone interview Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequently, Ryer made a motion for the committee to require a renewed loyalty pledge from the 25 party officials who had signed the letter to Trump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s an affirmation statement, I don’t call it a loyalty statement,” Anderson said. “It just reaffirms that they will support the eventual nominees that would come out of these contests, whether they are a primary or a party run process. And with all the contention down in the 5th District because of a hotly contested race, a number of our congressional district committee chairs were concerned that perhaps not all were going to support McGuire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in his email to committee members, Herring, the former vice chair, alleged that top party officials decided to “dictate to the 5th District Committee” members who had signed the Trump letter that they would have to “sign a loyalty oath or get kicked out” of the Republican Party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This decision was NOT brought to the (whole) State Central Committee for review or approval, and most were not even aware of this action,” Herring wrote, adding that the committee then agreed to “send a letter to those affected” and set a deadline by which they had to return their signed pledges for Sept. 27 at 5 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The form they sent in their letter was similar to the loyalty oaths they had required before, with the exception of one part … the naming of specific candidates you pledge to support. To my knowledge, this action has not been done before, at least in the over four decades that I have been involved,” Herring wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryer said Monday that he made the motion to ask for the renewed pledges because based on several news accounts it had become apparent that what he believed to be “a false narrative was developing that leaders in the party were not fully supportive of our nominees.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryer pushed back against allegations that the loyalty pledges had been used to force 5th District Republicans on the record in an effort to get them removed from the party as a punishment for asking Trump to reconsider his endorsement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was my hope — and the hope of the executive committee — that all who had signed the June 6 letter would fulfill their previously professed pledge to support all our nominees, as required by the party plan,” Ryer said, adding that he had made his motion solely in the capacity of his role as the 1st District chair and a longtime member of the State Central Committee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Rick Buchanan, the chairman of the 5th District GOP Committee, in an email to Anderson and State Central Committee leadership sent after the deadline had passed on Friday afternoon pointed out that members had already signed similar pledges of support earlier this year, as a requirement under the RPV’s party plan to attend mass meetings and conventions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he “immediately” forwarded the request for the renewed affirmations to the entire committee, Buchanan also said that no member of the State Central Committee had reached out to him directly or any of the district’s 24 unit chairs “to inquire about the necessity of this action as a remedy,” suggesting that the distrust between the two fractions was based on miscommunication.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hearsay and assumption lead directly to dysfunction. The truth can only be found by going straight to the source, and the SCC and RPV have yet to reach out to develop an understanding. Mr. Chairman, this is not the way to work together as brothers in our political fight against our common enemies,” Buchanan wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singling out Republican officials from the 5th District for supporting the candidate “we felt was the best candidate in a primary is more than an overreach,” Buchanan said in the email. “This action is pay-back for sending the letter to President Trump. Though some question the veracity of the letter, we firmly stand behind everything the letter says.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buchanan declined to comment for this story Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their letter to Trump, the district’s top GOP officials had hailed Good, the chairman of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, as a champion of America First policies “by introducing legislation to codify policies defunding chain migration and requiring that immigrants are self-sufficient.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his time in Congress, Good also offered multiple bills that would build upon Trump’s regulatory relief for businesses across the country, the party officials wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We the undersigned leaders of the 5th District Republican Congressional Committee strongly urge President Donald Trump to reconsider his endorsement of Congressman Bob Good’s opponent in the Republican Primary,” they concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After receiving the request for his renewed loyalty pledge, at least one 5th District Committee member — Glenn Mozingo of Cumberland County — handed in his resignation on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am writing to advise that I will not sign the pledge form that was enclosed with your letter dated September 16, 2024, and I am resigning as a member of the Cumberland County Republican Committee with immediate effect. I understand that my membership on the 5th District Congressional Committee will lapse as well,” Mozingo wrote in an email to RPV Executive Director Ken Nunnenkamp which was obtained by The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mozingo wrote that he wasn’t aware of any reservations among 5th District Committee members regarding their loyalties to Trump or Hung Cao, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Consequently, it is apparent that this is a transparent attempt to coerce each committee member to publicly go on record in support of John McGuire, which I will not do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he signed the pledge, James Hankins, another 5th District vice chair, also lashed out against RPV leadership. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On a personal leave I feel insulted by being asked to sign this,” Hankins wrote in an email to Anderson. “I am signing this form this one time. If I am ever asked to do this again, I will resign from all posts I hold with the Republican Party and I will never raise another dollar for the 5th.”</span></p>

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, the two leading declared candidates for governor, are tied at 39% support each, according to a </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/09/UMW-Survey-Topline-Two-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new statewide poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the University of Mary Washington’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining 22% of respondents in the survey of 1,000 adult Virginians said they were undecided, did not plan to vote,  would back another candidate or refused to answer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The poll is in line with the results from </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/09/UMW-Survey-Topline-One-1-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">another UMW survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that also found Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a tight contest in Virginia, with the Democrat edging her Republican opponent by 48-46%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanberger, who has represented Virginia’s 7th Congressional District since 2019, was the first candidate </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/11/13/abigail-spanberger-virginia-governor-00126815" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to announce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her gubernatorial bid in November 2023. Earle-Sears, the first Black woman in the commonwealth to hold statewide office, and the first woman to attain such a role since Mary Sue Terry’s tenure as attorney general in the 1990s, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/06/lt-gov-winsome-earle-sears-announces-run-for-virginia-governor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched her campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attorney General Jason Miyares, another potential Republican candidate for his party’s gubernatorial nomination, would be equally competitive in a general election, the poll found. In a possible match-up between Spanberger and Miyares, 40% of survey respondents backed Spanberger while 39% favored Miyares, well within the survey’s margin of error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares has not yet announced his intentions for 2025, but Virginia attorney generals often either run for re-election to the commonwealth’s top legal office or campaign to become governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Glenn Youngkin, the current governor, cannot run for re-election next year because of Virginia’s one consecutive term limit for governors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia elections are often close, and the look ahead to next year suggests more of the same in the campaign for governor,” said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington and director of UMW’s Center for Leadership and Media Studies. “The big challenge for these potential candidates is becoming better known across the commonwealth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians were more negative about the direction of the nation than about the direction of the commonwealth, with 24% saying Virginia was headed in the right direction and 26% saying it was headed in the wrong direction. The rest offered mixed views. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the nation overall, 51% of those surveyed said that things in the country were headed in the wrong direction, with only 16% saying the nation was on the right track.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginians in this new survey said they approved of Youngkin’s job performance by a 46 to 34% margin. As for President Joe Biden’s job performance, 37% of survey respondents approved while 53% disapproved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Elections never stop in Virginia, and 2025 looks to be another very interesting electoral year in the commonwealth,” Farnsworth said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UMW poll was conducted by Research America Inc. between Sept. 3 and 9, 2024. The survey included a total of 1,000 Virginia residents, consisting of 870 registered voters and 774 likely voters. The margin of error is +/- 4.1%. </span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce for The Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal judges in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond on Tuesday appeared sympathetic to the plaintiffs in a case challenging Virginia’s disenfranchisement of people with felony convictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a federal district judge </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/18/judge-rules-suit-against-virginia-felon-disenfranchisement-rule-can-proceed/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed the challenge to move forward</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> earlier this year, alleging that </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-voting-rights-aclu-virginia/article_90a9275e-e565-11ee-8466-3ff35b49eb1c.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has been out of compliance with a Reconstruction-era federal law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the 4th Circuit had a hearing on the state’s attempt to toss the case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deputy Solicitor General Kevin Gallagher, in defense of the state, said the “unique” and old federal statute “is not something that people are trying to enforce.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Defendants include Gov. Glenn Youngkin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth — who was Kay Coles James when the suit was first filed — and several election officials. Tuesday’s hearing was part of their interlocutory appeal limited to whether Virginia is entitled to sovereign immunity — basically, whether or not the state and its agents can be found to have done wrong or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An interlocutory appeal is a type of appeal that can be filed while a case is active and before a final judgment. Neither the interlocutory appeal nor the Readmission Act case have been ruled on yet. And though the appeal was the point of Tuesday’s meeting, discussion veered into the Readmission case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latter is focused on the 1870 Virginia Readmission Act, a federal law that allowed Virginia, a former Confederate state, to rejoin the U.S. Congress. Similar laws were also employed as other formerly Confederate states rejoined, with the condition that states’ constitutions could not be used to deprive anyone of voting rights, “except as punishment for such crimes that are now felonies at common law.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Common law” felonies were defined as a limited set of crimes, whereas today people with any felony conviction in Virginia permanently lose the right to vote unless a governor restores it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our claim is that essentially, Virginia made a promise when it was brought back into the United States Congress. It’s now time to keep that promise and to abide by the Virginia Readmission Act,” said ACLU attorney Vishal Agraharkar in a call with The Mercury on Monday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the defendants’ filing argues that Congress lacks the power to prohibit states from disenfranchising people with felony convictions under the Fourteenth Amendment in the U.S. Constitution and that states could choose to permanently disenfranchise people with felonies of all types, not just those in common law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the Tuesday hearing, Judge Roger Gregory noted Congress’ intent when using the Readmission Acts following the Civil War. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Congress) knew what (formerly-Confederate states) were going to do to newly-freed persons — they didn’t trust them,” Gregory said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gallager argued that the act was more limited to that time as a “contract between Congress and Virginia” to reenter the Union. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU is working on the case with the WilmerHale law firm and a voting rights group called Protect Democracy. Plaintiffs are Virginians with felony convictions who have tried to have their rights restored by Youngkin without success. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while it’s Virginia’s constitution which grants governors purview over restoration of rights that is at the core of the Readmission Act case, Youngkin has been at the center of legal challenges to restorations under his administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A once automatic process, Youngkin’s administration adjusted it last year to a petition-based one. As </span><a href="https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginians-whose-rights-have-been-restored-drops-in-second-year-of-youngkin-administration-reports-show/291-fbe59fc9-c488-4449-be3e-ad4c0ba1c374" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restoration numbers have dropped</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under his tenure as governor, </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/judge-finds-for-youngkin-administration-in-naacps-foia-case/article_210d11ec-9936-11ee-a87e-138606562546.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">various lawsuits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have sprung up </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/virginia-news/judge-rejects-lawsuit-but-compares-youngkins-power-to-restore-voting-rights-to-a-kings/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking answers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about criteria for restorations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a case by a man who sought answers about his restoration rejection was dismissed, the judge presiding over that case opined that “much like a monarch, the governor receives petitions for relief, may or may not rule upon them, and, when he does rule, need not explain his reasons.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judge Gregory was curious about criteria Tuesday as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do we know what the governor’s role is, really?” he posited. “Do we have facts, depositions about how that works and ‘how does he filter them out?’” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He then suggested that a deposition would be the “best way” to glean information “for the only person that can restore rights.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The court made no decision on the merits of the interlocutory appeal. From there, the Readmission Act case could potentially continue to be discussed and advance closer to a ruling. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With early voting now underway in Virginia, former President Donald Trump appears to have warmed up to the practice of sending out mail-in ballots to voters for the November general election — a position contrary to his many deprecatory comments regarding mail-in voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this election we must use every appropriate tool to beat the radical left Democrats, that’s why I am urging every Virginia patriot to vote early, and don’t wait,” Trump said during a telephone rally hosted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin Sunday evening. “You’ve heard a lot about voting by mail, but that’s what we have right now.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 15-minute call, Trump asked Republican voters to cast their ballots “either by mail, early in person or on election day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have long term voting, we used to have one day, paper ballots, all the things that you know we want to do, but you’re in the first group and I am asking you to get your friends, get your family, get everyone you know and make a plan to vote for Trump,” the GOP’s presidential nominee said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is one of just three states — the other two being Minnesota and South Dakota — where early voting started on Friday, 45 days before the Nov. 5 election. At least 59,686 Virginians have since cast their ballots as of Sunday evening, according </span><a href="https://www.vpap.org/elections/early-voting/#2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Virginia Public Access Project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With just 895 returned ballots, mail-in voting marked just a fraction of the total number of votes cast by that time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has consistently spoken against mail-in voting on the campaign trail while spouting conspiracy theories and falsely claiming that the 2020 presidential election that he lost to Democrat Joe Biden by more than 7 million votes had been stolen from him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mail-in voting is totally corrupt. Get that through your head. It has to be,&#8221; </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/06/29/trump-attack-vote-by-mail-election-ad/74218068007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at a rally in Michigan in February. And during an </span><a href="https://www.gbnews.com/politics/us/donald-trump-interview-nigel-farage-in-full-watch" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">interview with the British GB News</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March, he asserted that “anytime the mail is involved, you’re going to have cheating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump’s cautious embrace of early and mail-in voting aligns with the GOP’s slow acceptance of a practice that has expanded the tent of voters nationwide in recent years and proven to be beneficial for increasing turnout on both sides of the aisle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Both campaigns are really talking about the election in apocalyptic terms, and this is really motivating voters,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Early voting absolutely works for campaigns; you don&#8217;t have to worry about getting voters to the polls on election day. If the ballot is locked in at election time, it gets a lot easier, and election officials can focus on voters who haven’t made it to the polls,” Farnsworth said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During Sunday’s telephone rally, Trump rattled off a list of different ways for Virginians to cast their ballots early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every county in Virginia has at least one early voting location, so that’s important to know. Most counties have early voting Monday through Friday. Any registered Virginia voter can get out and vote as early as possible, you can vote tomorrow,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump said that he could be the first Republican presidential candidate to carry Virginia since President George W. Bush won his reelection bid in 2004. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Because if we are really going at it, we have a really good chance to win Virginia, there hasn’t been one in decades by a presidential candidate,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump still faces an uphill battle in the commonwealth, where he trails Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, by 10 percentage points, according to a </span><a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/2024-election-state-polls" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morning Consult poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted between Aug. 30 and Sept. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a </span><a href="https://www.umw.edu/news/2024/09/20/new-survey-from-umw-center-for-leadership-and-media-studies-takes-closer-look-at-presidential-election-in-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more recent survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the University of Mary Washington released last week found that the race has since tightened, with Harris leading Trump with just 48 to 46% in a two-way contest, within the poll’s margin of error.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Democrats, however, pushed back against the narrative that the presidential race in the commonwealth was competitive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“While Trump is literally phoning it in here in Virginia, Team Harris-Walz and Virginia Democrats are turning unmatched enthusiasm into action, highlighting the stark contrast between Vice President Harris’ new way forward and Trump’s extreme Project 2025 agenda that would give him unchecked control over our daily lives,” said Virginia Democratic Party chair Susan Swecker. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris has yet to campaign in the commonwealth as the Democratic presidential nominee. Her husband, Douglas Emhoff, is set to visit Charlottesville on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also on Sunday’s call, Youngkin reiterated that elections in Virginia are safe and that voters can trust the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have paper ballots, we have counting machines, not voting machines, lock boxes are under 24-7 security, and we have a great process to make sure that the ballots are not only kept but custody is clear. And finally, non-citizens will be prosecuted if they vote,” he said.</span></p>

(Parker Michels-Boyce / For the Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting Friday, voters across Virginia can begin casting their ballots in this year’s critical elections for the White House, a U.S. Senate seat, and  the state’s 11 congressional districts that will not only impact the future of the commonwealth but also help shape next year’s gubernatorial race. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/election-law/proposed-amendments-for-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Constitution of Virginia and a variety of local offices are also on the ballot. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Sep. 20 kick-off of the 45-day early voting period, Virginians have the option to vote in person until Nov. 2 at their local election offices or send absentee ballots by mail. This marks a turning point in campaign season, as both parties ramp up rallies and events to energize their bases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just south of Richmond, Gov. Glenn Youngkin will attend a rally at Chesterfield County Airport Saturday. He will be joined by U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, Bill Moher, the Republican nominee in Virginia’s 4th Congressional District, and Hung Cao, who is seeking to oust U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin in a statement Thursday encouraged “every Virginia citizen to make a plan and vote early” to ensure that each vote is counted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can trust that Virginia’s elections are secure with clean voter rolls, secure paper ballots, certified counting machines and well-trained election officials,” he said. </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin at an early voting rally in Henrico County in 2023. (Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later on Saturday, Youngkin will join Derrick Anderson, the Republican nominee in the 7th District, at an Early Voting Rally at the Professional Building Maintenance in Fredericksburg. The event is set to begin at 1:30 p.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former President Donald Trump has yet to return to the </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/28/trump-rallies-in-chesapeake-backed-by-virginia-governor-gop-leaders/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign trail in Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a state where he trails Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by several percentage points </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/new-polling-finds-harris-ahead-of-trump-by-a-comfortable-margin-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to recent polling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Rally Virginia is hosting a Women’s Rally for the Republican presidential nominee at the Trump Winery in Charlottesville on Saturday. The event  starts at 2 p.m., featuring guest speaker U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-NY.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Team Trump Virginia has been working diligently to ensure an impressive  — and winning — performance in Virginia’s early vote. Across the commonwealth, we have been priming our voters to turn out in record numbers. Trump Force 47 will be mobilizing our supporters to vote,” said Jeff Ryer, a campaign spokesman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While much of Southwest Virginia leans Republican, Democrats are firing up their bases there with some events, like an early voting kickoff event in Roanoke Friday to support Democratic candidates for city council and mayor, a canvassing kickoff on Saturday in Bristol with local elected officials, ad a Sunday gathering in Montgomery County with 9th District Democratic nominee Karen Baker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Urging citizens of the Southwest region of the state to take advantage of early voting, Bristol city councilor Neil Osborne said, “Don’t risk having something unexpected come up on Election Day.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine will jaunt around the state for various early voting events over the weekend to support Democratic congressional candidates in competitive races — such as Eugene Vindman in the 7th District, Suhas Subramanyam in the 10th and Missy Cotter Smasal in the 2nd — and to boost his own re-election campaign. </span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friday gatherings will also be hosted with Democratic challengers Leslie Mehta in Chesterfield County, who wants to unseat Wittman and 5th District candidate Gloria Witt. The 5th District election </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/16/amid-internal-gop-feud-in-the-5th-district-democrat-gloria-witt-sees-her-chance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could test the effect</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of GOP infighting over nominee John McGuire, a state senator from Goochland, and Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, whose supporters have mounted a write-in campaign after the incumbent lost his primary this summer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we’ve already held over 1,000 events across the Commonwealth, but (there’s) more to come,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic Party of Virginia chairwoman Susan Swecker. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a big week with the kickoff for early voting.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On boosting awareness of the different campaigns and to encourage early voting, Swecker said that Democrats have opened 25 campaign offices around the state and hired 150 people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As election seasons become increasingly competitive, early voting has emerged as a vital part of the electoral process, and Virginia is no exception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early voting allows voters to participate on their own schedules, whether by visiting local election offices or mailing in absentee ballots. In recent elections, both parties have recognized its significance — a shift that is reshaping the strategies of political campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voters like the convenience of early voting options,” said Mark Rozell, a political scientist at George Mason University. “Importantly, Republicans have adjusted to the reality that early voting is here to stay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, Youngkin’s political action committee </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/glenn-youngkin-virginia-politics-election-day/article_f250116c-6936-11ee-9bad-2b7f054e466e.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invested millions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the promotion of early voting initiatives, following years of GOP opposition to the expanded options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Past GOP leadership claims that early voting leads to fraud likely had some negative impact on Republican turnout,” Rozell said. “The smart strategy now is to embrace the reality and use flexible voting options as a means to mobilize core supporters.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But opponents of early voting are not devoid of credible arguments, Rozell added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot can happen in October that might affect the viewpoints of those who voted in Virginia in late September. You can’t take it back once you’ve voted, so you better be sure when you vote that your opinion will not change under any circumstance.”</span></p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ways to vote early</h4>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To vote early in-person, registered voters may go to the general registrar’s office for the jurisdiction in which they are registered, present their ID and cast a ballot. The location of the general registrar’s offices for all jurisdictions can be found on the Virginia Department of Elections’ </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation/PublicContactLookup" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in addition to </span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/voterid/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a list</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of acceptable forms of identification. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Requested absentee ballots will also be mailed beginning Friday, including ballots to registered military and overseas voters. Any registered voter can request an absentee ballot either in person, by mail, </span><a href="https://vote.elections.virginia.gov/VoterInformation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">online</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or by contacting their general registrar’s office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Registered voters do not need a reason to request an absentee ballot, which can be dropped off at the general registrar’s office or polling location on Election Day. Absentee ballots returned by mail must be postmarked no later than Nov. 5 and received by noon on Nov. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline to request a mailed absentee ballot is Oct. 25, but amid national U.S. Postal Service delays, state officials suggest those voting by mail </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/05/virginias-top-elections-official-warns-of-possible-delays-in-mail-in-voting-this-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">do so as soon as possible</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The deadline to register to vote and cast a regular ballot is Oct. 15. After that date, voters can still register and vote on Election Day using same-day registration, but they will cast a provisional ballot. Same-day registration must be done in person, either at an early voting location within the voter’s jurisdiction or at their polling place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some jurisdictions offer early in-person voting at satellite locations in addition to the general registrar’s office. Dates and times vary by j</span><a href="https://www.elections.virginia.gov/casting-a-ballot/early-voting-office-locations/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">urisdiction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curbside voting is available for voters with disabilities and those 65 and older who prefer to vote in person. For details on voting hours, additional locations, and ballot drop boxes, contact your local registrar&#8217;s office.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Ben Crump Law)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A newly released report by the disAbility Law Center of Virginia (dLCV) reveals that the death of Irvo Otieno, who </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2023-03-29/irvo-otieno-henrico-county-funeral" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was killed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie County during a mental health crisis while in police custody last year, could have been prevented had sheriff’s deputies and hospital staff not used prone restraint, a controversial method of subduing individuals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a presentation of the findings before the House Appropriations Committee at the state Capitol in Richmond Tuesday, Colleen Miller, the dLCV’s executive director, urged lawmakers to end the criminalization of mental illness, remove law enforcement from the state’s response to people with mental health episodes and address the conditions in Virginia’s jails, where thousands of inmates with mental illness are being kept.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is serious reform needed in Virginia, because the events that happened to Mr. Otieno resulted in his death, and it got a lot of media attention. But people with mental illness are encountering these issues every single day in Virginia, and we need to do something about it,” Miller told the panel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Otieno, a 28-year-old man with a history of mental health challenges, died on March 6, 2023, after being transported from the Henrico County Jail to Central State Hospital. The dLCV confirmed that sheriff’s deputies and hospital staff’s use of prone restraint — a technique where an individual is held face down — was a key factor in Otieno’s death. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The thing that led to his death, the prone restraint, is prohibited in our state facilities, and yet at Central State Hospital he was placed face down, people piled on top of him, and it killed him. So we really need to think about how to eliminate the prone restraint,” Miller said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ten Henrico County deputies and hospital workers were </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irvo-otieno-killed-deputies-charged-virginia-hospital-ed9d227abea1bfa6946aa7cade5ced8b" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially charged</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with second-degree murder in Otieno’s death, which was captured on video. But prosecutors later asked a Dinwiddie Circuit Court judge </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/irvo-otieno-hospital-death-criminal-charges-dropped-b1b6cf44a3c6a33a37a69e657cc821c8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to dismiss</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the charges against seven of the accused. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation by the dLCV, a non-profit designated by the federal government as the protection and advocacy organization for people with disabilities in Virginia, also found that while jailed in Henrico’s Regional Jail West for three days after suffering a mental health episode, Otieno was subjected to hours — possibly days — in an emergency restraint chair, and the jail failed to provide him with any psychiatric treatment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A restraint chair all by itself can be very dangerous, you are kind of caved in on yourself while you are in that chair, making it difficult to breathe. The correctional restraints require that someone be restrained only as long as necessary, while they are acting out,” Miller said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Otieno’s initial encounter with police and the hospital emergency room to his incarceration and transfer to Central State Hospital, the </span><a href="https://www.dlcv.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IO-Public-Report-8.19.24-Near-Final.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">27-page report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> details “a complete breakdown of Virginia’s mental health crisis system, compounded by a culture of criminalizing individuals with mental illness, particularly communities of color.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system that was supposed to help Otieno “utterly and completely failed him,” the investigation concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, the committee’s vice chair, called the report “disturbing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been trying to work on this area, and law enforcement is getting training in many places,” Sickles said. “Maybe it’s not uniform, I don’t know what happened in Henrico, but they are training law enforcement every day in dealing with people who have serious mental illness, and they need the appropriate training.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles emphasized the ongoing struggle to fill positions for mental health workers in Virginia, despite the legislature’s approval of additional funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We don’t have professional staffers, we are trying to fund psychiatric residencies, there is a shortage of all these mental health workers. We would hire them, we have openings,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sickles also pointed to housing shortages as a significant barrier, noting that many patients remain in hospitals longer than necessary due to a lack of community housing options. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They shouldn’t be in these situations, and we are working on this,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, called Otieno’s death a “tragedy on every level.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willett is the sponsor of </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=241&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB1242" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1242</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, also dubbed Irvo’s Law, that the General Assembly passed earlier this year. The measure allows family members and caregivers to access loved ones who are in crisis during their emergency room evaluations, unless the presence of a family member would create a medical or safety risk or if the patient objects to their presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Irvo’s mom never got the chance to provide that information,” Willett said. “It’s such an unfortunate situation, and it’s also unfortunate that we need to have these terrible situations to inspire action. But we already took action before Irvo’s terrible death, and we are certainly going to take more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature this year also backed Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2023/december/name-1018721-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right help, right now”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> initiative, which marked a major investment in building emergency room alternatives to care for patients experiencing a behavioral health crisis, among other measures to address mental health challenges in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Del. Delores McQuinn, D-Richmond, said that Virginia’s jails, police and sheriff’s departments still are not equipped to deal with situations involving mental health episodes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I talk often to my sheriffs in Richmond and Henrico County about these issues, and they are overloaded with individuals who have mental health challenges, and they really don’t have a clue of what to do with them,” McQuinn said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is something that all of us must get to the table and bring some greater resolution to this, and I don’t think it’s going to happen swiftly, it’s going to be some years to get where we are trying to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The timeline of the dLCV’s investigation shows the importance of removing law enforcement from mental health treatment, said Miller, the group’s executive director. “Everything that law enforcement is trained to do is contrary to what is necessary for a mental health response. They are trained to be intimidating, to be tough, to never retreat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers and stakeholders “should do some hard thinking” about how to protect people and help them get the treatment that they need,” Miller concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have seen different places throughout the timeline where Mr. Otieno was determined to need medical and mental health care and was prevented from getting that, time and time again.” </span></p>

Gov. Winsome Sears presides over the Senate. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears on Thursday evening officially announced her candidacy for governor of Virginia in the upcoming 2025 election, aiming to become the nation’s first Black female governor. Sears made history in 2022 by becoming the first Black woman in the commonwealth to hold statewide office, and the first woman to attain such a role since Mary Sue Terry’s tenure as attorney general in the 1990s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The future, a new chapter, is about to begin,” Earle-Sears said at a rally in Virginia Beach. “Together, we have the power to ensure that our brightest days are ahead of us still. But to make that future a reality, we must come together, it is really that simple. We must stand strong, we must support each other, we must share each other’s values and visions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earle-Sears’s candidacy marks a significant milestone in Virginia’s political landscape. Should she become the Republican nominee, she would likely face U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William, who was the first candidate </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/spanberger-virginia-governor-candidacy-c19ade683ab0dfaef67051b36791d30a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to announce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her bid in November. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​Spanberger is the only Democrat currently seeking her party’s nomination, after Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney dropped his bid to instead run for lieutenant governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Earle-Sears announcing her run for governor of Virginia was expected, because the lieutenant  governor role is often seen as a stepping stone to the state’s highest office,” said David Richards, a political scientist at the University of Lynchburg. “Glenn Youngkin is a popular governor and so Earle-Sears should try to take advantage of that to go to the next level.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A trailblazer in Virginia politics, Earle-Sears first made history in 2021 when she was elected as the state’s first Black woman to hold statewide office. Her rise in the GOP has been marked by her strong conservative values, her advocacy for education reform, and her emphasis on public safety — themes that are expected to play a central role in her gubernatorial campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A native of Kingston, Jamaica, Earle-Sears, 60, immigrated to the United States at the age of 6. She grew up in the Bronx, New York City, and served as an electrician in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1983 until 1986. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also directed a Salvation Army homeless shelter before launching her career in public service in 2001, when she was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, representing the 90th District, becoming the first Jamaican-American, female Republican,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">first female veteran, and first naturalized citizen to serve in the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On her path to seize the Republican nomination for governor Earle-Sears will likely face Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is also speculated to announce his candidacy in the coming weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another obstacle for Earle-Sears may be her decision in November 2022 to </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/politics/virginia-lt-gov-earle-sears-time-to-move-on-from-trump/3205900/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly withdraw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> her support for former President Donald Trump, who at the time was teasing an announcement for a third White House run — a move that might haunt her as the Republican nominee for president has shown little tolerance for disloyalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A true leader understands when they have become a liability. A true leader understands that it’s time to step off the stage. And the voters have given us that very clear message,” Earle-Sears said in a TV interview with Fox News at the time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on Thursday, Earle-Sears left no doubt about her return into the Make America Great Again fold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is such a great country, God bless America. And folks, first and foremost, in 2024, that means standing with President Trump, it means standing with [Republican nominee] Hung Cao for our Senate, and it means that we must stand very steadfast with our incumbents so they can continue to defend Virginia’s best interests in Congress,” she told her audience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some Trump loyalists already pushed back against an Earle-Sears candidacy over her previous remarks about the former president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She’s an insufferable, never-Trumper that’s totally myopic and self serving,” conservative talk show host John Fredericks wrote on the social media platform X on Thursday, suggesting that the lieutenant governor’s bid “might as well be paid for and authorized” by Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Once again, it’s all about Winsome Sears, and it’s all about screwing Trump — because that’s all she does,” Fredericks said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Richards, the political scientist, said that it is possible for Earle-Sears to overcome her rocky relationship with Trump and secure her party’s nomination. “She is popular with state Republicans, polling ahead of Miyares in a survey earlier this year. Whether she can replicate Youngkin’s 2021 surprise win statewide remains to be seen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, an Earle-Sears v. Spanberger matchup would be historic, Richards said. “Two women running for governor of Virginia, and Earle-Sears would be the first Black woman and, if elected, the first person since the 1700s to be governor not born in the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At her rally in Virginia Beach on Thursday, Earle-Sears vowed that she would mount a good fight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Winning Virginia is not just possible, it is necessary because the Democrats have had a headstart and they are fighting tooth and nail to win in November. And they want to win in November 2025 as well, but we are not going to let them. So, let’s roll up our sleeves and let’s get to work,” she said. </span></p>
