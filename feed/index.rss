(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — As U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson vies to keep his gavel, President-elect Donald Trump on Monday gave the Louisiana Republican a major boost with his “Complete &amp; Total Endorsement.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s coveted backing — just days ahead of Friday’s House vote to elect a speaker — came as Johnson sat in the hot seat over a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-clears-bill-avert-government-shutdown-extend-farm-bill" target="_blank">government shutdown quarrel</a> earlier this month that exacerbated public dissatisfaction from several of his GOP colleagues over his leadership.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The spending fight also put a spotlight on his vulnerabilities in securing the votes to win the speakership again.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration,” Trump said in a Monday post on&nbsp;<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113742374534233751" target="_blank">Truth Social</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The soon-to-be president described Johnson as a “good, hard working, religious man,” noting that “he will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a post on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/speakerjohnson/status/1873758339324362916?s=46" target="_blank">X</a> shortly after the endorsement, Johnson said he was “honored and humbled” by Trump’s support. “Together, we will quickly deliver on your America First agenda and usher in the new golden age of America,” he added.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Tensions flare</h4>
<p dir="ltr">But Johnson has failed to secure the backing of every House GOP colleague —&nbsp;which will be critical in a chamber Republicans will hold by a razor-thin margin. His opponents include Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who said he would not be voting for the incumbent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a post on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1873776475264213174" target="_blank">X</a>, Massie said: “I respect and support President Trump, but his endorsement of Mike Johnson is going to work out about as well as his endorsement of Speaker Paul Ryan.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ve seen Johnson partner with the democrats to send money to Ukraine, authorize spying on Americans, and blow the budget,” he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In an earlier Monday post on&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1873684971526955030" target="_blank">X</a>, Massie noted he was the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/paul-ryan-easily-wins-reelection-as-speaker-of-the-house-233139" target="_blank">only Republican</a> to not vote for former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan’s reelection to the speakership in 2017.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Mike Johnson is the next Paul Ryan,” Massie said. He urged his colleagues to join him in voting against the Louisiana Republican “because history will not give America another ‘do-over.’”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Massie has not said whom he would prefer for the position.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In another post&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1873704602513924355" target="_blank">on X</a>, Massie said he thinks no one will run for speaker until “Johnson concedes that he can’t be Speaker” and “Trump weighs in.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“To step up before then, or to nominate someone before then, is to doom that candidacy,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Indiana GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz has also been vocal in her dissatisfaction of Johnson’s leadership and so far has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6366548934112" target="_blank">refused to commit to voting</a> for his reelection.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Monday, Spartz laid out&nbsp;<a href="https://spartz.house.gov/media/press-releases/spartz-it-will-take-bold-and-decisive-leadership-reverse-titanic-its-0" target="_blank">several demands</a> for whoever becomes the next leader, saying: “Our next speaker must show courageous leadership to get our country back on track before this ‘Titanic’ strikes an iceberg at any moment.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We must have a vision and a concrete PLAN to deliver on President Trump’s agenda for the American people, which I have not seen from our current speaker despite countless discussions and public promises,” she added, comparing federal spending to the iceberg that caused the infamous nautical disaster.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spokespeople for House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York did not immediately respond Monday to a message seeking comment.</p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters on April 8, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lawmakers consider Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposal to provide vehicle tax relief for Virginians and ultimately eliminate the property tax, policymakers can find comfort after repeals in Rhode Island and Georgia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of Virginia&#8217;s cities, counties and towns are subject to a personal property tax, which helps fund their respective governments. Municipalities are likely to be impacted by such a relief or repeal proposal, including some, like Chesapeake, that have been grappling with reforming vehicle-related taxes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 18, Youngkin said a family of four in Virginia pays about $290 on their vehicle taxes annually during his address to lawmakers and cabinet members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let&#8217;s give Virginia families relief on the most hated tax in America since the tax on tea &#8211; the local car tax,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the governor did not include a plan to repeal the tax when he first raised the idea last December, this year he proposed an amendment to the current biennium budget to allocate $1.1 billion into a car tax credit fund to provide income tax rebates to nearly 1.9 billion taxpayers earning up to $50,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals or $100,000 for couples filing jointly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible taxpayers would receive up to $150 for individual returns or $300 for joint returns annually for the next three years. After the fund is exhausted, the state would see a permanent reduction of $360 million in tax revenues each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If successful, Virginia would join several states and jurisdictions that do not impose a vehicle tax including the District of Columbia, Georgia, Maryland and Rhode Island.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Nov. 7, 2023 </span><a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2023/rpt/pdf/2023-R-0196.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> completed in Connecticut, which was studying tax repeals, Rhode Island and Georgia over the past seven years repealed their vehicle property tax either by adjusting tax calculation factors by an increasing amount over a number of years, or enacting it only for taxpayers that perform a triggering action, such as applying for a vehicle title.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia and Rhode Island took different approaches to address local governments’ revenue losses. Rhode Island reimbursed revenue losses from general appropriations and adjusted reimbursements based on sales tax revenues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Georgia replaced its state and local annual property and sales taxes with a one-time per owner tax, divided between the state and municipalities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, West Virginia </span><a href="https://www.wvnews.com/mountainstatesman/news/taylor-county-west-virginia-assessor-explains-hb2526-and-the-motor-vehicle-property-tax-adjustment-credit/article_182eafb2-257e-11ee-afe4-8ba9d7735e92.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a fully refundable tax credit to eliminate the tax’s impact on residents while holding municipalities harmless, which took effect in 2024.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1998, Virginia developed a vehicle tax </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title58.1/chapter35.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">relief program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but the reimbursement rate starting at 12.5% was frozen at 70% in 2021, below the anticipated 100%, due to unforeseen costs as new car values increased substantially faster than inflation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers will start their 45-day session discussing proposed bills and budget amendments on Jan. 8.</span></p>

<p>Using a license plate number to find a suspect isn’t new to crime solving, but finding that license plate in an autonomously-captured and organized data log, rather than by humans looking through security footage or searching in-person, is more novel.</p>
<p>It’s part of a growing system of “Internet of Things” (IoT) technologies — networks of physical objects that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with other devices or software. These IoT devices are often called “smart cities” devices, because they’re used by states and cities that are aiming to improve services, including making their roads safer and more efficient for drivers and pedestrians.</p>
<p>People on the roads are likely used to red light and security cameras at intersections, but advancements in cloud technology and artificial intelligence allow transit agencies and cities to collect far more data than ever before, and to use that data in more strategic ways.</p>
<p>But with increased monitoring, data collection and analysis comes ethical and privacy concerns.</p>
<p>There’s never been a problem with checking a license plate to see if a car is stolen or otherwise wanted, said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project said. But when that license plate data is retained for an unknown amount of time and for an undetermined purpose, it could infringe on privacy and civil liberties.</p>
<p>“As this technology becomes increasingly denser in our communities, and at a certain point you have like three of them on every block, it becomes the equivalent to tracking everybody by using GPS,” Stanley said. “That raises not only policy issues, but also constitutional issues.”</p>
<p>The residents of St. Helena, in Napa Valley, likely aren’t upset that the technology was used for its intended purpose to help find the perpetrator of a crime, Hari Balakrishnan, a computer science and AI researcher and professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of the August arrest.</p>
<p>“I might posit that we should move from what is the data being collected to what is being done with the data?” he said. “By whom and for what purpose?”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What are smart cities technologies? </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, cities have begun to use hardware, like cameras and sensors, that record and sort information into databases with the help of AI. They usually do so with a specific objective in mind, like tracking the safety of a pedestrian crosswalk, monitoring speeding in an area or to help traffic flow better through intersections during rush hour.</p>
<p>The hardware devices can signal to the city’s software to take action, like turn the light green, or record data in a stored area for people to analyze later on. Many of these interconnected  systems are called intelligent transportation systems (ITS), said Nathan Kautz, a senior transportation safety engineer based in Tampa, Florida. Some can even detect traffic accidents and trigger an EMS response, and then help that EMS vehicle get to the scene of an accident faster by greenlighting it through traffic signals.</p>
<p><a href="https://fdotwww.blob.core.windows.net/sitefinity/docs/default-source/safety/shsp-2021/shsp_mar21.pdf?sfvrsn=5452dad_0" target="_blank">Florida’s Strategic Highway Safety Plan from 2021 </a>identifies monitoring speed as a proven way to reduce traffic fatalities, and outlines that it will use ITS infrastructure as a countermeasure. The technical systems allow for monitoring without the use of police officers stationed throughout the roadways.</p>
<p>“It allows you to get coverage of that corridor and try to keep speeds at an appropriate level when nobody’s watching, to improve the safety and the survivability at outcomes for say, like for a pedestrian or bicyclist,” Kautz said.</p>
<p>Balakrishnan has been working in IoT and mobile computing for the last two decades, and founded Cambridge Mobile Telematics about 15 years ago. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company gathers data from IoT devices like smartphones, connected vehicles, dash cameras and third-party devices to detect driving behavior.</p>
<p>The company works with insurance and auto companies, as well as rideshare companies, to promote safe driving by using data obtained by driving behavior to assess risk, safety, claims, and driver improvement programs. Balakrishnan said the company estimates it helped prevent about 80,000 crashes and about 40,000 serious injuries.</p>
<p>Another form of technology some cities are using is LiDAR, which uses lasers to bounce light off of objects to measure distance. It’s the foundational technology of Ouster, which makes hardware and software, and works with cities on traffic concerns as well as with clients in the security, industrial and automotive industries. The traffic sensors are currently posted at about 250 intersections in California, Florida, Tennessee, Utah and Colorado.</p>
<p>The technology’s lasers bounce heat off objects, and reflect distance back to the sensor. It uses that data to create 3-D anonymous models of the people and vehicles at street level, the Bay Area company’s VP of Smart Infrastructure Itai Dadon said.</p>
<p>“You understand depth, you understand scale, you understand position in space. You don’t have to infer all that like we do with cameras,” he said. “And on top of that, you can do it without invading the privacy of either your employees or the community that you’re servicing.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ethical and data privacy concerns </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>There are primarily two ways that IoT technologies work — infrastructure or mobile devices. And the factor of whether a user has control over the device is where privacy considerations come into play, Balakrishnan said.</p>
<p>Cambridge Mobile Telematics’ device, which users voluntarily place in their car and communicate with other IoT devices to track their driving, is an example of a mobile device. It’s similar to a wearable fitness tracker that collects data as you workout or sleep, Balakrishnan said.</p>
<p>“You’re using it for yourself. And I don’t think anyone reasonably would apply the word ‘surveillance’ to that,” Balakrishnan said. “If you don’t want it, don’t use it.”</p>
<p>But IoT devices embedded into infrastructure, like cameras or sensors on stop light poles, inductive loops under pavement that detect vehicles at stoplights, or automatic license plate readers, are not something that people opt into.</p>
<p>“If somebody puts a bunch of cameras on the road and they say that this is for measuring your speeding and sending tickets, okay, there’s warnings, and that’s the law, or that’s the way the rules are,” Balakrishnan said. “But now, if somebody took that data and used it for purposes that was not explicitly intended, then one could say, ‘hey, there’s some surveillance happening.’”</p>
<p>The use of these connected cameras and traffic monitoring systems are being applied across the country on a case-by-case basis. Some states, like Maine, <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/me/title-29-a-motor-vehicles/me-rev-st-tit-29-a-sect-2117.html" target="_blank">prohibit traffic cameras</a> from enforcing traffic violations except on toll roads. Others, like Missouri, allow them by law, but the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/documents/missouri_ae2018_survey.pdf" target="_blank">state supreme court ruled it is unconstitutional </a>to issue traffic violations unless the state can prove the identity of the driver at the time of citation.</p>
<p>It often comes down to the county or municipality, since there is no federal legislation on data privacy in traffic enforcement.</p>
<p>“All cities and municipalities are very different and have slightly different problems, but they all want, at the end of the day … the benefits for the community,” Dadon said. “However, sometimes they lack the understanding of what the technology can actually do, and by wanting to do good, sometimes run a little bit fast.”</p>
<p>That was the case in San Diego, starting in 2016. The city installed 3,200 “smart streetlights” to deter crime and to log data from license plate readers, but citizens grew concerned with privacy, saying the city wouldn’t tell them how the data could be used, and it would be shared with third parties, <a href="https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/investigations/san-diego-police-looks-to-reinstall-cameras-and-license-plate-readers/509-c6f34079-b157-4b4b-bac1-97ba3d4908ef" target="_blank">CBS8 reported last year</a>.</p>
<p>The police department eventually began using the cameras as a crime-fighting surveillance tool, which led community members to allege that the program was violating their privacy and targeting people of color. The city ended the program shortly after also due to budget concerns, but it <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/100-smart-streetlight-cameras-installed-san-diego/3443549/" target="_blank">began installing cameras again in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>A perceived benefit of camera traffic surveillance is that fewer traffic stops or direct interactions with police officers could decrease the number of arrests made of people of color. But the technology hasn’t proven to eliminate racial factors. A <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/chicagos-race-neutral-traffic-cameras-ticket-black-and-latino-drivers-the-most" target="_blank">ProPublica investigation in 2022</a> found that traffic surveillance programs in New York, Miami, Washington D.C. and Chicago still ticketed people of color and people from lower-income neighborhoods more than white drivers.</p>
<p>And the systems can’t work toward the benefit of the community if they’re not being used properly. A woman in Detroit is <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2024/09/16/detroit-police-license-plate-readers-isoke-robinson-car-shooting/75189126007/" target="_blank">suing the police department</a> after she was wrongfully arrested for a drive-by shooting in 2023 where police incorrectly used data from the city’s automatic license plate reader.</p>
<p>Instead of searching for a reported license plate number in the system, police searched for any plates that belong to white Dodge Chargers, and found one on a camera two miles from the crime scene. The woman they arrested had been recorded driving just blocks from her home, and had no connection to the crime other than the similar make and model of her car.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">IoT and privacy legislation </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Because there’s no federal direction on data privacy of smart cities systems, it will continue to be up to cities, or even municipalities, to make their own rules, said Daniel Weitzner, the founding director of the Internet Policy Research Initiative at MIT.</p>
<p>Cities often work with private technology companies to establish these intelligent transportation systems, and have a <a href="https://smart-cities-marketplace.ec.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/2023/solution-booklet-public-procurement-smart-cities" target="_blank">procurement bid process</a>. It’s why Balakrishnan said cities or states looking to install these technologies have to clearly outline what data is being collected and who has access to it.</p>
<p>Balakrishnan and Dadon warn that cities looking to enter contracts with smart city systems companies have to ask the right questions about how and where their data is being stored. There have not been any major cases of data collected by these traffic cameras ending up in third-party systems, they say, but there’s always the possibility that it could if companies and their public sector counterparts are not following the same standards for data storage.</p>
<p>The way we assess surveillance and privacy in the digital age is “under stress,” Weitzner said. Evolving technologies have made lawmakers have to constantly assess what data privacy rights look like at any given time. Supreme Court decisions, like <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_h315.pdf" target="_blank">Carpenter v. United States</a>, which refined what access to location data from cell phones is allowed without a search warrant, and <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/573/373/" target="_blank">Riley v. California</a>, which ruled that the warrantless search and seizure of the digital contents of a cell phone during an arrest is unconstitutional, shows how this field has evolved.</p>
<p>“What all this translates into is that digital information can be subject to a lot more uses and can be a lot more revealing than the kind of equivalent … analog information, or information that’s available on paper,” Weitzner said.</p>
<p>So, it may not be concerning to collect license plate data for speeding or traffic violations, but using that data across the board for any other purpose, for an unlimited amount of time, is a lot more sensitive, he added. And until Congress passes a standardization law for the industry, states will have to determine what works best for them, and what actions may be over the line.</p>
<p>“The underlying conundrum that we have is just that you can string together a lot of innocent, innocuous pieces of data,” Weitzner said. “And get something very valuable and very revealing.”</p>

(Photo Illustration by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the passage of a federal law earlier this year that calls for the owners of social media app TikTok to either sell it or be subject to a ban on the app in the U.S., Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares filed an </span><a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/d3e83e11901/50978a62-a01d-4d6b-9999-cd993cce9b55.pdf?rdr=true" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amicus brief</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Friday urging the Supreme Court to uphold the law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, sued the U.S. government over the law, saying it impeded their First Amendment rights, but a federal appeals court recently upheld the law. The high court will hear oral arguments in the appeal case Jan. 10.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_30211" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:300px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/21/virginia-joins-push-to-break-googles-search-monopoly/ga-2022-4-3/" rel="attachment wp-att-30211"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-30211 size-medium" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GA-2022-4-3.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Attorney General Jason Miyares (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Allowing TikTok to operate in the United States without severing its ties to the Chinese Communist Party exposes Americans to the undeniable risks of having their data accessed and exploited by the Chinese Communist Party,” Miyares, a Republican, said in a statement announcing the amicus brief. “The Supreme Court now has the chance to affirm Congress’s authority to protect Americans from foreign threats while ensuring that the First Amendment doesn’t become a tool to defend foreign adversaries’ exploitative practices.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the </span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&amp;r=1&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was introduced in March, members of Virginia’s congressional delegation supported it. Democratic U.S. Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Bobby Scott said the measure would protect Americans against foreign digital threats, while U.S. Sens. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, and Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who co-chair the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, supported the House’s action against TikTok. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In December 2023, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/eo/EO-24---Banning-the-Use-of-Certain-Applications-and-Websites-on-State-Government-Technology.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive order</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> banning the use of TikiTok “on any government-issued devices, including state-issued cell phones, laptops, or other devices capable of connecting to the internet except for public safety purposes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miyares co-led the amicus brief alongside Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen. Attorneys General in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Utah also signed on in support.</span></p>

However citizens of the commonwealth view Shenandoah County School Board’s recent decision, Virginia appears to be the first in the nation to restore Confederate school names, after years of vigorous community engagement, a controversial renaming process, and a change in board priorities related to race, diversity and inclusion. <strong><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/virginia-school-board-restores-confederate-names/">Read more.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>From the story:</strong> Of the roughly 2 million Virginians who’d been enrolled in Medicaid before the COVID-19 pandemic, over 480,000 of them have been disenrolled as of this August. Typically eligibility determinations are made annually, but they’d been on pause nationwide amid the pandemic due to federal policy. That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired. <em><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nearly-500000-virginians-in-medicaid-have-been-disenrolled/"><strong>Read more.</strong></a></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>From the column:</strong> Data centers are making the transition (to zero-carbon energy sources) harder, but so is local resistance to building solar. General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><b>Read more.</b></a></p>

Apartment rent has fallen in major metropolitan areas around the U.S. over the past six months according to findings from The Wall Street Journal.  (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)</p><p>A recent immigration surge brought newcomers to every state this year, helping to offset a continued drop in U.S. births while contributing to a national upswing of about 3.3 million new residents, according to new U.S. Census Bureau estimates.</p>
<p>Texas and Florida continued to dominate state population growth, together adding more than 1 million people from mid-2023 to mid-2024 and making up almost a third of the nation’s population increase. The state numbers include births, deaths, immigrants and residents moving from other states.</p>
<p>Nationally, this year’s population growth was up from the 2.8 million increase in 2023 and the 1.9 million boost in 2022, according to state population estimates released Thursday.</p>
<p>The population jump — the largest single-year increase since 2001 — was buoyed by a 21% increase in net immigration.</p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">Virginia saw a 0.9% increase in its population from July 2023 to July 2024, according to U.S.  Census Bureau figures, with 76,510 newcomers arriving in the commonwealth in that time.</p>
<p>Of that growth, 73.4% was due to immigration, with 56,155 migrants moving here over the same time period.</div>
	</div>
	
<p>Immigration has become a more significant factor in population changes, making up all or almost all the growth for 18 states in every part of the country this year, according to an analysis of the data by William Frey, a demographer for the Brookings Institution, a left-leaning think tank.</p>
<p>“This points up the importance of immigration, not just to a couple of big states but to a broad swath of our country,” Frey said. “It’s going to be very welcome in a lot of places that would not be gaining many people or [would be] losing people because of lower fertility and higher deaths.”</p>
<p>Immigration grew in every state, ranging from an increase of about 69,000 people in Florida and California and 57,000 in Texas, down to a few hundred in Montana and Wyoming. The growth in the immigrant population ranged from 19% in Alaska to 36% in Montana.</p>
<p>California and Illinois were among states that had lost residents earlier in the decade, and their growth over the past year could help both stem expected losses in congressional representation after the next nationwide census in 2030.</p>
<p>If the growth continues, it would trim California’s loss to three seats in the U.S. House of Representatives instead of four, and Illinois could lose one seat instead of two, said Kimball Brace, a Virginia-based redistricting expert.</p>
<p>Florida, where growth has slowed slightly, could gain one fewer congressional seat than predicted — three instead of four, he said.</p>
<p>“Clearly immigration is coming into play — a couple years ago you had people talking about California going off the deep end [with population loss] and now it doesn’t look so deep,” said Brace, president of political consulting firm Election Data Services Inc.</p>

<p>California ranked third in the number of new residents from July 1, 2023, to July 1, 2024, according to census estimates, with a gain of about 233,000, thanks to both immigration and people moving in from other states. The Golden State was followed by North Carolina (165,000) and New York (130,000). Illinois grew by about 68,000 and Louisiana by about 9,700.</p>
<p>Florida and Texas also were the leaders in percentage change, growing about 2% in that year, followed by Utah (1.8%), South Carolina and Nevada (both up 1.7%), and Idaho and North Carolina (both up 1.5%).</p>
<p>Only three states had population losses for the year, of a few hundred people each: West Virginia, Vermont and Mississippi.</p>

<p>In Texas, the cities of Houston, Austin and Dallas added the most new housing last year — almost 40,000 new units among them — and are likely to be the centers of new population growth, according to a <a href="https://www.demographics.texas.gov/Resources/TDC/Presentations/6d12aaac-2724-4c5e-861e-6bc84f200cfa/2023_EstimatesWebinar.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state report in November</a>. Collin County, a Dallas suburb, is also one of the state’s fastest growing areas, with more than 16,000 new housing units added last year and almost 64,000 since 2020, according to the report.</p>
<p>Florida’s recent growth was concentrated in Jacksonville, Port St. Lucie, Miami, Tampa and Orlando, according to a <a href="https://edr.state.fl.us/Content/population-demographics/reports/econographicnews_2024_Volume%201.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state report this year</a>.</p>
<p>A surplus of births over deaths helped most in New York, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.</p>
<p>New York City has built more housing, which helped stem net losses from people moving away, said Jan Vink, a senior extension associate at Cornell University’s Program on Applied Demographics.</p>
<p>That’s encouraging news for the state’s future, Vink said. In November, the <a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2024/11/stark-population-decline-projected-nys" target="_blank" rel="noopener">university estimated</a> that New York’s population could shrink by as much as 2 million people over the next 25 years because of low fertility rates and aging, unless those losses are offset by new arrivals in the form of immigration or people moving from other states.</p>
<p>Texas, the Carolinas, Florida and Tennessee had the largest numbers of new residents moving in from other states, though the numbers were down in all those states from the previous year as high interest rates and housing prices led more people to postpone moves.</p>

(Photo by Getty Images).</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate approved a broadly bipartisan bill early Saturday that would increase Social Security benefits for millions of Americans with pensions by ending two of the program’s policies in place for decades — the windfall elimination provision and government pension offset.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The legislation, which would cost more than $195 billion over 10 years, now goes to President Joe Biden for his signature. While he hasn’t released a public endorsement of the bill, extensive support in the House and Senate could signal he’s likely to support the measure becoming law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Senate vote was <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00338.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76-20</a> and the <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House vote</a> in November was 327-75.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins said during floor debate Wednesday that a fix for the two provisions has been decades in the making, noting she held the first hearing on the issue in the upper chamber in 2003.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Collins later partnered with the late California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein to introduce the first version of the bill in 2005, before working with former Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski in 2007 on another version.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Social Security is the foundation of retirement income for most Americans, yet many teachers, firefighters, police officers and other public servants often see their earned Social Security benefits unfairly reduced by two provisions,” Collins said. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The windfall elimination provision, she said, “affects public servants who receive a pension from a job not covered by Social Security, but who also worked long enough in another job to qualify for Social Security benefits.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The government pension offset affects people who worked in jobs that weren’t eligible for Social Security, but were eligible for a spousal benefit. That pension offset, Collins said, can reduce a spouse’s Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the non-covered pension, leading to 70% of those affected by the GPO to lose the entire Social Security benefit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This issue is extraordinarily important in my state of Maine because the state’s pension system does not include a Social Security component,” Collins said. “And among those most affected are Maine school teachers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Collins called the WEP and the GPO “an unfair, inequitable penalty.” </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Hit to trust fund</h4>
<p dir="ltr">North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said the bill’s title made it sound like “motherhood and apple pie,” but argued it wasn’t the right approach to address the problem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He expressed concern the bill would reduce the Social Security trust fund by an additional $200 billion during the next decade, moving up the insolvency date by six months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This chamber needs courage and needs to say what needs to be said — we are about to pass an unfunded $200 billion spending package for a trust fund that is likely to go insolvent over the next nine to ten years and we’re going to pretend like somebody else has to fix it,” Tillis said. “Well, when you’re a U.S. senator and you have your election certificate, that falls on us.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tillis said he agreed with Collins and others who support the bill that the WEP and the GPO must be fixed, but said that should be part of a larger conversation about addressing Social Security’s upcoming insolvency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We do not disagree with what we ultimately need to do,” Tillis said. “This is a disagreement in how to get here and how to have something that assesses the downstream risk. So it is with some trepidation that I come to the floor and criticize the good work of Sen. Collins. But I do it because there is so much riding on us getting this right and having the courage to fix Social Security over the next few years.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown said during floor debate Wednesday that people who paid into Social Security for the required amount of time should receive their full benefits. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“Social Security we know is a bedrock of our middle class — it’s retirement security that Americans pay into and earn over a lifetime,” Brown said. “You pay in for 40 quarters, you pay in essentially for 10 years. You’ve earned it. It should be there when you retire.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Brown said it “makes no sense” that workers in certain public service jobs, like teachers, police officers and firefighters, cannot draw their full benefits. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“They protect our communities, they teach our kids, they pay into Social Security just like everyone else,” Brown said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">How do these provisions work?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The pension offset reduces a “spousal or widow(er)’s benefits of most people who also receive pensions based on federal, state, or local government employment not covered by Social Security,” according to a <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The windfall elimination provision changes the formula to reduce Social Security benefits for people “who are also entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from jobs that were not covered by Social Security,” the report said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pension offset affects about 746,000 Americans while the windfall provision affects 2.1 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The share of Social Security beneficiaries affected by the GPO varies widely by state,” the CRS report says. “States with a relatively larger share of GPO-affected beneficiaries are usually those with a larger share of state and local government employees not covered by Social Security or those with more (Civil Service Retirement System) retirees.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The pension offset has a disproportionate impact on Social Security beneficiaries in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas and Utah. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The windfall elimination provision affects a larger percentage of residents in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington, Wyoming. </p>
<p dir="ltr">“Similar to the GPO, the share of Social Security beneficiaries affected by the WEP varies by state,” CRS wrote. “Typically, states that have a larger share of state and local government employees not covered by Social Security or more CSRS retirees have a relatively larger share of Social Security beneficiaries affected by the WEP.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Bipartisan House support</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The U.S. House <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voted 327-75</a> in November to approve the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/82/text?s=1&#038;r=1&#038;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22social+security+fairness+act%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four-page bill,</a> sponsored by Louisiana Republican Rep. Garret Graves and Virginia Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Graves said during <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/crec/2024/11/12/170/166/CREC-2024-11-12-house.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floor debate</a> that for 40 years, Social Security worked by “treating people differently, discriminating against a certain set of workers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These are police officers, teachers, firefighters, and other public servants,” Graves said at the time. “I worked side by side with these folks. They are not people who are overpaid. They are not people who are underworked.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Spanberger called the windfall elimination provision and the government pension offset “two misguided provisions that were added to the Social Security Act in 1983 (and) have denied Americans the retirement security they worked for and expected to receive.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“For more than 40 years, public servants have tirelessly implored their representatives in Congress to listen to their stories and to correct this glaring injustice,” Spanberger said. “Today, for the first time, Congress will vote on the Social Security Fairness Act, to repeal the WEP and the GPO, and to finally put an end to this theft.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Opposition to bill</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Missouri Republican Rep. Jason Smith, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said the two provisions affect around 4% of all Social Security beneficiaries, more than 60% of whom are concentrated in 10 states.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two provisions, he said, “were put in place more than four decades ago to prevent workers with earnings that were exempt from Social Security payroll taxes from getting more generous treatment from Social Security than workers who spent their whole careers contributing to Social Security.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Unfortunately, these policies still result in overly generous benefits for some while unfairly penalizing others,” Smith said, before arguing the bill wasn’t the right way to address the two provisions. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Smith said that getting rid of the two provisions “without a replacement potentially trades unfair treatment for preferential treatment.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He also expressed concern about how pulling more money from the Social Security trust fund would impact solvency. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60690" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> the bill would cost $195.65 billion during the next 10 years and wrote in a <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-11/60876-HR82.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a> to Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley that it would likely move up the Social Security insolvency date by six months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If H.R. 82 was enacted, the balance of the (Old-Age and Survivors Insurance) trust fund would, CBO projects, be exhausted roughly half a year earlier than it would be under current law,” CBO Director Phillip L. Swagel wrote. “The agency estimates that under current law, the balance of the OASI trust fund would be exhausted during fiscal year 2033.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Social Security<a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> trustees report</a> for 2024 says that the program will be able to pay full benefits until 2035. After that, if Congress hasn’t brokered a solution, Social Security would be able to pay about 83% of benefits. </p>

<p>“There are standards in every other industry,” she said. “Why not us?”</p>

Now, advocates are pushing for new statewide legislation that would ensure minimum wage and sick time and require written agreements between employers and workers.</p>
<p>“I know what it is to be unprotected and alone in this industry,” Dominguez said. “There’s no co-workers.”</p>

<p>If advocates are successful, Washington would join a dozen Democratic-leaning states and several cities that have added new protections for domestic workers. Efforts in those places did not face widespread opposition, though they raised some concerns about privacy and overregulation of workers in private homes.</p>
<p>In 2010, <a href="https://labornotes.org/2010/07/domestic-workers-new-york-win-first-ever-job-protections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York became the first state</a> to pass a Domestic Worker Bill of Rights, guaranteeing overtime pay, at least one day off per week and protections against racial and sexual harassment. Since then, 11 other states have passed similar laws, as have Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C., according to the National Domestic Workers Alliance.</p>
<p>Congress is unlikely to pass national standards anytime soon. President-elect Donald Trump has promised mass deportations of immigrants — who make up a disproportionate share of domestic workers — and he and the GOP-dominated Congress almost certainly would be cool to new regulations designed to protect them.</p>
<p>Federal labor laws for decades exempted domestic workers from many safeguards, including a minimum wage, civil rights protections and workplace safety standards. These exclusions were rooted in racism and sexism, said Zoë West, a senior researcher at The Worker Institute at Cornell University who has studied the industry and operated training programs to educate workers about their rights.</p>
<p>Historically, domestic work has largely been done by Black and immigrant women, West said, and that work — cleaning, child care and the like — has long been viewed as “women’s natural work.”</p>
<p>“There’s a very persistent, strong perception that this isn’t real work,” she said.</p>
<p>Some of the new state and local legislation has mandated that domestic workers are paid overtime and at least the state or city minimum wage, while other laws have gone further, ensuring protections such as paid time off.</p>
<p>But new laws are just the first step.</p>
<p>“[Y]ou still have this enforcement question,” West said. “Across all kinds of low-wage work — not just domestic work — there’s a lot of challenges in enforcing labor law.”</p>
<p>Many domestic workers are privately employed by families, making it difficult to educate both employers and workers about new protections. And domestic workers, who are sometimes paid cash without any formal work agreement, can be particularly vulnerable to retaliation.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, which approved new domestic worker protections in 2019, some workers who pushed employers to honor newly won rights such as lunch breaks or contracts were fired, said Aurora Munoz, the Pennsylvania organizing manager for the National Domestic Workers Alliance.</p>
<p>The organization has since launched an anti-retaliation campaign and is pushing the Philadelphia City Council to approve new legislation next year to prevent retaliation and beef up enforcement.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20240122095349/Policy-and-Compliance-Report-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philadelphia received six complaints </a>regarding domestic worker protections; five of those cases were closed. The city’s labor department could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>“If we enforce it to the T, then it will be really amazing and beneficial for not just domestic workers, but a lot of low-wage workers,” Munoz said.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘People are paying attention’</h4>

	</h4>
<p>For New Jersey state Sen. Britnee Timberlake, the story of domestic work is the story of her family.</p>
<p>Her grandmother worked as a so-called baby nurse and house cleaner. When she relocated to the Northeast from North Carolina, she found domestic jobs for other family members moving North.</p>
<p>Timberlake, a Democrat, sponsored legislation requiring meal breaks, protection from discrimination and the right to written contracts for domestic workers.</p>

<p>“One of my only regrets with the bill is that I did not name it after her,” she said of her grandmother. “This is something that is a part of my history and a part of my fabric.”</p>
<p>Timberlake said <a href="https://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bill-search/2022/S723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the legislation</a>, introduced in 2022 and enacted earlier this year, aligns with broader efforts to provide protections for workers who aren’t in unions.</p>
<p><a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/01/09/domestic-workers-celebrate-passage-of-bill-granting-them-new-labor-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business groups opposed the bill</a>, saying it would unfairly overburden employers, the New Jersey Monitor reported.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Business &amp; Industry Association pushed for some amendments that were added to the bill, including removal of a provision that would have mandated an extra hour of pay in situations where the employer cannot provide a meal or rest period. <a href="https://njbia.org/lame-duck-review-how-nj-business-fared/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a legislative update on the group’s website,</a> Vice President of Government Affairs Elissa Frank said the changes “successfully strike a balance between providing flexibility for employers to manage their workforce according to business needs and ensuring certain protections for employees.”</p>
<p>Now, Garden State advocates are working to ensure both workers and employers know about the new law, said Evelyn Saz, the lead New Jersey organizer with the National Domestic Workers Alliance.</p>
<p>Saz came into domestic work <a href="https://19thnews.org/2023/10/domestic-workers-health-safety-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after fleeing war</a> in her native El Salvador for the United States, where she struggled to find work because she did not speak English and had a foreign university degree.</p>
<p>“I took any opportunity I could as a single mother to support my family,” she wrote in an email to Stateline translated into English by a co-worker at her alliance. “This work can’t stop now. We need to make sure that domestic workers are fully informed about their rights and are able to enforce them.”</p>
<p>Traditional labor organizing focuses on a single geographic location: a hotel or factory with a broad group of workers and a single employer. But that’s not possible with domestic workers, said Ben Fuller-Googins, deputy director of Carroll Gardens Association, a neighborhood organization in Brooklyn that advocates for affordable housing, worker rights and other issues.</p>

<p>“You don’t know how many domestic workers there are, where they work,” he said. “There’s one employer per worker.”</p>
<p>That’s led his organization to aim to educate workers and employers across the entire Carroll Gardens neighborhood about the state’s protections for domestic workers.</p>
<p>“Our approach is that, generally, employers want to do the right thing but are not equipped with the resources and guidance they might need,” he said.</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Labor has conducted 840 investigations into potential violations of the law since 2010, when the law was enacted.</p>
<p>Kenya Williams, who’s been a nanny in New York for 26 years, said she was only recently informed of her rights when a member of the Carroll Gardens group approached her in a local park. Before that, she said, she generally took whatever pay and conditions were offered to her and didn’t know to ask about holiday or overtime pay.</p>
<p>“Things are slowly getting better,” she said. “I think we are making improvements in our industry and people are paying attention.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Is the home a workplace?</h4>

	</h4>
<p>By its nature, domestic work can be informal.</p>
<p>With no human resources department at hand, families will often ask friends what they pay their nannies or Google how to hire a housekeeper, said Stacy Kono, director of Hand in Hand, a national group representing employers of domestic workers.</p>
<p>“In many ways, the first barrier we often face is people don’t even realize they’re employers,” she said.</p>
<p>While some employers do not provide benefits or pay fair wages, Kono said many want to do the right thing for those who work in their homes.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen organized employer opposition to the efforts,” she said of the new laws. “It’s generally been employers supporting the efforts.</p>
<p>“We want to shift the mindset so that people do recognize domestic work as protected labor that is work like any other work, and for that reason, the home is a workplace.”</p>
<p>Whether private homes should be considered a workplace has been an ongoing debate in California.</p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2020 <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/SB-1257.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vetoed legislation</a> that would have required domestic employers to comply with occupational health and safety rules. In his veto message, the governor said he agreed with the sponsor’s intent.</p>
<p>“However, new laws in this area must recognize that the places where people live cannot be treated in the exact same manner as a traditional workplace or worksite from a regulatory perspective,” he wrote.</p>
<p>This September, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billHistoryClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1350" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newsom signed narrower legislation</a> extending safety standards for domestic workers employed by agencies.</p>
<p>“It isn’t everything we want. It doesn’t protect all of our base. But it is an important and historical step forward for California,” said Kimberly Alvarenga, director of the California Domestic Workers Coalition.</p>
<p>The University of California, Los Angeles estimates the state is home to more than <a href="https://losh.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/37/2020/06/Hidden-Work-Hidden-Pain.-Domestic-Workers-Report.-UCLA-LOSH-June-2020-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">350,000 domestic workers</a> employed in 2 million households. That includes an estimated 175,000 who work for agencies or services as opposed to private families, Alvarenga said.</p>
<p>California previously <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/DomesticWorkerBillOfRights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended overtime pay</a> to most domestic workers, but they still were not given the same health and safety protections as many other workers.</p>
<p>While the organization would like to see safety standards extended to all workers, Alvarenga said it’s currently focused on enforcement and education around the new law.</p>
<p>“This work is not being valued. It’s not being recognized,” she said. “They’re not asking for something special. They’re just asking for basic protections.”</p>

<p>But have you never wondered how he became a man of so many names? From St. Nick to Santa to Kris Kringle, it’s a marvel that Rudolph isn’t completely confused about whom exactly he is working for.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.valeriefridland.com/" target="_blank">as a linguist</a> who studies the social and historical paths that deliver the words we use, the season’s festive lights and boughs of holly inspired a deep dive into Santa’s past to uncover what name we should really be using for the man in red.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Ho, ho, ho</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>It might feel like he has been around as long as the North Pole, but the Santa Claus name so frequently mentioned by Americans to refer to old Saint Nicholas come Christmas Eve is a surprisingly recent moniker.</p>
<p>The first written citation for “Santa Claus” does not appear in the U.S. until the late 18th century, where it was alluded to in a mention of a religious event in the New York Gazette: “Last Monday the Anniversary of St. Nicholas, <a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/santa-claus_n" target="_blank">otherwise called St. A Claus</a>, was celebrated at Protestant-Hall.”</p>
<p>The fact that the first citation appeared in New York is not unusual, given New York’s history until 1664 <a href="https://www.nps.gov/mava/learn/historyculture/new-netherland.htm" target="_blank">as a Dutch colony</a> and the ongoing presence of Dutch settlers in that area. This Dutch background is key because Santa Claus is in fact <a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/santa-claus_n?tab=etymology" target="_blank">a borrowing into English of the Dutch </a>name Sinter Klaas, which sometimes dialectally appeared as Sante Klaas.</p>
<p>Still, before the 1830s, the substitution of Santa Claus for St. Nick was not in frequent use. In fact, prior to vastly increasing in general popularity toward the latter half of the 1800s, its use earlier that century was often to invoke Dutch heritage and culture, as in the <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/oa-edit/10.1201/9781315225340-37/contested-representation-dutch-americans-washington-irving-history-new-york-baga-budianta" target="_blank">satirical writings of Washington Irving</a>.</p>
<p>For instance, a <a href="https://archive.org/details/salmagundiorwhim00irvi/page/n9/mode/2up" target="_blank">New York-based satirical magazine</a> of the era had this to say in 1808: “The noted St. Nicholas, vulgarly called Santa claus − of all the saints in the kalendar the most venerated by true hollanders, and their unsophisticated descendants.”</p>
<p>But, by the 1820s, <a href="https://collections.library.yale.edu/catalog/2014510" target="_blank">a children’s book</a> introduced Sante Claus in a sleigh pulled by reindeer, suggesting that his modern reputation was established by then. His iconic attire, though, didn’t become his standard uniform until a <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/about-us/history/haddon-sundblom-and-the-coca-cola-santas" target="_blank">Coca-Cola advertisement</a> depicted him in red-suited splendor over a century later in 1930. Before then, Santa’s outfits had spanned the range from green and yellow to even <a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/life/holidays-and-celebrations/why-is-santa-claus-dressed-in-red" target="_blank">patriotic stars and stripes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Old Saint Nick</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>The popular term for Santa prior to this period was Saint Nicholas, a name known from the religious observance of the Feast Day of St. Nicholas on Dec. 6. <a href="https://theindoproject.org/celebrating-sinterklaas-part-of-our-dutch-culture/" target="_blank">The Dutch name, SinterKlaas</a>, is actually a derivative of the name Saint Nicholas.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Nicholas" target="_blank">the namesake of Saint Nicholas</a> was the highly charitable bishop of a Roman town called Myra during the fourth century. He had become the patron saint of children and was known as a man of great generosity. His background made him an easy candidate for later becoming associated with Christmas, even though he originally was celebrated on an entirely different day and for a different reason.</p>
<p>Whether going by St. Nick or Santa Claus, the man’s enormous celebrity as the grantor of tangible wishes also turned out to be another legacy of the Dutch, for it was their tradition <a href="https://www.stnicholascenter.org/around-the-world/customs/netherlands" target="_blank">to give small gifts or sweets</a> on St. Nicholas Day. And so, this Dutch tradition inspired the American mythologizing of a man with a sack of presents on his back to be delivered to children throughout the land.</p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Kringle wrinkle</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Another name for Santa Claus that grew in popularity in the 1800s was the name Kris Kringle. While Santa Claus was Dutch, Kris Kringle <a href="https://www.wordorigins.org/big-list-entries/kris-kringle" target="_blank">came by way of the Germans</a> who first settled in Pennsylvania and <a href="https://mki.wisc.edu/exhibits/virtual-exhibits-2/how-german-is-american-3/how-german-is-american-settling-in-america/#:%7E:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.,as%20America's%20%22German%20Belt.%22" target="_blank">then spread out</a>, particularly in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>The name Kris Kringle, though, was unrelated to Saint Nicholas. Instead, it came from the <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/Kriss%20Kringle" target="_blank">German word Christkindlein</a>, meaning “Christ child,” referring to the baby in the manger. So, unlike St. Nicholas, Kris Kringle is more directly related to the Christian celebration of Christ’s birth.</p>
<p>Over time, however, the feast of St. Nicholas, also celebrated by German immigrants, became increasingly merged with the celebration of Christmas in the U.S. Given the German influx into the United States was much greater than the Dutch during the 1800s, it is not surprising that the German name competed with the Dutch term during much of that period before Americans eventually decided to settle mainly on Santa Claus.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">A man of many names</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>In the end, whether it’s St. Nick, Santa or Kris Kringle who rides his sleigh into the holidays, the history of how he got his name is one that illustrates a wonderful melding of languages and cultures – a reminder of how differences can merge into a rich and varied part of a culture, celebrated by many.</p>

Biden on Monday commuted the sentences of 37 federal death row inmates. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">President Joe Biden commuted the sentences on Monday of 37 death row inmates, citing his conscience as a force behind the decision. He also left the death sentences unchanged for three men charged with hate-motivated mass shootings and terrorism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden, who imposed a moratorium on federal executions during his administration, commuted the death sentences to life sentences without the possibility of parole, saying in a statement that he’s dedicated his career “to reducing violent crime and ensuring a fair and effective justice system.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,” Biden said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Vice President, and now President, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The three men Biden left on death row Monday include Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, sentenced in 2015 of bombing the Boston Marathon in 2013; Dylann Roof, sentenced in 2017 of fatally shooting nine members of Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015 in Charleston, South Carolina; and Robert Bowers, sentenced in 2023 for the deadly shooting in 2018 that killed 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president’s commutations Monday come after he <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/biden-commutes-sentences-nearly-1500-people-pardons-39-historic-clemency-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commuted the sentences</a> on Dec. 12 of 1,500 people who were placed in home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic. He also granted pardons for 39 individuals convicted of nonviolent crimes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Biden received <a href="https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/shapiro-conahan-says-biden-commuting-kids-for-cash-judges-sentence-absolutely-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticism</a> from Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and others for including among the mass commutations a Pennsylvania judge convicted in 2011 of sending children to prison in exchange for millions of dollars in kickbacks from a private jail — a crime that became known in the commonwealth as the “<a href="https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/shapiro-conahan-says-biden-commuting-kids-for-cash-judges-sentence-absolutely-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cash for Kids</a>” scheme.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Advocates for abolishing the death penalty and some U.S. House Democrats had <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-dem-quartet-calls-biden-spare-lives-federal-death-row-inmates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pressured Biden</a> to commute death penalty sentences ahead of President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Trump expedited some executions during his first term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a statement, Trump transition spokesman Steven Cheung blasted the commutations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These are among the worst killers in the world and this abhorrent decision by Joe Biden is a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones,” Cheung wrote. “President Trump stands for the rule of law, which will return when he is back in the White House after he was elected with a massive mandate from the American people.”</p>

As President Joe Biden’s administration </span><a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-30921.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">backtracks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its efforts to maintain some protections for transgender students due to pending litigation, similar efforts in Virginia could be rolled back, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed rule — which would have required states to allow biological males who identify as female to compete in girls’ and women’s sports — is separate from an extended civil rights protections rule for LGBTQ students under Title IX, which is still being challenged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares called the withdrawal a “major victory” in a statement on Monday. Last year, he </span><a href="https://6rdh5iebb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001jvtWsOWktXoHSP5jkLp53sRncR-6Co9RDAN0u3JkFjolTeANSTc_esQPt0pWBfCJfi8kUy1XPaIOmDuTdxCYSMoLnIE4w1SinQjK4xgqdmhuLkepmb9JnoJebWBtbAv4kjM7hjTcZxWyd8z98pZOgPKvI9vGgEbaSSvo7bMm4f-mE7mNUyzRs6F9COtlPctd9MD0LBtPTWJ8pADp3jtoFHpPKtPrJRWSwIgzCTjWP8ZMSWrqy5-TyB5Yg7gshIn1rGTVql65zyH6g0h1NgP_E8kc2ToNkwKsK8dHGepfSPoUEtlh3Lk6U8gOh2pnJ1MfXuoAcdc6vHXEP4D2GGaqopH6F9vCvZbv2HtlonOyx1VCGLea3CzJpEqrXos1qrtLQXvaNukZ2FqZFQ14eANb8S6XgpdJwQP0&amp;c=uClvih1ISydmTc0WAlFY_XEIYaAuDa0l8s_kZJRdRFoOyjD-cYQUvg==&amp;ch=1nNdTwA10fWIw4_2uESac5akNGXVdqE1Uue_euaBr9NKvbFndb239g==" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">joined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a coalition of attorneys general to oppose the Biden administration’s attempt to make changes to TItle IX that aimed to protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proposed rule would have jeopardized the integrity of women’s sports, forcing female athletes to compete on an uneven playing field while uprooting decades of progress for women in sports. I’m proud to have stood up for Virginia’s female athletes and for the common-sense protections they deserve,” said Miyares in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the past four years, lawmakers and attorneys have sparred over transgender policies in Virginia, as the Biden administration and groups like the </span><a href="https://www.acluva.org/en/cases/doe-v-hanover-county-school-board#:~:text=On%20July%203%2C%202024%20ACLU,she%20tried%20out%20and%20qualified." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACLU of Virginia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have sought to maintain and expand safeguards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opponents of the rule said it would impose gender ideology on others with conservative views and potentially impact the safety of women and girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel and Vice President of Legal Strategy Jonathan Scruggs said female athletes deserve to compete on a “level playing field” and the presidential administration, through the Department of Education, has taken a step in the right direction with the withdrawal. ADF, a conservative Christian legal organization focused on protecting religious rights, has been active in cases seeking to prohibit transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The decision to withdraw the proposed sports rule merely reflects the views of the vast majority of Americans who </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/507023/say-birth-gender-dictate-sports-participation.aspx" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">believe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that women’s sports should remain reserved for female athletes,” Scruggs said in a statement, adding that ADF will continue to fight other Title IX measures.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Other efforts to ban transgender women athletes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bluefield University in Southwest Virginia, and other National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics member schools, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/naia-transgender-ban-ad422f3a86ebcc4db618750c6a5d1c5f" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transgender women from competing in women&#8217;s sports in April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other efforts to ban transgender women from sports in Virginia have been unsuccessful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this year’s General Assembly session, Democrats killed bills that would have essentially </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB723" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transgender students from competing in sports programs at elementary, middle and high schools as well as higher education institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In February, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration </span><a href="https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/government-politics/youngkin-administration-play-to-change-policy-for-transgender-high-school-athletes-falls-short-in-charlottesville/article_0ab1748c-c54c-11ee-9a8f-4745a6f30110.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to match the Virginia High School League’s policy on transgender athletes with its overhauled policies that students should be placed on teams based on their biological sex rather than their gender identity, but the attempt failed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia High School League, which oversees interscholastic athletic competition for Virginia’s public high schools, </span><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OxLAgeE0tBHCgcHBdYoMBDGepYL2fN7W/view" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for transgender athletes to participate on teams that match their gender identity, but under certain conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parents of a Hanover County transgender student were successful in challenging a school’s decision to ban their child from trying out for her school tennis team when a federal court judge temporarily allowed the student in August to try out for and, if selected, play on a sports team this school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But four months later, the parents of the student dropped the lawsuit against the school system because the student was no longer enrolled in the school division due to “ongoing harassment and concerns about her safety.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Trump presidency could usher in new era of challenges for trans student athletes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia, like all the states, is preparing for  Republican President-elect Donald Trump to take office next month. Trump promised that he would ban trans students from playing on school sports teams that align with their gender identity during his successful campaign for office against Vice President Kamala Harris. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rhetoric has left transgender youth </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-rights-trump-title-ix-1b9d3a1d928ea78c21372da63600c6d1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">seeking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help, the Associated Press reported, as Trump continues the calls to roll back protections for trans students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With the stroke of my pen on day one, we’re going to stop the transgender lunacy,” </span><a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/public-affairs-event/president-elect-trump-speaks-at-turning-point-action-conference-in-arizona/653788" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Trump at AmericaFest on Sunday, adding that “I will sign executive orders to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender out of the military and out of our elementary schools and middle schools and high schools.”</span></p>

(Gerville/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a truth universally acknowledged: a politician in possession of elected office must be in want of large economic development projects.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such is the power of this compulsion that it is proof against all reason. Certainly, it has been proof against everything critics of the data center buildout have said so far: that Virginia is catapulting itself into a costly energy crisis that will raise utility bills for residents; that the public shows no love for this industry; and that the benefits to be gained (mostly in the form of construction jobs) will continue only as long as new projects follow one another in perpetuity until the landscape is consumed by concrete and transmission wires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the credit of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC), however, it has tried to sound the alarm. JLARC’s </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt598-2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, “Data Centers in Virginia,” released December 9, describes the challenges facing the state as a result of the massive, ongoing buildout of this resource-intensive industry. Many of JLARC’s conclusions seem way too sanguine to me, especially around risks to regional water supplies and air pollution from diesel generators, and the policy options it offers don’t always hit the mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But on the threat to Virginia’s energy supply, JLARC is blunt: Building enough infrastructure to provide electricity for even just half the data centers projected for development across the state will be difficult, requiring far more generating facilities than are under development today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the current policy of allowing completely unconstrained data center growth – indeed, subsidizing it as we do now with tax exemptions to the tune of nearly a billion dollars per year – JLARC notes we are headed for a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/09/legislative-report-development-of-data-centers-could-triple-energy-demands-if-unconstrained/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tripling of the state’s electricity usage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over just the next decade and a half.  Meeting that much demand, says the report, would be “very difficult to achieve,” even if the state jettisoned the carbon emission limits imposed by the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those of you unfamiliar with the vocabulary of bureaucrats, “very difficult to achieve” is a term of art that translates roughly as, “This is nuts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might have been better if JLARC had employed the vernacular, because as it is, Virginia’s elected leaders will probably take “very difficult” to be a sort of heroic challenge, like beating the Russians to the moon, when what JLARC means is more like achieving lasting peace in the Middle East. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One problem is cost. The law of supply and demand dictates that a massive increase in energy demand that isn’t matched by an equally massive increase in energy supply will lead to higher prices for all customers. Yet new energy projects cost money, and under traditional ratemaking principles that also means higher rates for everyone. The result is that it will be impossible to protect residents from higher utility bills, unless changes are made to the way costs get allocated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Figuring out how to protect residents and other non-data center customers is currently a focus of the State Corporation Commission, which held a technical conference on data centers on December 16</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Judging by what the experts it convened had to say, the SCC has its work cut out for it.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if ordinary residents could be protected, the bigger problem is that increasing the supply of energy to keep up with soaring data center demand will not be easy, fast or cheap. JLARC warns that providing enough low-cost energy requires that gas plants, solar facilities, battery projects and transmission lines all be built at a pace Virginia has never achieved before, along with onshore wind farms that have never found takers here (though that may be </span><a href="https://virginiabusiness.com/big-tech-company-to-buy-power-from-va-s-first-onshore-wind-farm/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">changing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), offshore wind projects that currently lack a pathway to development, and starting ten years from now, new nuclear plants in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs) that haven’t yet achieved commercial viability.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="bC6aPdPSgo"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/02/data-centers-and-virginias-special-kind-of-denialism/">Data centers and Virginia’s special kind of denialism</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Data centers and Virginia’s special kind of denialism&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/02/data-centers-and-virginias-special-kind-of-denialism/embed/#?secret=nvV1Z3JuQf#?secret=bC6aPdPSgo" data-secret="bC6aPdPSgo" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the new generation and transmission will have to overcome local opposition. On the gas side, Dominion Energy’s plans for a new plant in Chesterfield County face </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/30/chesterfield-community-convenes-peoples-hearing-absent-a-county-held-one/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fierce resistance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the local community, which argues it has been burdened by fossil fuel pollution for too many years already. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean energy also struggles at the local level. Industry representatives told members of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR) on December 17 that more than 30 localities have effectively banned utility solar projects within their borders. Legislators are loath to override local government authority over permitting, even when counties that welcome data centers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/data-centers-approved-solar-farms-rejected-what-is-going-on-in-rural-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">turn down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the solar facilities needed to power them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course, these generation projects involve willing landowners. When it comes to transmission lines that are forced on property owners through eminent domain – many of which will be needed only to carry power to data centers – the public backlash may be brutal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given so much local resistance to new generation and transmission, the fact that so many legislators nonetheless remain wedded to the data center buildout testifies to the ability of the human mind to compartmentalize. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For legislators who care about climate, JLARC has more bad news: Fully half the new data center growth coming to Virginia is slated to occur in the territories of rural electric cooperatives, which are largely unaffected by VCEA limits. In addition, very large customers of Dominion and APCo have their own VCEA loophole: if they meet certain requirements, they can leave their utility to buy power from competitive service providers. Thus, if Virginia is serious about decarbonization, it will have to tighten, not loosen, the VCEA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report comes with some caveats. JLARC used a team of consultants to model approaches to meeting the supply gaps, and a lot of assumptions go into the </span><a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/presentations/JLARC%20Virginia%20Data%20Center%20Study_FINAL_12-09-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consultant’s report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> without a lot of details. The consultant group says it chose its mix of resources with a view to least cost, but it acknowledges that different assumptions would change the results. It may not have accounted for the fact that renewable energy and storage prices continue to drop; meanwhile, fossil gas</span><a href="https://rmi.org/the-myth-of-stable-and-affordable-natural-gas-prices/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> prices are so volatile </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that the one certain  thing you can say about any price forecast is that it will be wrong. Moreover, it appears the effects of re-entering the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative were not modeled; nor were the social costs of carbon, both of which favor zero-emission sources over fossil fuel plants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where there are details, some beg to be questioned. Both the consultants and JLARC take for granted that a shortage of generation in Virginia can be made up by importing electricity from other states. An easy way out, sure, but it works only if other states are producing a surplus. Unless tech companies are required to secure their own carbon-free energy supply, there is no way to guarantee imports will be available. Contrary to one of JLARC’s suggestions, then, retail choice should not be curtailed. The better move is to expand shopping options for large customers, so long as the electricity they buy is zero-carbon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more suspect is the idea that, in order to comply with the VCEA, all gas plants will convert to burning green hydrogen in 2045. The report might as well say, “and then a miracle occurs.” A miracle would be more likely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However unserious, hydrogen as a placeholder for any hoped-for technology that isn’t available today demonstrates the fundamental problem confronting Virginia’s damn-the-torpedoes approach to data centers. A refusal to put constraints on the buildout means taking a leap into the unknown and hoping something will happen to save us from the consequences of our profligacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And sure, maybe it will work out. Legislators tend to be optimists, and they are already betting on bright, shiny objects like SMRs, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/18/virginia-to-host-worlds-first-fusion-power-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fusion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and anything else not close enough for its costs and drawbacks to be fully evident. (Not that I’m immune, but personally I’m betting on </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/10/geothermal-energy-is-having-a-moment-could-it-power-virginias-data-centers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advanced geothermal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is not just bright and shiny but </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/geothermal/was-2024-a-breakout-year-for-next-generation-geothermal-energy?utm_campaign=canary&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PBgowoMiLVuB0gJvnCX8OnYRhNoz2UvuX652kq3S-jmEBgONlCzBP1Jp9a7hRErUG07g0KbCHTMz-ugwvauV_vGzK4ueJwmL6XDS0ZYvLfxlEzsA&amp;_hsmi=339495518&amp;utm_source=newsletter" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.) And hey, for all we know, artificial intelligence, the technology most culpable for today’s energy crisis, might even produce some unexpected new energy source.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or it might not. Given that most of the data center buildout will happen in just</span><a href="https://baxtel.com/news/will-2025-be-the-year-of-the-data-center-here-are-three-promising-facts-from-the-virginia-market" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the next five years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we might need an actual miracle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the flip side, maybe new technology will reduce the energy demand of data centers by </span><a href="https://cse.umn.edu/college/news/researchers-develop-state-art-device-make-artificial-intelligence-more-energy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">orders of magnitude</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That would be a fantastic outcome from the standpoint of climate, water and energy — though it would end the construction gravy train in Virginia and leave a wasteland of empty concrete warehouses and stranded energy infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, the unconstrained buildout of data centers has handed Virginia leaders a problem that is, in the parlance of JLARC, “very difficult” indeed.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://ethics.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Committee-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">42-page report</a>, the culmination of a years-long committee investigation, found that Gaetz, who denies the allegations, “regularly paid women for engaging in sexual activity with him,” used cocaine and ecstasy on multiple occasions between 2017 and 2019, accepted gifts including a 2018 trip to the Bahamas, and lied to the Department of State to obtain a passport for a woman he was sexually involved with and who he falsely claimed was his constituent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Representative Gaetz took advantage of the economic vulnerability of young women to lure them into sexual activity for which they received an average of a few hundred dollars after each encounter.

<p dir="ltr">“Several of those witnesses have also testified under oath before a federal grand jury and in a civil litigation,” the report continued.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Representative Gaetz denied the allegation but refused to testify under oath. He has publicly stated that Victim A ‘doesn’t exist’ and that he has not ‘had sex with a 17-year-old since I was 17.’ The Committee found that to be untrue and determined that there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz had sex with Victim A in July 2017, when she was 17 years old, and he was 35. Representative Gaetz’s actions were in violation of Florida’s statutory rape law,” according to the report.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz was chosen by Trump in November as his nominee to run the U.S. Department of Justice, even though Gaetz was previously the target of a department sex trafficking investigation that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-wont-charge-matt-gaetz-with-crimes-sex-trafficking-probe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/matt-gaetz-investigations-explainer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yielded</a> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/matt-gaetz-was-once-under-investigation-for-sex-trafficking-now-he-could-lead-the-justice-department" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charges</a>. Gaetz resigned from the House hours after Trump named him for the position.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After criticism from lawmakers and a spotlight on the House Ethics Committee’s probe, ongoing since April 2021, Gaetz <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/matt-gaetz-bows-out-trumps-pick-attorney-general" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bowed out</a> of the running for attorney general.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz continues to deny the allegations outlined in the committee report and sued the panel Monday. In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.275994/gov.uscourts.dcd.275994.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaint</a>, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Gaetz calls the committee’s decision to release the report “unconstitutional” because it does not have jurisdiction over a private citizen.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There is a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve-Eve report and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses,” Gaetz <a href="https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1871207714665197718" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X Monday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gaetz declined an opportunity to present his version of events to the committee, refusing an invitation to sit for a voluntary interview, the report said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Debate over release</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The committee wrestled with the decision to release the report, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-ethics-panel-republicans-vote-against-disclosure-gaetz-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocking</a> the decision after meeting on Nov. 20 before reversing course in a Dec. 10 vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Committee Chair Michael Guest said in a statement Monday that he opposed the report’s release.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I believe, have publicly stated, and remain steadfast in the position that the House Committee on Ethics lost jurisdiction to release to the public any substantive work product regarding Mr. Gaetz after his resignation from the House on November 14, 2024,” Guest, a Mississippi Republican, said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“While I do not challenge the Committee’s findings, I did not vote to support the release of the report and I take great exception that the majority deviated from the Committee’s well-established standards and voted to release a report on an individual no longer under the Committee’s jurisdiction, an action the Committee has not taken since 2006,” Guest’s statement continued.</p>

(Scott Yates for the Virginia Mercury)</p><p>Virginia’s booming data center industry is driving unprecedented energy demands, straining the state’s natural gas infrastructure and prompting calls for new pipelines. A Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) report warns that expanding pipeline capacity may be necessary to meet the surge, bringing with it additional logistical and environmental challenges.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some efforts to expand pipeline capacity are already underway. In October, Williams Companies filed an </span><a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20241029-5076&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for its Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP), which would add about 55 miles of pipeline — mostly in Southwest Virginia — to the existing 10,000-mile Transco Pipeline stretching from Texas to New York.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This follows the company’s </span><a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20231116-3071" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approval </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">last year for its Commonwealth Energy Connector Project in Southside, designed to link in Greensville County with the Columbia Gas Virginia Reliability Project. That initiative, now under </span><a href="https://www.whro.org/environment/2024-07-19/construction-begins-on-pipeline-expansion-in-hampton-roads#" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, will deliver natural gas to the Hampton Roads region, addressing growing energy needs in that part of the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southgate extension project, an effort to extend the Mountain Valley Pipeline from Pittsylvania County into North Carolina, began consultations with the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality this year for permit reviews.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, Balico, the Herndon-based developer previously associated with the canceled Atlantic Coast Pipeline, proposed a massive data center campus with 84 buildings and an on-site natural gas plant for power. However, strong community </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2024/11/04/data-center-proposal-in-pittsylvania-withdrawn-for-now/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opposition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> forced the company to scale back its plans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Atchie, director of community and project outreach for Williams Companies, emphasized the importance of the  SSEP, which seeks to expand natural gas infrastructure across Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It ensures that infrastructure exists to support the rapid economic and population growth in the southeast,” Atchie said, adding that it also meets the region&#8217;s growing demand for stable and reliable energy to heat homes and power essential services.”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent pipeline developments have drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups, who warn about the potential impact on waterways the projects may need to cross and the continued reliance on carbon-emitting fossil fuels. Scientists link these emissions to worsening climate change, including more frequent and intense storms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Basically, we&#8217;re looking at two co-located projects,” said Jessica Sims, a field coordinator for Appalachian Voices. “You have two projects, co-located in Pennsylvania County, approximately [that] could be built at the same time.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Southeast Supply Enhancement Project</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams Company plans to add about 55 miles of pipeline in Virginia and North Carolina through a series of loops —  parallel pipes designed to increase carrying capacity along existing lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the Eden Loop would include about 30.8 miles of 42 inch-diameter pipeline running from Pittsylvania County into Rockingham County, NC. The loop also includes two 33,000-horsepower electric-powered compressor stations, in addition to others in North Carolina.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41587" rel="attachment wp-att-41587"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41587" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project.jpg" alt="" width="1055" height="818" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project.jpg 1055w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project-300x233.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project-1024x794.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/SSEP-project-768x595.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1055px) 100vw, 1055px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams has requested approval for the project by February 2026, with an in-service date set for Nov. 1, 2027. Among the gas recipients are the City of Danville and Southwest Virginia Gas, which would take 1,500 and 5,000 dekatherms, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Without new capacity, there is a risk of repeating past shortages and power outages,” Atchie said. “The expansion taps into established pipeline corridors to minimize environmental and landowner impacts and will be built and maintained using Williams’ industry-leading safety standards, including 24/7 monitoring and rigorous maintenance.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Southgate extension</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SSEP pipeline is planned to follow a similar route  to the 31-mile Southgate Extension project, which Mountain Valley Pipeline announced last </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/01/02/mountain-valley-proposes-shrinking-southgate-extension/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it would be reviving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, the company has engaged with federal and state regulatory agencies, including the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), to discuss the permits required for the project’s revised scope, spokesperson Shawn Day said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Sims of Appalachian Voices raised concerns during a State Water Control Board meeting last month about Virginia code provisions that allow the DEQ to waive the requirement for a Section 401 permit under the federal Clean Water Act if the pipeline is below 36 inches. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37341" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/26/the-feds-extended-the-deadline-for-the-southgate-pipeline-extension-heres-a-refresher/mountain-valley-pipeline-6/" rel="attachment wp-att-37341"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37341" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MVP_pipes_SPY-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Mountain Valley Pipeline right of way and some piping is visible beside Rt. 460 Sunday, July 16, 2023, in Elliston. (Scott P. Yates for the Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The revised plans reduced the Southgate pipeline from 75 to 31 miles, eliminating the need for a  controversial compressor station, but increased the pipeline diameter from 24 and 16 inches to 30 inches, still under the threshold allowing the DEQ to waive the need for a water permit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The cumulative impacts from two major construction projects is one reason to give South gain more scrutiny than last time,” Sims told the board, pointing to its proximity to the SSEP project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked by the Mercury if the DEQ would waive any permits for the Southgate Extension project, DEQ spokesman John Giese said the agency has not received formal plans. “Southgate/Equitrans has informed [the] DEQ of their intent to move forward on a project and has discussed their general layout and timing of design,” Giese said. “However, no formal plans or permit application(s) have been submitted to [the] DEQ for review.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is aiming to be operational by 2028, “to provide PSNC Energy and Duke Energy with an affordable, reliable and resilient natural gas supply to meet residential and business demand and generate electricity,” MVP Southgate spokesman Day said, adding the project &#8220;will secure all necessary permits and authorizations.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Balico’s data center</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The JLARC report highlighted natural gas as the most viable option for onsite power generation, a necessity for many large-scale projects in Southwest Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Of the current technologies available, only natural gas appears viable for on-site generation, and it can be deployed only close to pipeline infrastructure that has sufficient capacity to serve generation needs,” the report stated.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41586" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1313px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41586" rel="attachment wp-att-41586"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41586" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center.jpg" alt="" width="1313" height="854" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center.jpg 1313w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center-300x195.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Balico-data-center-768x500.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1313px) 100vw, 1313px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A engineering plan for the data center campus and onsite power generation source. (Courtesy of Pittsylvania County)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pittsylvania County, Balico initially proposed a 2,300-acre data center campus with a 3,500-megawatt natural gas plant, but withdrew the plan after significant community pushback. In November, the company submitted a scaled down </span><a href="https://www.pittsylvaniacountyva.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/5911/638678889658570000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">application</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for a project requiring “more than 760 acres” and </span><a href="https://www.pittsylvaniacountyva.gov/government/departments/upcoming-zoning-special-use-permit-applications/-folder-407" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rezoning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> land for “private electric power generation,” with a letter of intent from Mountain Valley Pipeline owner, EQT, “for the supply of a sufficient volume of natural gas to fuel the power plant proposed for the campus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal is expected to be reviewed next year. Nearby, the town of Hurt passed a </span><a href="https://www.chathamstartribune.com/news/local/article_df6b1e6c-b26d-11ef-9744-4f2fedf60454.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> supporting the project, agreeing to provide 2 million gallons of water per day through the construction of  a new water plant. Community opposition to the original proposal had largely centered on the water demands of the project.</span></p>

(Roger Chesley/Virginia Mercury)
</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aunt Louise holds a special place of honor on my Christmas card list this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s the last living aunt or uncle, for that matter — following the deaths of several family elders since the start of 2023. Aunt Lou is the Washington football franchise’s biggest fan, and the 96-year-old has the Commanders’ paraphernalia and knowledge of pigskin strategy to prove it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We snail mail cards to the homes of 90 relatives, longtime friends and journalism colleagues annually, sometimes with updates on the expanding careers of our adult children. Email missives and impersonal text chains just won’t do the trick for The Boss and me.</span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2012/10/13/a-holiday-card-truly-from-the-heart-requires-paper-postage/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Mailing cards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, even with the ever-rising costs of stamps, has been a pleasant, longstanding ritual for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Christmas card list also represents an evolving microcosm of our lives and relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatives and friends who are now widowed dot the lineup. We acknowledge the deceased by supporting those still living and adapting to loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other spots, divorces mean we send out cards to different addresses where one previously sufficed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adult nieces and nephews — we have a bunch — now receive their own cards. Before, they were lumped in with their parents. How did one-time youngsters get so old, anyway?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve become more respectful of folks who aren’t Christian, be they Jews, Muslims, from other faiths or no faith at all. They get cards touting “Happy Holidays” and notes wishing them well in the season. I’m far from offended by this inclusive practice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families with new children crop up on the list occasionally. That’s a rarity, though, since The Boss and I have attained AARP status.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So consider this my special card to all of you, even if it doesn’t arrive in your mailbox: Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. May you have health, happiness and peace.</span></p>

Mike Johnson, R-La., speaks to members of the press at the U.S. Capitol on Dec. 20, 2024 in Washington, D.C.  (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Congress finally approved a stopgap spending bill&nbsp;early Saturday that will keep the government open for a few more months, after a raucous 48 hours that served as a preview of what President-elect Donald Trump’s second term in office might look like.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The short-term spending package, the third version of a bill to be released this week, will give lawmakers until mid-March to negotiate agreement on the dozen full-year government funding measures and provide about $100 billion in natural disaster assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although it technically was passed by the Senate after the midnight deadline for a shutdown, deputy White House press secretary Emilie Simons <a href="https://x.com/EmilieSimons46/status/1870332808813764703" target="_blank">said on X </a>that agencies would continue normal operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The House passed the bill Friday evening following a&nbsp;<a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024517" target="_blank">366-34 vote</a> with one Democrat voting “present.” The Senate voted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1182/vote_118_2_00339.htm" target="_blank">85-11</a> shortly after midnight Saturday. President Joe Biden signed the bill Saturday morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The legislation did not include any language either raising or suspending the debt limit, rejecting a demand by Trump that it be addressed. Congress and Trump will have to deal with that next year when they control the House, Senate and the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20241216/ARA%2012.20.pdf" target="_blank">118-page bill&nbsp;</a>will extend programs in the five-year farm bill through September, giving the House and Senate more time to broker a deal, even though they are already more than a year late.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The package would not block members of Congress from their first cost-of-living salary adjustment since January 2009, boosting lawmakers’ pay next year from $174,000 to a maximum of $180,600.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It does not include a provision considered earlier this week that would have allowed the year-round sale of E15 blended gasoline nationwide in what would have been a win for corn growers and biofuels.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The White House announced during the House vote that Biden supports the legislation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“While it does not include everything we sought, it includes disaster relief that the President requested for the communities recovering from the storm, eliminates the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires, and would ensure that the government can continue to operate at full capacity,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wrote. “President Biden supports moving this legislation forward and ensuring that the vital services the government provides for hardworking Americans – from issuing Social Security checks to processing benefits for veterans &#8212; can continue as well as to grant assistance for communities that were impacted by devastating hurricanes.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Appropriators at odds</h4>
<p dir="ltr">House Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., urged support for the bill during floor debate, saying it would avoid a partial government shutdown, provide disaster aid and send economic assistance to farmers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Governing by continuing resolution is never ideal, but Congress has a responsibility to keep the government open and operating for the American people,” Cole said. “The alternative, a government shutdown, would be devastating to our national defense and for our constituents and would be a grave mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Connecticut Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro, ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, spoke against the bill and criticized GOP negotiators from walking away from the original, bipartisan version released Tuesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">She rejected billionaire Elon Musk, a close Trump ally, seemingly calling the shots as if he were an elected lawmaker, though she ultimately voted for passage.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The United States Congress has been thrown into pandemonium,” DeLauro said. “It leads you to the question of who is in charge?”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Trump, Musk objections</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Democrats and Republicans reached<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/huge-spending-bill-unveiled-congress-provides-more-100-billion-disaster-aid" target="_blank"> an agreement earlier this week</a> to fund the government, provide disaster aid, extend the agriculture and nutrition programs in the farm bill, extend various health care programs and complete dozens of other items. But Trump intervened, preventing House GOP leaders from putting that bill on the floor for an up-or-down vote.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump and Musk&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/chances-government-shutdown-escalate-after-trump-and-gop-reject-stopgap-spending-bill" target="_blank">were unsupportive of some of the extraneous provisions in the original bill&nbsp;</a>and Trump began pressing for lawmakers to address the debt limit now rather than during his second term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">House Republicans&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-torpedoes-new-spending-plan-government-shutdown-nears-friday-night" target="_blank">tried to pass their first GOP-only stopgap bill&nbsp;</a>on Thursday night, but failed following a 174-235 vote, with 38 GOP lawmakers voting against the bill. That bill included a two-year debt limit suspension, but that was dropped from the version passed Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Friday before the vote that the GOP was united on its plan forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We have a unified Republican Conference. There is a unanimous agreement in the room that we need to move forward,” Johnson said following a 90-minute closed-door meeting. “I expect that we will be proceeding forward. We will not have a government shutdown. And we will meet our obligations for our farmers, for the disaster victims all over the country, and for marking sure the military and essential services and everyone who relies on the federal government for a paycheck is paid over the holidays.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">A total of 34 House Republicans voted against the bill. No House Democrats voted against passage.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">No shutdown, for now</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The House and Senate not agreeing on some sort of stopgap spending bill before the Friday midnight deadline would have led to a funding lapse that would likely have led to a partial government shutdown just as the holidays begin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">During a shutdown, essential government functions that cover the protection of life and property continue, though no federal workers would have received their paychecks until after the shutdown ends. That loss of income would have extended to U.S. troops as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If there is going to be a shutdown of government, let it begin now, under the Biden Administration, not after January 20th, under “TRUMP,” the president-elect posted on social media Friday morning. “This is a Biden problem to solve, but if Republicans can help solve it, they will!”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a separate post that went up just after 1 a.m. Eastern, Trump doubled down on his insistence that any short-term spending bill suspend the debt limit for another four years or eliminate the borrowing ceiling entirely.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Congress must get rid of, or extend out to, perhaps, 2029, the ridiculous Debt Ceiling,” Trump wrote. “Without this, we should never make a deal. Remember, the pressure is on whoever is President.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clarissa McGhee, a janitor at the Marshall Plaza municipal building, says she intermittently uses a cane due to arthritis but has never let it interfere with her work — until she allegedly stopped receiving shifts. According to McGhee, Nu-Tech manager Russell Dandridge told her, “don’t come with a cane.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My heart just dropped,” McGhee said in a phone interview with The Mercury. “I’m like, what does my cane have to do with me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGhee described her cane as a necessary aid she occasionally relies on but insisted that it doesn’t hinder her ability to perform her job. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a part of me,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By early November,Nu-Tech instructed McGhee to clock out of a shift and return with a doctor’s note. After obtaining the note, McGhee brought it to the company the following week but was still sent home and allegedly told that her cane was “a liability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGhee has since filed a </span><a href="https://www.seiu32bj.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/12-17-2024-McGhee-EEOC-Complaint.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">complaint </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, citing violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act. She also joined her colleague, Sharonda Smith, in a separate complaint filed with the National Labor Relations Board alleging retaliation for union activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith said that the two women had posted a flier to generate interest in forming a union. Shortly after, she was informed in November that her position had been terminated in November — a move she believes was linked to her union involvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Service Employees International Union’s regional chapter filed the </span><a href="https://www.seiu32bj.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/12-18-2024-Nu-Tech-ULP.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">labor complaint</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on their behalf and </span><a href="https://x.com/32BJSEIU/status/1869828304141988121" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">the action during a rally outside Richmond City Hall on Thursday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the rally, Smith shared her struggles since losing her job. A diabetic, she expressed concern about affording medical supplies not fully covered by Medicare and about keeping a roof over her family’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I expect to get eviction notices from the hotel where my family and I live because we can’t afford anything else,” Smith said. “I have to go to charities and food banks, but I shouldn’t have to do this because I enjoyed my job and I want work!”</span></p>

(Pixabay/Creative Commons license)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers are preparing to reintroduce bipartisan legislation aimed at creating a regulated and taxed adult-use cannabis marketplace in the state. The renewed push comes after Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a similar proposal earlier this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Paul Krizek, D-Fairfax, and Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach, are once again spearheading the effort, planning to bring forward the same proposal that previously passed both chambers of the General Assembly with bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB448" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as sent to Youngkin’s desk at the time, would establish a legal framework to regulate the sale and taxation of cannabis for adults 21 and older, marking a significant step toward implementing the retail market many advocates have long championed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re trying to start with the same bill since we were able to get both chambers aboard, including a couple Republicans. I think there’s a good chance that a few more Republicans will join in this time, especially in the Senate,” Krizek said in a phone interview earlier this week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While several GOP lawmakers supported the proposal at various points as it moved through the legislature during the 2024 session, only Sen. Christie New Craig, R-Chesapeake, voted for the bill’s final version in the state Senate. In the House, freshman Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery County, a former assistant attorney general, was the sole Republican to back the measure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia was the first southern state to legalize public possession of up to one ounce of marijuana by adults 21 and over and allow them to grow up to four plants of marijuana in a private residence. However, the General Assembly has yet to create a framework for a legal marketplace for cannabis products in the commonwealth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without a legal market in place, residents can grow small amounts at home or possess cannabis, but buying or selling it remains illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the proposed plan, the state would license cannabis retailers, establish clear rules for production and sales, and tax products to generate new revenue. Lawmakers argue that a regulated market would also curtail illegal cannabis sales and provide consumer protections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, the General Assembly approved a version of the bill that would have established a market, only for Youngkin to veto the legislation, citing concerns over enforcement and the state’s role in managing cannabis commerce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The proposed legalization of retail marijuana in the commonwealth endangers Virginians’ health and safety,” </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/101RteYQu09LrjbzzSqiFu9EIxyw7jMcCEnRvwRap-NA/edit?tab=t.0" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">he said in a statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“States following this path have seen adverse effects on children’s and adolescent’s health and safety, increased gang activity and violent crime, significant deterioration in mental health, decreased road safety, and significant costs associated with retail marijuana that far exceed tax revenue.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin has since repeatedly expressed skepticism about expanding legal cannabis in Virginia, and his spokesman Christian Martinez said on Wednesday that this hasn’t changed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Krizek remains hopeful that in his final year as governor, Youngkin may be open to negotiating with Democrats as he looks to solidify his legacy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t get into his head, obviously, but I think it’s for that reason it’s worth trying, it’s worth putting this out as an opportunity for a compromise in some other capacity,” Krizek said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”I think it&#8217;s very possible, because he’s already a lame duck and this is it for him, and if he wants to have one of his legacies be an unregulated cannabis free-for-all, then that will be his legacy. Or he could choose a rational marketplace with safe, tested and taxed products.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.roanoke.edu/documents/rcpoll/RC%20Poll%20Topline%20Feb2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A poll</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College and released during the legislative debate found that 63% of Virginians strongly or somewhat support measures to help small businesses compete with pharmaceutical companies and existing medical cannabis dispensaries, while only 15% are somewhat or strongly opposed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And advocates believe there is growing momentum to push the legislation forward again. Supporters highlight the potential for tax revenue, job creation, and investments in addiction treatment and restorative justice programs funded by cannabis taxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Habeeb, a former Republican member of the House of Delegates from Salem and a lobbyist for the Virginia Cannabis Association who helped draft Rouse’s bill earlier this year, said in an interview Thursday that Youngkin’s veto of the legislation caused an explosion of illegal corner marijuana stores, pop up shops and street dealers across the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Everybody who was trying to engage in this market in a proper way, some of the people selling hemp products, some of the people selling CPD products, they’ve almost all been wiped out of business,” Habeeb said. “That’s exactly what we said would happen if the government vetoed the bill to the extent there was a legally operating market in which this is essentially destroyed, and yet every day there are stories about raids and busts and illegal stores.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually Virginia is “going to have to wake up and create a regulated system, so we can get rid of these illegal stores and get this stuff out of the hands of our dealers and kids,” Habeeb said, adding that Republicans will continue to say its  Democrats fault for legalizing cannabis in the first place, and both Democrats and Republicans will continue to blame each other for the status quo, if it remains unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How that plays out for their individual legacies will have to be seen, but collectively creating a system where it’s legal to possess, legal to share, legal to grow, but illegal to sell in a regulated way, has created this system. It is completely unacceptable and I think history will tell us that it was a disaster.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The discussion around creating a legal marketplace for adult-use cannabis in Virginia is reignited as the Virginia Cannabis Control Authority (CCA) — the state agency created in 2021 to oversee the regulation and enforcement of cannabis laws in Virginia — unveiled its </span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/664229cd06b6f9326d1e815c/t/675708223e9a06386996e75e/1733756963828/2024-Virginia-Statewide-Impaired-Driving-Survey-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">latest survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on marijuana-impaired driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between August and September, the CCA surveyed 783 Virginia residents aged 16 or older with a driver’s license, including 310 who identified as past three-month marijuana users. The results, which build on the inaugural 2022 study, were released as part of National Impaired Driving Prevention Month this December.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The survey revealed nearly one-third of Virginia drivers believe those who consume marijuana are typically safe drivers. Furthermore, 22% of respondents admitted to driving while high a few times a year or more, and 34% acknowledged riding as passengers with drivers under the influence of marijuana. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-six percent of marijuana users reported they do not always plan for a sober ride home. These figures remain unchanged or have increased since the 2022 survey, underscoring the need for continued education and awareness campaigns, the CCA said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite these concerns, the survey also pointed to progress. The percentage of drivers who believe they are likely to be pulled over for driving under the influence of marijuana increased to 29%, up from 24% in 2022. Additionally, 47% of marijuana users said they always plan for a sober ride home, up from 42% last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This survey shows that while we’ve made some progress, there’s still considerable work to do,” said Jeremy Preiss, acting Head and Chief Officer of Regulatory, Policy, and External Affairs at the CCA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving under the influence of marijuana is illegal in Virginia. State law prohibits using cannabis while driving or as a passenger in a vehicle. Violations can result in fines, license suspension, or even jail time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the survey still found that 1 in 10 Virginia drivers (9%) incorrectly assume that there is no penalty for driving under the influence of marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite enforcement concerns and Youngkin’s previous resistance, Krizek and Rouse — who is seeking his party’s nomination for lieutenant governor in 2025 — remain optimistic that a renewed effort can succeed, especially with continued bipartisan backing and public support for a regulated market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their proposal is expected to be introduced when the General Assembly reconvenes in January. It will likely reignite debate over cannabis reform in Virginia, as lawmakers weigh economic benefits, public health concerns, and the political landscape leading up to the 2025 gubernatorial elections.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’d never say never, but I also realize that the governor has been pretty adamantly against the bill,” Krizek said. “I still think we have to do it, it would be legislative malpractice to not give it another try.” </span></p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the less noticed features of the Virginia Way is the long-running tendency of the commonwealth’s leaders to conduct their decision-making behind closed doors. While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the sudden resignation of University of Virginia basketball coach Tony Bennett in October, Lee Enterprises sports editor Matthew Kiewiet filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request seeking details about the matter. The university failed to fulfill the request until Dec. 18 — 40 business days after it was filed, a clear violation of state FOIA laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia law, public institutions must respond to FOIA requests within five business days, with an option to extend by seven additional business days if necessary. If a request is denied, institutions are required to cite specific state code exemptions and describe the withheld materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kiewiet, sports editor for Lee Enterprises, which owns the Richmond Times-Dispatch, had requested correspondence between Bennett and the university concerning a memorandum of understanding that had previously been described as a “signed contract.” Bennett, who led the Cavaliers for 15 seasons, including their 2019 National Championship win, announced his immediate departure in October.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now reviewing the records he finally received, Kiewiet described UVa’s FOIA process as “obnoxiously tedious.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe some folks have had better luck than me, but I haven’t heard glowing reviews from others,” he told The Mercury &#8220;They charge astronomical prices, which I am aware is legal, for their public records, and in this instance they didn’t seem especially eager to hand over what I requested.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The university waived the fees for Kiewiet’s request, a gesture he dismissed as inconsequential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">”Whoopty doo,” he said.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Former Culpeper Sheriff Scott Jenkins convicted in federal bribery scheme</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Jenkins, a former Culpeper, has been convicted on federal bribery and fraud charges after being accused of deputizing wealthy civilians who paid tens of thousands of dollars for badges. Key testimony in the case came from Jenkins’ former aide, Kevin Rychlik, who alerted the FBI to  the scheme and secretly recorded hours of conversations that became a cornerstone of the prosecution’s case. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the trial, Rychlik testified that in 2011 he gave Jenkins a $5,000 donation in exchange for an auxiliary deputy badge, </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/investigations/culpeper-ex-sheriffs-longtime-aide-testifies-against-him/3794176/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBC 4 reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The badge granted him the same rights as a sworn deputy. Rychlik also told the jury that he later became a campaign fundraiser for Jenkins and witnessed money and badges exchanged with others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After being investigated for unpaid taxes, Rychlik became an FBI informant and tipped off authorities about Jenkins’ scheme. Prosecutors revealed that Rychlik recorded meetings with Jenkins as part of the investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments to Jenkins reportedly ranged from $5,000 to $25,000, with funds going to Jenkins’ re-election campaigns or being pocketed personally, according to </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/12/18/scott-jenkins-convicted-culpeper-sheriff/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenkins is scheduled to be sentenced  in March of next year. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">King George Board of Supervisors wants to ‘eliminate restrictions’ on meetings</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The King George Board of Supervisors is asking the General Assembly to revisit state laws governing public meeting requirements, aiming to ease restrictions on how members can convene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a recent meeting, the board </span><a href="https://www.kinggeorgecountyva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/14412/121724--KGCBOS-Legislative-Summary-Resolution" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> legislative priorities for the state government, including a request to “eliminate restrictions on the Board of Supervisors’ meeting capabilities,” </span><a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-153269168" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FXBG Advance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reported. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Virginia law, any gathering of three or more members to discuss government matters must be advertised as a public meeting, with details on how the public can attend. This applies to both in-person and electronic meetings, such as those held over Zoom. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a 2004 </span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/foi-opinions/beck" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Supreme Court decision</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ruled that email exchanges between members do not constitute a public meeting, provided the communications are not simultaneous. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you experienced local or state officials denying or delaying your FOIA request? Tell us about it: </span></i><a href="mailto:info@virginiamercury.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">info@virginiamercury.com</span></i></a></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> This story was corrected on Dec. 23 to reflect that the King George Board of Supervisors, not Prince George, wants to eliminate restrictions on meetings.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is pitching a tax cut, and cites a hefty state budgetary surplus as justification. But surpluses can evaporate in a Mar-a-Largo minute, and the prospects of declining revenue flowing to Virginia because of cutbacks in federal employment and reductions in Medicaid reimbursements are making Virginia budget makers skittish about the future. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">We have seen the &#8216;Swamp&#8217;– and &#8216;they&#8217; is us</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has stated his desire to fundamentally change the federal bureaucracy by eliminating civil servants either deemed expendable or who do not exhibit sufficient loyalty to the president. He could start by reinstituting</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/us/politics/trump-biden-schedule-f.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Schedule F</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an executive order issued late in his first term (and rescinded by President Joe Biden) to strip job protections from many career federal employees and make them more like political appointees who can be fired at will. This would devastate the Commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More </span><a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/data-analysis-documentation/federal-employment-reports/reports-publications/federal-civilian-employment/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal workers live here than in any other state</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; 85,000 live in Northern Virginia and another </span><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU51472609091000001SA" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">60,000 make Hampton Roads</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> their home. Many earn a good salary and cuts in their positions would mean losing state revenue that comes both from their income taxes and the sales taxes generated from their purchases. Remember sequestration, when Virginia took a disproportionate hit from cuts in federal spending? Or the various government shutdowns? When the federal government sneezes, Virginia catches a cold.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Substantial cuts in federal employment might not dramatically affect the state budget until Youngkin has left office, but budget writers are justifiably concerned about future revenue shortfalls, thereby making any major tax cut problematic. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Medicaid dilemma</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Trump’s attack on federal employees may garner the largest headlines, his plans for cutting Medicaid pose more serious fiscal challenges for the states. Since 1965, Medicaid has been the largest source of medical and health care funding for poor and disabled Americans, providing free health insurance to over 80 million people, many of whom are children. It is administered by the states, but major program funding is provided by the federal government. For every dollar a state spends on Medicaid, Washington provides a match to cover the costs.

For poorer states like Mississippi and Alabama, the match is over 70%. Yearly federal spending on Medicaid exceeds $880 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big changes in the program have occurred since passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, which initially required states to expand Medicaid to people with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level (which today equals </span><a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/7240229f28375f54435c5b83a3764cd1/detailed-guidelines-2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about $35,600 for a family of 3</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court </span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2012.0766" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made this optional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but since the ACA required the federal government to pick up 100% of the state costs for the expansion population (gradually declining to 90%), many states concluded that expansion was a great way to provide insurance to those who could not afford it. </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forty-one states plus D.C.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eventually embraced the plan. Virginia joined in 2019, and its expansion population now numbers 758,000 of the 1,872,000 state residents in the program. Today, </span><a href="https://ihodvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/agenda_block_docs/attaches/000/001/025/original/FINAL__Medicaid_Forecast_Presentation_11-19-24.pdf?1732028008" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid covers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> almost 13% of the state’s population, and it is the second largest expenditure in the state budget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia budget writers were recently informed that there is a $632 million Medicaid shortfall that will require addressing in the next Assembly session. While that may be enough to throw a monkey wrench into the Governor’s plan for a tax cut, it is potentially only the tip of the iceberg.  Reducing Medicaid funding has been the target of conservatives for decades, and, with Republicans in control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress, a serious effort likely will be made to make cuts. The Heritage Foundation’s</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24088042-project-2025s-mandate-for-leadership-the-conservative-promise" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Project 2025 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Republican Study Committee’s</span><a href="https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_budget_including_letter_word_doc-final_as_of_march_25.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> budget plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the FY 2025 House budget</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/118th-congress/house-report/568/1?outputFormat=pdf&amp;s=1&amp;r=4&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22HCR+117%22%7D" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> resolution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all propose Medicaid cuts, including the reduction of the federal match for the expansion population. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican proposals to reduce the match rate would be a budgetary disaster for all states, including Virginia.  Ironically, many of the states who voted for Trump would take the largest hit because their federal match is so high.  In Virginia, a reduction in the match for the expansion population to 50% reimbursement would mean </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">$3 billion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> less per year for our budget, making the present shortfall mild by comparison. The commonwealth would either need to find additional funds to fill the gap, or dramatically cut services to those most in need.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it gets worse. Buried in the 2018 Virginia Medicaid expansion authorization is language that requires the state to</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unwind expansion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if the federal match falls below 90%. Eight other states  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Utah) have similar </span><a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-expansion-is-a-red-and-blue-state-issue/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">laws</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that require termination of expansion if the share of federal funding drops.  This would create a bureaucratic nightmare and remove 758,000 recipients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This places Youngkin in a serious quandary.  Many of the people in the reddest counties in Virginia who voted for both him and Trump would likely be seriously harmed if they no longer qualified for Medicaid or their benefits were reduced. The Governor, could, of course, propose new language in his budget to eliminate the requirement that the commonwealth abandon expansion if the match declines. Or he could speak out against any proposed cuts. To do either would likely draw the ire of the MAGA faithful, a group the governor is attempting to court as he contemplates a run for higher office.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most likely, he does nothing, in hopes the U.S. Senate has enough spine to prevent anything serious from happening.  It isn’t exactly leadership, but it preserves his options for another day.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin presents his proposed amendments to the state's biennial budget before a joint meeting of the Virginia General Assembly's money committees in Richmond on Wednesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the third consecutive year, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposed budget includes language seeking to eliminate state-funded abortions for severe fetal anomalies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title32.1/chapter3/section32.1-92.2/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> currently allows state insurance to cover abortions if a physician certifies that a fetus would be born with a “gross and totally incapacitating physical deformity or with a gross and totally incapacitating mental deficiency.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diagnoses like anencephaly, where a fetus’ skull and brain fail to fully develop, fall under this category.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s proposed </span><a href="https://budget.lis.virginia.gov/item/2025/1/HB1600/Introduced/4/4-5.04/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget amendments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strike language permitting state coverage for such procedures. The bill reads that “no expenditures from general or non-general fund sources may be made out of any appropriation by the General Assembly for providing abortion services, except otherwise as required by federal law or state statute,” with the state-funded exception removed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendment has failed in past budget negotiations as the legislature was split between Democratic and Republican control. With Democrats now holding a majority in both chambers, the proposal faces even steeper opposition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, Youngkin has continued to reintroduce the measure, aiming to reduce public funding spent on these abortions. Over the past four years, 121 state-funded abortions for severe fetal anomalies have been performed, according to the </span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/38/2024/10/SFA_summary_GA25_SFY2020_2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2020, two procedures cost the state about $5,000, while in 2024, 36 procedures cost approximately $61,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia Director Jamie Lockhart called Youngkin’s budget language “discriminatory” and “cruel.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People facing complex and heartbreaking situations, such as a severe fetal diagnosis, deserve compassion, support, and access to necessary abortion care — not stigma and funding barriers that put this care out of reach,” Lockhart said in a statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lockhart emphasized that the proposal would disproportionately affect low-income Virginians who rely on state coverage to navigate and and afford their pregnancies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With many fetal anomalies not diagnosed until around or after </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15 weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, she added that the policy would target families already grieving over the devastating realities of a wanted pregnancy gone awry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Youngkin’s administration defended the proposal as part of his broader budget focus on maternal health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Governor Youngkin announced significant new maternal health initiatives this week that will continue to promote a culture of life in the commonwealth, including not forcing Virginia taxpayers to subsidize abortions except where it is required by federal law,” spokesperson Christian Martinez said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-unveils-plan-to-improve-maternal-health-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has proposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over $4 million in investments for pilot programs and efforts to expand the maternal healthcare workforces. Similarly, Democratic lawmakers </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  a “momnibus” package of legislative and budget proposals aimed at improving maternal  health outcomes and providing support for parents-to-be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite potential agreement on maternal health initiatives, Youngkin’s abortion proposal faces stiff resistance.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Democrats are also advancing a proposed </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constitutional amendment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to enshrine abortion rights in Virginia’s Constitution. The amendment would need to pass in 2025 and 2026 legislative sessions before being placed on a statewide ballot for voter approval. </span></p>

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — U.S. House Democrats released details early Thursday on how much federal disaster aid each state would lose if Republicans&nbsp;drop it from a stopgap spending bill that’s been rejected by their own members as well as President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The state-by-state breakdown of roughly $100 billion came just hours after Trump and many of his closest allies, including tech billionaire Elon Musk, urged GOP leaders in Congress to walk away from a bipartisan year-end spending package.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That short-term spending bill, or some version of it, must become law before Friday at midnight, otherwise a partial government shutdown would begin. A partial shutdown would halt paychecks to federal employees and U.S. troops just ahead of the holiday season.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/CR2%20State%20by%20State_0.pdf" target="_blank">breakdown</a> shows states battered by hurricanes and other natural disasters such as California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia would miss out on more than $2 billion each, though the figures for the larger states go above $10 billion.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Misinformation over pay raise</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/chances-government-shutdown-escalate-after-trump-and-gop-reject-stopgap-spending-bill" target="_blank">stalemate over the short-term spending bill</a> began shortly after congressional leaders&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/huge-spending-bill-unveiled-congress-provides-more-100-billion-disaster-aid" target="_blank">released the 1,547-page package&nbsp;</a>on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaker Mike Johnson defended some of the extraneous measures during a press conference Tuesday before it was publicly released and during a Fox News interview Wednesday morning.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Louisiana Republican reinforced the need for disaster aid and economic assistance to farmers, though the spending package includes dozens of unrelated items, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/win-biofuels-stopgap-spending-bill-allows-year-round-sales-e15-gas-nationwide" target="_blank">a provision that would allow the nationwide sale of 15% ethanol blended gasoline</a> year round.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/members-congress-rolled-pay-raise-themselves-big-must-do-spending-bill" target="_blank">dropped a long-standing provision that blocked members of Congress from getting an annual cost of living adjustment&nbsp;</a>salary increase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There was considerable misinformation Wednesday around how much of a boost in pay lawmakers would stand to receive next Congress, riling up people who didn’t have access to the correct figures.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The incorrect numbers were spread by many online, but received special attention from Musk, who&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1869461048828522999" target="_blank">advocated shutting down the government&nbsp;</a>before Trump and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1869495076604227726" target="_blank">weighed in</a> later Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers would receive a maximum 3.8% salary increase, boosting their annual pay from $174,000 to $180,600, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/97-1011" target="_blank">report</a> released in September by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Lawmakers haven’t received a COLA increase since January 2009.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Sudden debt limit demand</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The full package, which congressional leaders and committees spent weeks negotiating, would have given Congress until March 14 to negotiate a bicameral agreement on the dozen annual government funding bills that were supposed to become law by the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans wanted to hold over the full-year spending bills until they have unified control of government next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The package would have given lawmakers until Sept. 30 to work out a deal on the five-year farm bill, which they should have completed work on well over a year ago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump pressed Wednesday for lawmakers to add the debt limit to negotiations, with just about two days left before the shutdown deadline. Working out a bipartisan agreement to raise or suspend the nation’s borrowing authority typically takes months of talks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he didn’t want to have to deal with the debt limit debate once his second administration begins on Jan. 20 and would rather have had it on President Joe Biden’s record.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/GarrettHaake/status/1869744357886263420" target="_blank">told NBC News on Thursday morning&nbsp;</a>that he wanted Congress to eliminate the debt limit entirely, marking a substantial shift in how Republicans have approached the cap on borrowing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The GOP typically leverages the debt ceiling debate to push for spending cuts, though not always successfully.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Democratic leaders in Congress maintain they are not going to renegotiate with Republicans, which would prevent any Republican-only bill from becoming law before the deadline. While the GOP controls the House, Democrats right now run the Senate and hold the White House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Thursday morning in a floor speech that GOP infighting over the bipartisan bill was risking an unnecessary government shutdown.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Unfortunately, it seems Republicans are in shambles over in the House,” Schumer said. “But as they try to piece things together, they should remember one thing — the only way to get things done is through bipartisanship.&#8221;</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Jeffries urges vote on stopgap</h4>
<p dir="ltr">House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., on didn’t entirely rule out lawmakers from his party voting for a slimmed-down stopgap spending bill, but urged GOP leaders to stick with the version they spent weeks negotiating.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This reckless Republican-driven shutdown can be avoided if House Republicans will simply do what is right for the American people and stick with the bipartisan agreement that they themselves negotiated,&#8221; Jeffries said at a Thursday press conference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s insistence that the package address the debt limit in some way was “premature at best,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Jeffries also said Democrats would not give Johnson extra votes to secure the speaker’s gavel in January, should several of his GOP colleagues refuse to vote for him during a floor vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Numerous far-right Republicans have hinted or said directly that they might not support Johnson continuing on as speaker due to their grievances over provisions in the stopgap spending bill.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans will have an extremely narrow House majority next year, meaning Johnson can only lose a few votes before the GOP would begin the third prolonged speaker race in just two years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy began this session of Congress in January 2023 going through 15 floor votes before he was able&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-gop-backs-mccarthy-speaker-after-tense-and-chaotic-late-night-session-25" target="_blank">to secure the votes needed</a> to become speaker.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-remove-kevin-mccarthy-speaker" target="_blank"> voting to oust</a> him a little over a year ago led to several GOP speaker nominees, who were unable to get the 218 votes needed to become speaker on a floor vote or who opted to not even try.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republicans nominated House Majority Leader&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/scalise-nominated-us-house-gop-speaker-closed-door-meeting" target="_blank">Steve Scalise&nbsp;</a>of Louisiana, Ohio Rep.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/ohios-jordan-latest-us-house-gop-nominee-speaker-after-days-turmoil" target="_blank">Jim Jordan&nbsp;</a>and Minnesota’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/emmer-nominated-us-house-speaker-drops-out-after-trump-opposition-0" target="_blank">Tom Emmer&nbsp;</a>before landing on Johnson, who was<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/mike-johnson-louisiana-elected-speaker-us-house-after-three-weeks-stalemate" target="_blank"> able to win a floor vote</a>.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Musk for speaker?</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-fails-attempt-oust-house-speaker-mike-johnson" target="_blank">tried but failed to oust Johnson as speaker</a> in May, has been leading the charge to select someone else, possibly Musk. The Constitution is silent on the question of whether the speaker must be a member of the House.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The establishment needs to be shattered just like it was yesterday,” Greene&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1869768295399964765" target="_blank">wrote</a> on social media. “This could be the way.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>This report has been updated with state-by-state numbers revised by U.S. House Democrats later Thursday morning.</em></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a new presidential administration taking office in January, Gov. Glenn Youngkin expressed optimism about potential fiscal benefits for Virginia, even as Democratic lawmakers voiced concerns about looming challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am so looking forward to having a period of tailwinds that will come out of Washington,” Youngkin said Wednesday following his budget proposal presentation in Richmond, signaling confidence in President-elect Donald Trump’s economic agenda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump has indicated plans to bring back the 2017 corporate tax cuts, raise tariffs on imported goods, and cut federal jobs, sparking debate among Virginia lawmakers over potential impacts. Discussions also touched on federal Medicaid cuts, which could significantly affect the state’s healthcare funding.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking during a joint session of the General Assembly’s money committees, Virginia’s Secretary of Finance Stephen Cummings mixed corporate income tax trends, noting that while refunds tied to corporate tax payments were slightly up, corporate tax revenues are down by $177.4 million compared to the same time last year. Cummings cited an uptick in </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/08/15/youngkin-taxes-corporation-refunds/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">corporate tax refunds</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a contributing factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve actually built in on corporate income tax a very conservative corporate tax view, reflecting some of the things that have taken place to date,” Cummings said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin defended tariffs as a way to ensure “America gets good deals first with our adversaries,” noting that the policy, first implemented by Trump during his first term, has continued under President Joe Biden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What I am seeing as a result of the discussion around tariffs is a literal line of businesses that want to invest in America, and particularly in Virginia,” Youngkin said, though he did not provide specific examples. “I think we’re going to see another level of growth here in the commonwealth as a result.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tax Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit think tank, projects that while tariffs </span><a href="https://taxfoundation.org/blog/trump-tariffs-revenue-estimates/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could raise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between $2 billion and $3.3 trillion from 2025 through 2034, they would also increase the cost of goods. This could result in an average annual tax burden of $1,253 to $2,045 per U.S. household over the same period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, expressed concerns over the broader application of tariffs compared to previous policies, which were more focused on China. “That’s a distinct difference from 2016 when it was more targeted on certain countries,” Hayes said. “Now we’re hearing about a more broad application.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings defended the previous tariffs, arguing that they contributed to economic growth despite targeting basic goods like steel and aluminum, which have widespread effects on manufacturing. “I don’t think you can really separate the two,” Cummings said, referring to the different types of tariffs being proposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationally, Democrats have touted improvements in the economy, pointing to a steady decline in inflation since its pandemic-era peak. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by another 0.25%, attributing the move to favorable economic conditions resulting from current policies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon-King, D-Prince William, raised concerns about the potential economic impact of federal job cuts, which would disproportionately affect Northern Virginia, home to a significant portion of the state’s federal workforce. A George Mason University analysis released before the election </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/trump-government-cuts-could-cost-house-republicans-majority-.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that eliminating 100,000 positions could result in an annual loss of $27-28 billion for Virginia’s economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s very definitely on the radar screen,” Cummings said, acknowledging the potential effects of such “very aggressive actions” on Virginia’s more than 200,000 federal workers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings noted that while federal jobs represent a small percentage of Virginia’s 4.2 million workers, their loss would still be felt. ”It’s not insignificant, but it’s not huge,” he said, adding that the private sector could potentially absorb displaced workers, given Virginia’s low 2.9% unemployment rate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, expressed concerns about the potential for </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/11/9-states-including-virginia-poised-to-end-coverage-for-millions-if-trump-cuts-medicaid-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">federal cuts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Medicaid expansion program’s funding match, emphasizing the importance of maintaining coverage for Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s an incredible benefit to having all Virginians insured,” Favola said, noting the link between health insurance and workforce participation. “I would hope the administration would be very amenable to continuing, at a minimum, our policy of insurance remains as many Virginians need insurance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cummings assured lawmakers that the state is prepared for potential Medicaid funding challenges. “We have fully provided for all the liabilities that we know of around Medicaid, and built in growth in our five-year plan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic leaders, who control the House of Delegates and the state Senate, said Wednesday they are still reviewing Youngkin’s budget proposals ahead of negotiations set to begin when the legislative session starts on Jan. 8.</span></p>

A simple story about a polio victim changed the writer’s mind. (Senator John Heinz History Center)

</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember, when I was maybe just 5 years old, chewing a sugar cube to ward off a horrible, deadly disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My father was with me in the long line some 60 years ago as we fought polio,</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/06/18/polio-vaccine-young-children-jfk/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">an affliction that killed people or left them paralyzed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Polio was — and to a small extent, still is — generally contracted by exposure in water that had fecal matter in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were in a large auditorium or maybe a community center in Washington, D.C. My dad and I each gulped down a cube that contained a weakened version of the live virus. No shots, no pain, just sweets. (An earlier vaccine developed in the mid-1950s</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2022/06/18/polio-vaccine-young-children-jfk/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Dr. Jonas Salk required a series of injections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decades ago, polio survivors often had to use iron lungs to help them breathe. Photos of the bulky metal contraptions, to this impressionable child, suggested spherical torture chambers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polio is</span><a href="https://asm.org/articles/2024/september/polio-s-last-stand-the-global-fight-for-eradicatio" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly eradicated today</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Children now usually get a polio vaccine at 2, 4 and 6 months, and then a final dose at 4-6 years old, Dr. Leah Rowland, a pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, told me by email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The vaccine is “extremely effective, offering lifelong immunity of 99-100%,” Rowland said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Americans rarely even talk about polio nowadays is a testament to the vaccine’s effectiveness and acceptance. It’s a huge success story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why the possible elevation of vaccine critics</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/vaccines-protect-your-children-and-others-too/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/12/15/dave-weldon-trump-cdc-vaccine-skepticism/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dave Weldon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — to head the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, respectively, in a second Trump administration — is so alarming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If not outright insane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the chamber’s minority leader, is a polio survivor. He’s assailed Kennedy for seeking to rescind approval of the polio vaccine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed — they’re dangerous,” McConnell said in a statement, according to Politico. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People my age probably have vague recollections of the earlier, unusual sugar rush of the polio vaccine. Such memories should remain ephemeral.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t, however, if misguided officials encourage conspiracy theories over proven vaccines. We don’t need a resurgence of diseases that are so easily preventable.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin presents his proposed amendments to the state's biennial budget before a joint meeting of the Virginia General Assembly's money committees in Richmond on Wednesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the cusp of his last full year in office, Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Wednesday unveiled a sweeping budget proposal that he hopes will define his legacy as Virginia’s 74th governor. Focused on tax cuts, infrastructure, education, and public health, the plan sets the stage for what could be a high-stakes 2025 legislative session as lawmakers weigh his ambitious priorities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We reopened Virginia’s economy after a global pandemic all while delivering surplus after surplus,” Youngkin said during a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees in Richmond. “Virginia is growing, Virginia is leading, and Virginia is winning. And this morning I ask you to join me in continuing that work together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized the state’s strong economic performance, pointing to job growth, corporate investment, and robust revenue increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The stock market is strong, and the Federal Reserve appears poised to reduce interest rates over the next year,” he said. “This backdrop further supports Virginia’s ongoing strong performance, with year-to-date revenues up 7.3% over 2024.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlighting more than $5 billion in tax cuts already delivered to Virginians over the last three years, Youngkin proposed additional measures to lower the cost of living. “Together, the commonwealth can make a clear statement that reducing tax burdens so Virginians can keep more of their hard-earned money in their pockets is not a Republican idea, it’s not a Democrat idea, it’s just common sense,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cornerstone in Youngkin’s proposed revisions to the two-year budget is a renewed push to eliminate the locally imposed personal car tax, an issue that he first came to embrace earlier this year after two Democrats campaigning for legislative seats in Southwest Virginia </span><a href="https://cardinalnews.org/2023/10/13/two-virginia-democrats-embrace-a-former-republican-governors-signature-policy-eliminate-the-car-tax/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as part of their platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car tax has been a Republican rallying point since 1997, when GOP gubernatorial nominee Jim Gilmore successfully campaigned on repealing the unpopular levy. However, without a clear plan during the 2024 legislative session, the proposal quickly fizzled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, Youngkin once again urged the General Assembly to abolish what he called Virginia’s “most hated tax since the tax on tea” that he said cost the average Virginia family of four about $290 annually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Standing here today, I will renew my call for us to work to fully eliminate the car tax, but recognizing that this might not be possible in this short session, there is an incremental step that we should take together to provide additional car tax relief,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the new proposal, the state would deposit $1.1 billion into a car tax credit fund to provide income tax rebates to nearly 1.9 million taxpayers earning up to $50,000 in adjusted gross income for individuals or $100,000 for couples filing jointly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligible taxpayers would receive up to $150 for individual returns or $300 for joint returns annually for the next three years. After the fund is exhausted, the state would see a permanent reduction of $360 million in tax revenues each year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin also is asking the legislature to extend the standard deductions for state income tax returns — currently set at  $8,500 for individuals and $17,000 for joint filers — that are set to expire at the end of next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Failure to make the standard deduction permanent before Jan. 1, 2026, would result in tax increases of $57 million in fiscal year 2026 and $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2027, the governor said. “My friends, there is no reason to raise taxes on Virginians. We are running surplus after surplus after surplus.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic lawmakers responded cautiously to Youngkin’s budget plan Wednesday, emphasizing the need to review the details before committing to any initiatives. With the legislative session set to begin in January, both the House and Senate are preparing to roll out their own budget amendment proposals, signaling potential negotiations ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our focus will remain on targeted investments that benefit all Virginians,” said House Appropriations Chair Del. Luke Torian, D-Prince William. “We will explore how we can work across the aisle to ensure K-12 schools are fully funded, higher education is accessible, and affordable housing becomes a reality for more families. These are areas where we can and should find common ground.”</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, in a statement thanked Youngkin for presenting his budget and for “initiating this important conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now, our responsibility is to evaluate these proposals thoughtfully and collaboratively to ensure they reflect the priorities of all Virginians. We can craft a budget that strengthens our schools, supports our communities, and provides real solutions for working families,” Scott said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate’s president pro tempore, said that while her chamber will consider his proposal, the Democrats’ amendments will look different. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Senate budget will provide relief to working families and individuals and invest in their education and well-being, while maintaining the commonwealth&#8217;s long-term fiscal health,” Lucas said. “Here in the Senate, we look beyond elections and talk-show appearances and budget for the long-haul.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other key initiatives in Youngkin’s proposed budget amendments:</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘No tax on tips’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration is also proposing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/16/youngkin-pitches-tax-relief-for-tipped-workers-in-budget-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to eliminate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> state taxes on tips for service industry workers, a policy similar to one championed by President-elect Donald Trump. If approved, the measure would allow tipped workers to claim a deduction on their state tax returns, with compliance monitored through IRS data and employer-reported W-2 forms. The proposal could benefit an estimated 250,000 Virginians. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has an incredible hospitality, restaurant and service industry, and hardworking Virginians should keep every penny of the tips they earn through their exceptional service. My proposal is very simple — no more taxes on tips,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the move is being framed as a win for workers, its broader implications remain unclear. Economists warn that some employers might exploit the policy by shifting more of a worker’s compensation to tips rather than wages, a concern </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-and-harris-say-theyll-kill-taxes-on-tips-how-would-that-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">also raised</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around similar federal legislation. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Education </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin is proposing nearly $1 billion in new education funding, including a $50-million Virginia Opportunity Scholarship Program to provide $5,000 annual grants for private school expenses like tuition and transportation. About 10,000 K-12 students from families earning up to twice the federal poverty limit to qualify for free school meals would qualify, with funding coming from revenue growth, not existing education budgets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan includes $25 million for lab school partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities and nearly $500 for higher education capital projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, there is no new funding for college operating expenses, and Youngkin is pushing for a 2.5% cap on tuition increases. “It’s time for our colleges to cut administrative bloat and handle costs without asking taxpayers for more,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional proposals include $290 million for school construction, $550 million in direct aid, $6.8 million for school resource officers, and $50 million to support underperforming schools. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">VMSDEP</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/07/jlarc-review-of-vmsdep-no-evidence-of-peak-or-decline-in-participation-levels/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">(VMSDEP)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides tuition waivers to spouses and children of military members killed or permanently disabled in service, would receive $60 million from a surplus in the state’s 529 college savings program to address a funding shortfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers scrutinized the program last year after it was initially excluded from budget negotiations. Concerns over its sustainability arose as participation surged by nearly 350%, growing from about 1,400 participants in 2019 to about 6,400 in 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The allocation would come without any new policy proposals.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Withholding funds to quash ‘sanctuary cities’ </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin further echored national Republican rhetoric by declaring that “every state has become a border state” as he unveiled plans to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-wants-to-restrict-funding-for-localities-that-dont-comply-with-immigration-enforcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cut funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to localities that limit or refuse compliance with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal aligns with a broader GOP push against “sanctuary city” policies, which vary but often involve local governments choosing not to inquire about immigration status or declining full cooperation with ICE. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But with Virginia’s legislature under Democratic control, this proposal is expected to face significant opposition during the upcoming budget negotiations.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Boosting maternal health outcomes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin and Democratic lawmakers are prioritizing </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in their legislative and budget </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/17/in-bipartisan-push-virginia-lawmakers-target-rural-healthcare-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, increasing the chances that some measures will make it through budget negotiations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s plan </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-unveils-plan-to-improve-maternal-health-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes $2.5 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for perinatal health hubs, expanded funding for OB-GYN residencies, and a $500,000 education campaign to help parents recognize life threatening conditions like heart attacks or eclampsia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also proposes $1 million to support workforce development for midwives and doulas, both crucial professions in addressing care gaps and advocating for patients, particularly those of color impacted by racial health disparities. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mental health support</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Virginia enters its third year of its Right Help, Right Now initiative, Youngkin’s latest budget request includes </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/13/meet-people-where-they-are-special-teams-aid-va-s-efforts-to-expand-mental-health-care-services/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$35 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to improve crisis response involving law enforcement. The funding would support hiring </span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/licensure-and-regulatory-affairs/special-conservators-peace" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special conservators of the peace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or “s-cops,” as Youngkin calls them.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These intermediaries would assist with individuals awaiting hospital admissions after mental health crises, aiming to de-escalate situations where people in crisis might unintentionally harm  officers and face jail time. Youngkin envisions the “s-cops” fostering better outcomes for those in crisis while allowing law enforcement officers to focus on their regular duties.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disaster relief</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The administration proposes allocating $127 million toward a permanent </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/09/20/after-hurley-and-whitewood-floods-virginia-considers-state-relief-fund/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disaster relief fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to aid victims of natural disasters beyond what the federal assistance, insurance and private donations cover. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southwest Virginia has faced repeated flooding in recent years, most recently from Hurricane Helene in September, which claimed three lives and caused $4.4 billion in </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/03/va-dept-of-transportation-estimates-hurricane-helene-debris-cleanup-will-take-3-to-6-months/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Youngkin said $25 million could come from the general fund, with $102 million sourced from the latest round of revenues of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin had previously </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/20/judge-deems-youngkins-actions-to-withdraw-virginia-from-rggi-unlawful/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sought to withdraw</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia from RGGI, despite praise from environmental groups for its funding for flood resilience and energy efficiency programs. “I fully expect that the General Assembly will work constructively together in this next short session to appropriate funds specifically for Hurricane Helene relief,” he said on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, questioned the governor’s proposal, pointing to his approach of using RGGI revenues. “Why not just put us back in RGGI?” she asked, while noting uncertainty about the fund’s legislative support.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t know yet,” she said in an interview. </span></p>

(Photo courtesy of the Chesapeake Bay Program)</p><p>A new bill in the U.S. Senate aims to combat illegal fishing practices and trade of endangered species worldwide, according to U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy.</p>
<p>The Louisiana Republican is sponsoring the proposal with with Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va. The Protecting Global Fisheries Act would expand the U.S. government’s authority to create and enforce maritime law alongside other nations, with their efforts centered on illegal and unregulated fishing practices.</p>
<p>The bill would also extend powers to the president to sanction people and vessels from other countries that violate these international agreements or participate in the sale, movement or purchase of endangered species.</p>
<p>“Illegal fishing practices abroad threaten Louisiana. Seafood production is a driver of our economy and way of life,” Cassidy said in a news release.</p>
<p>The bill will prevent “unfair competition” from countries such as China and “can preserve jobs, protect our local economies, strengthen national security, and safeguard marine habitats,” the senator added.</p>
<p>Illegal fishing practices the bill aims to curb include fishing without proper licensing, failure to report catches or falsifying reports, use of prohibited fishing gear and unpermitted transfer of fish to cargo vessels.</p>
<p>Louisiana has a long standing history with the fishing industry, generating around $2.4 billion a year, according to numbers Cassidy cited. Louisiana is well-known for its shrimp, crab, crawfish and oyster fisheries but also brings in between 600 million and 900 million <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/10/31/fish-spills/" target="_blank">menhaden</a> a year. Also known as pogies, menhaden are used to make fertilizer and animal feed. Their offshore harvests generate $25 million in state tax revenue annually and employ around 2,000 people.</p>
<p>The Cassidy-Kaine bill is also being pitched as a defense for the state’s shrimping industry, which has <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2023/06/02/louisiana-shrimpers-say-theyve-been-stranded-while-lawmakers-tread-water/" target="_blank">suffered</a> in recent years from onslaught of imported seafood flooding the market and tanking prices of local catch.</p>

(Courtesy of Commonwealth Fusion Systems)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia could soon make history as the home of the world’s first nuclear fusion power plant, state officials and private sector leaders announced Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a fusion power company founded in 2018 in Cambridge, Mass., unveiled plans to build the groundbreaking facility on a 100-acre site at James River Industrial Park in Chesterfield County. The plant, expected to generate 400 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 150,000 homes — could be operational by the early 2030s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Commonwealth Fusion Systems plans on building the world’s first grid scale commercial fusion power plant in the world, full stop, and it’s going to be right here in the commonwealth of Virginia,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said at a presentation of the undertaking at Richmond’s Patrick Henry Building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional nuclear power plants that rely on fission, fusion replicates the energy-producing process of the sun, offering a cleaner and more sustainable power source. The project, which would occupy about 25 acres of the site, signals Virginia’s growing role in shaping future energy solutions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement comes as Virginia’s energy needs are surging, driven by the rapid growth of data centers that power big tech operations. These facilities consume enormous amounts of  electricity and water to process and cool computer systems.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks during an announcement with Commonwealth Fusion Systems Tuesday. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A report from the nonpartisan Joint Legislative Audit Review Commission (JLARC) released last week found that energy demand from data centers could triple from about 10,000 megawatts today to about 30,000 megawatts by 2040 if infrastructure, like new transmission lines, were already available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s two largest utilities, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, are already exploring small modular nuclear reactors to meet rising  energy demands, with Dominion also investing in offshore wind, solar and natural gas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fusion power offers another path to clean energy, avoiding emissions that scientists link to  climate change and its increasingly intense and frequent storms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fusion technology works by combining hydrogen isotopes — deuterium extracted from water and tritium from lithium — under extreme heat and pressure, using powerful magnets to fuse the elements. The process generates heat, which boils water to create steam that spins a turbine, producing electricity. The byproduct is helium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our customers’ growing needs for reliable, carbon-free power benefits from as diverse a menu of power generation options as possible, and in that spirit, we are delighted to assist CFS in their efforts,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said Dominion Energy Virginia President Edward H. Baine, in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFS selected the Chesterfield site after conducting a global search. The company will lease the land from Dominion Energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To secure the project, Virginia offered $1 million from the Virginia Energy Clean Energy Innovation Bank, $1 million from Chesterfield County, and a sales and use tax exemption for the plant’s equipment. The company has also received U.S. Department of Energy funding. Youngkin said the project would bring “billions” in economic development and create “hundreds” of jobs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CFS is currently building its </span><a href="https://cfs.energy/technology/sparc" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SPARC demonstration plant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Massachusetts, a project that will pave the way for the ARC technology planned for Chesterfield. While the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California achieved a major milestone in 2022 by demonstrating fusion using lasers, CFS employs a different approach. Their technology relies on a donut-shaped device called a tokamak to confine and fuse molecules.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41547" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2000px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/cfs-arc-powerplant-2000px/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41547" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px.jpg 2000w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-powerplant-2000px-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A rendering of the ARC donut shaped tokamak technology. (Courtesy of Commonwealth Fusion Systems)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You won’t need a pipeline to bring the fuel in, or a smokestack for the exhaust,” said CFS co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Bob Mumgaard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike fission, which splits heavy atoms like uranium to produce energy — and leaves behind radioactive waste — fusion creates energy by fusing light atoms, explained Alex Creely, CFS director of tokamak operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the big advantages of fusion is that it doesn’t produce any long lived waste material, and there’s no risk of some kind of meltdown event,” Creely said. “It&#8217;s a very safe energy source — something that you can live right next to and feel very comfortable with.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, said in a statement Tuesday that he will introduce legislation to define fusion energy in state code. The energy source would be allowed as &#8220;zero-carbon electricity&#8221; under the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law aimed at  decarbonizing the state’s electric grid. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since the VCEA’s passage, we have succeeded in driving energy innovation in the commonwealth, and today marks another important step in what has been a remarkably successful effort — a step that would not have been possible had Virginia declined or abandoned the opportunity and responsibility it took to lead in clean energy,” Sullivan said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin emphasized that the project will be financed entirely by CFS, with no cost passed on to Dominion Energy ratepayers. The facility will operate as an independent l power producer, selling its electricity to specific customers through power purchase agreements or directly into the regional PJM Interconnection market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a reasonable hypothesis that the growth in data centers in Virginia will very happily take the power that is generated at this plant,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41546" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2000px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/cfs-arc-facility-front-2000px/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41546" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px.jpg 2000w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CFS-ARC-facility-front-2000px-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Another rendering of the Commonwealth Fusion Systems proposal for Chesterfield County. (Courtesy of Commonwealth Fusion Systems)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preston Bryant, senior vice president at McGuireWoods Consulting, which was involved in the site selection process, said Virginia was chosen in part because the Nuclear Regulatory Commission determined  months ago that fusion technology does not require a federal license like fission and can instead be approved at the state level.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project will still need several state permits, including a radioactive materials license from the Virginia Department of Health, and a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">certificate of convenience and public necessity from the State Corporation Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kristen Cullen, vice president of global policy and public affairs at CFS, said additional approvals may include an air permit from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality for backup generators during emergencies and potentially a storm water discharge permit, depending on the site-design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryant noted that it was “a coincidence” that the selected site was initially chosen by Dominion for a proposed natural gas plant before the utility relocated that project to the nearby, former coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement followed discussions with  local environmental groups, which expressed some support for the project, but also raised questions about its impact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Considering rising energy demand in Virginia driven by data centers and that most folks in the environmental world are not in support of more gas infrastructure, SMRs or hydrogen energy, this seems like a promising solution, if and when it actually comes online,” said Melissa Thomas, senior organizer with Mothers out Front, a climate advocacy group. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thomas also raised questions about whether the plant’s backup power would rely on gas-powered systems or electric alternatives.</span></p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note:</em> This story was corrected to explain the upcoming legislation from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, and how fusion is allowed under the Virginia Clean Economy Act.</p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jasmine Storrs took the stage Tuesday, she didn’t hold back: She nearly died after childbirth because she ignored her body’s warning signs. Now, she wants other women to listen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Storrs, who suffered a heart attack after days of chest tightness, shared her harrowing experience before Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced a slate of investments aimed at improving maternal health outcomes in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Time is muscle,” she recalled her doctor saying before nine hours of open-heart surgery — words that saved her life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The message was echoed by Sen. Emily Jordan, R-Suffolk, who ignored eclampsia signs after the birth of her third child in September. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think a lot of women feel guilty going through the birthing process or pregnancy process because they have other responsibilities,” Jordan said. “We have to be empowered to ask the right questions at the right time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both women joined Youngkin who wants to invest $2.5 million in perinatal health hub pilot programs, $1 million to expand support for doulas and community health workers in local health districts, $500,000 for a public awareness campaign on life-threatening pregnancy complications, and additional funding for OB-GYN and psychiatric medical residencies in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposals are part of Youngkin’s broader budget request, which he will present to the state legislature’s finance committees on Wednesday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visibly emotional during the announcement, Youngkin reflected on his mother’s career as an OB-GYN nurse practitioner, calling the moment a “chance to speak for her.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also issued an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/ED-11---Maternal-Health-FINAL-12.17.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state health department to include pregnancy-related data on its Maternal and Child Health Data dashboard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s latest efforts  build on previous work to strengthen  maternal health, including his support for</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> expanding </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/04/17/petersburg-maternal-hub-opening-reignites-discussion-over-commercial-doula-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health hubs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Petersburg and signing a bill earlier this year  requiring health insurance </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coverage for doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s announcement comes as Democrats prepare their own push to address maternal disparities through a comprehensive “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">momnibus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” package of bills and budget proposals — a riff on the term omnibus.  The effort follows an October summit in Richmond that brought together lawmakers and medical experts to tackle maternal health challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bipartisan rural healthcare committee has also highlighted maternal health gaps in its legislative recommendations following a statewide tour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the 2025 legislative session set to convene on Jan. 8, improving maternal healthcare is emerging as a shared priority, offering a rare opportunity for bipartisan action in Richmond.  </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers criss-crossing rural Virginia this year heard a common refrain: Rural communities are struggling with healthcare workforce shortages and transportation challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After months of meetings and site visits, the bipartisan  House Select Committee on Advancing Rural and Small Town Health Care on Tuesday released its report with a slate of legislative and budgetary recommendations aimed at tackling those challenges.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the proposals are state-funded grants to help rural healthcare providers recruit professionals and increased investments in nursing education programs to build a stronger workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To improve transportation access, the report proposes  a new program to provide rides to free clinics and federally qualified health centers. Lawmakers point to Virginia’s existing non-emergency transportation program for Medicaid patients, run by the Department of Medical Assistance Services, as a potential model. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve got something that’s at least serving some people,” Committee Chair Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, said during a September meeting on the Eastern Shore. “Can we leverage that? Is there a way to expand that for non-Medicaid folks who have certain income levels or live in certain areas? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee also recommends requiring insurers to cover audio-only telehealth services. Willett previously told The Mercury that it would be a lifeline for people with limited broadband access, as well as older patients or those without computers who rely on phones for remote medical care.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Support for rural parents-to-be</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key section of the report focuses on maternal healthcare, aligning with a recently announced “</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/momnibus-package-aims-to-close-maternal-health-gaps-across-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">momnibus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” package of bills and budget proposals from Democratic lawmakers. Gov. Glenn Youngkin has also outlined his own plans to address maternal health, setting the stage for a bipartisan push in the 2025 legislative session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With about 30% of Virginians living in areas with limited or no maternity care services, rural patients are often forced to travel long distances  for care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midwives have become essential in filling these maternal care gaps providing perinatal care in homes, birth centers and rural hospitals. To bolster this workforce, the report recommends increased Medicaid reimbursement rates for midwives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Midwives are often rooted in the communities they serve and more likely to stay, compared to some OB-GYN medical residents that may work in rural areas for a time before leaving for work elsewhere. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Youngkin has committed to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/17/virginias-state-budget-will-fund-ob-gyn-medical-residencies-amid-obstetrics-closures/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuing funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for OB-GYN and family practice medical residencies — which are critical as rural hospitals close obstetrics units — the report calls for broader investment in medical residencies statewide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Youngkin on Tuesday announced his support for legislation to streamline out-of-state midwives seeking to practice in Virginia, further strengthening the maternal health workforce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report further recommends boosting funding for community college doula training programs, recognizing the critical role doulas play in supporting parents-to-be and improving health outcomes. This support is especially impactful for patients of color, who face disproportionate risks during pregnancy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black women are significantly </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to die </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from pregnancy complications when compared to white women. Studies point to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a contributing factor to poorer health outcomes for women of color, where doulas have been key advocates for patients’ needs and care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Youngkin signed a bill supporting health insurance </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/youngkin-doulas-black-maternal-health-general-assembly/article_34a9f222-f379-11ee-8dc9-e36a8194fce6.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coverage for doulas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, acknowledging their role in maternal health. But he </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a separate measure that would have required unconscious bias training for nursing license renewals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bias training remains a key recommendation from the rural health committee, though it has faced resistance from some Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committee member Del. Otto Wachsmann, R-Sussex, clarified the hesitation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The problem isn’t that Republicans are against cultural awareness training — I think everybody is really for that —  but it’s putting another burden on the providers,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in the day, when Youngkin outlined maternal health policies that he supports, The Mercury asked what changes might make him reconsider the unconscious bias bill if reintroduced, he acknowledged the disparities in health outcomes for patients of color compared to white patients, but didn&#8217;t specify if he would support the bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the right way to address it is to use the data that we gather and analyze to put forth really specific initiatives,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin was referring to an </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/executive-actions/ED-11---Maternal-Health-FINAL-12.17.24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the state’s health department to include pregnancy-related data on its Maternal and Child Health Data dashboard.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Looking forward</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As lawmakers discussed the recommendations from their report, many reflected on the bipartisan companionship built during their work on the committee — a spirit of collaboration they hope to carry into the 2025 session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These were overnight trips,” Wachsmann said. “We found a lot of camaraderie together just breaking bread at the table and spending time together.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representing a rural district, Wachsmann has firsthand experience with the challenges highlighted in the report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve watched as our areas have lost pharmacies,” Wachsmann said. “I’ve seen our grocery stores leave.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that it was “refreshing” to see lawmakers  from both rural and urban districts come together to focus on the unique struggles facing  rural communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Willett, the committee chair, emphasized that while the proposals aren’t a complete solution, they represent important steps toward improving healthcare access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if all of the committee’s roughly 30 proposals are eventually adopted, Willett said  that rural healthcare issues won’t “go away” overnight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can speak for all of us here in saying that we’re committed to staying on the case and making that progress,” he said. </span></p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">Members of Congress are among those calling for greater transparency from the federal government as a spate of reported drone sightings concentrated in New Jersey and New York has raised questions beyond the Northeast.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reported sightings of drones, officially known as unmanned aerial systems, or UAS, have spiked since Nov. 18, when authorities received several reports of suspicious drone activity near critical infrastructure in New Jersey, according to an FBI official in the state who briefed reporters over the weekend.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The increased activity has worried some and led to calls from lawmakers for the federal agencies to provide more information on drone activity, even as security officials urged caution.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a statement that described an “epidemic of non-stop drone sightings,” U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for the federal government to deploy more drone-detection systems and to share information with local authorities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I want it deployed widely across New York and New Jersey to help give us concrete answers on what is going on, and from where,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said of a drone-detection system that the federal government uses. “What we need right now is data. The briefings I have had tell me there is no evidence that this is a government or foreign activity, and so, we have to answer the logical of question of: who?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Schumer called on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to deploy the drone-detection system and said he would cosponsor a bill that would give local law enforcement more authority to respond to drone sightings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Drones, like planes and other users of the national airspace, are regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We still have very few answers on where some of these drones come from and who may be operating them,” Schumer said Monday on the Senate floor. “The people of New York and New Jersey have a lot of questions and haven’t gotten many answers. We know one thing, though. Local officials now don’t have the resources nor the authority to get to the bottom of what’s happening.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">On CBS’ Sunday morning news show “Face the Nation,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is a senior member of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee with jurisdiction over the FAA, called for federal officials to brief U.S. senators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We need more transparency,” she said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">‘No evidence’ of threat, says DOD</h4>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Defense Department spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters Monday that there was “no evidence at this time that the reported drone sightings pose a national security or public safety threat or have a foreign nexus.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Regardless, he said he wanted to take the public’s concerns seriously, but also offered further context.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The drone industry is expanding, with more than 1 million hobbyist and commercial drones licensed by the FAA and 8,000 in use daily.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He likened the drone sightings, even those near military installations or other important sites, to drivers who may get lost and turn up in their cars at places they are not supposed to be, something he said happens regularly without incident.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The point being is that flying drones is not illegal,” he said. “There are thousands of drones flown around the U.S. on a daily basis. So, as a result, it’s not that unusual to see drones in the sky, nor is it an indication of malicious activity or any public safety threat.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, noted Monday that federal investigators had not found any malicious activity and <a href="https://newjerseymonitor.com/2024/12/16/governor-murphy-asks-public-to-calm-down-over-drone-sightings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urged residents to “calm down”</a> about drone sightings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many recent reports of drones, noted by non-experts, turned out to be commercial planes flying regularly scheduled nighttime routes.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">More than 5,000 tips</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The New Jersey-based FBI official said that the vast majority of the more than 5,000 tips his office received in the past month related to unidentified objects in the night skies have not been “actionable.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The official, who briefed reporters along with officials from other agencies on the condition their names not be used, said the FBI was working to identify the 100 or so tips that did warrant further investigation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I don’t want to cause alarm and panic, but you can’t ignore the sightings that have been there, and we are concerned about those just as much as anybody else is,” the FBI official said. “We’re doing our best to find the origin of that specific — of those drone activities. But I think there has been a slight overreaction.”</p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s top investigatory body is turning its attention to Red Onion State Prison following alarming reports of self-harm and poor conditions at the supermax facility in Wise County.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrea Sapone, the state’s new corrections ombudsman, announced Monday that her office will prioritize an investigation into living conditions and the health and safety of incarcerated individuals at the prison, which has faced scrutiny after a hunger strike in 2023 and six cases of people burning themselves this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Office of the State Inspector General takes all allegations of abuse seriously,” she told the House of Delegates’ Public Safety Committee. “A Red Onion investigation will be prioritized as soon as we have full staff to do it properly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An offer has been extended for one position, and a pool of candidates is under consideration to fill four more roles, an OSIG spokesperson confirmed to The Mercury.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calls for oversight at Red Onion have grown louder from prison reform advocates, lawmakers and families of incarcerated individuals. Allegations against the facility include poor living conditions, mistreatment and the extended  use of solitary confinement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a presentation to the committee on Monday, Department of Corrections director Chad Dotson suggested the recent incidents of self-harm were attempts by inmates to secure transfers to other prisons closer to their families. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no evidence whatsoever that there was any kind of a plot or a protest,” Dotson said. “All the inmates involved said they did it because they wanted to get away from Red Onion. Two of these have a history of self-harm.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Taj Mahon-Haft, founder of the Humanization Project, pushed back, emphasizing that the underlying issue is the level of desperation that drives people to harm themselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahon-Haft, who was formerly incarcerated, said he understands firsthand the challenges of imprisonment, particularly how prolonged isolation can lead to harmful thoughts or actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">April Wright shared a harrowing account during the meeting, revealing that her incarcerated son had apparently attempted to hang himself. Wright said she only learned of the incident when another inmate reached out to inform her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The use of solitary confinement, or what Virginia calls “restorative housing,”  was another major focus of the discussion. Under a state law enacted last year, incarcerated individuals in restorative housing are now granted four hours a day outside their cells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson described the practice as a temporary measure, explaining that it is reserved for individuals with serious behavioral infractions who may pose a threat to themselves or others. </span></p>

<p>Nearly 95% of people who have experienced loss report dealing with <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/il/news-releases/empathy-releases-annual-cost-of-dying-report-for-2024-302036982.html" target="_blank">at least one symptom of physical or mental distress</a>. Approximately 10% of them develop <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/prolonged-grief-disorder" target="_blank">prolonged grief disorder</a>, a persistent and debilitating form of grief that does not ease with time.</p>
<p>Often, this grief is due to the death of a loved one, but it may also be caused by the loss of a friendship, a divorce or even a job loss.</p>
<p>Grief affects not only <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/special-reports/grief-stages/20190711/the-grief-experience-survey-shows-its-complicated" target="_blank">mental health</a> but also <a href="https://doi.org/10.31887/DCNS.2012.14.2/tbuckley" target="_blank">physical well-being</a>, and it can increase the risk of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.111.061770" target="_blank">heart disease</a>, immune dysfunction and even death.</p>
<p>Holidays and special occasions, which often include family gatherings, traditions and reminders of what’s missing, can amplify this pain, leaving those grieving feeling isolated and overwhelmed.</p>
<p>As a clinical psychologist and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f9DdtPUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank">professor of psychiatry and neurobehavioral sciences</a> working with cancer patients and their families, I see the profound toll grief takes on people. I’ve also experienced grief personally, both when my mother died suddenly at the age of 66 and when my father passed after a long illness at the age of 84.</p>
<p>Those experiences, combined with my research, have driven me to dedicate much of my career to understanding grief and its effects, and to finding effective ways to support those who are struggling with it.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Mourning vs. prolonged grief</h4>

	
<p>Grief is a natural response to loss, encompassing emotional, cognitive, physical and social reactions. Common signs include sadness, withdrawal, difficulty concentrating, disrupted sleep and physical symptoms like fatigue or aches.</p>
<p>Grief is deeply personal, and while <a href="https://theconversation.com/processing-and-grieving-an-ongoing-loss-such-as-a-child-with-a-devastating-injury-or-disability-does-not-fit-neatly-into-traditional-models-of-grief-205459" target="_blank">there is no “right” way to grieve</a>, most people move through the process over time, finding a new equilibrium in their lives.</p>
<p>However, some people experience <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/prolonged-grief-disorder" target="_blank">prolonged grief disorder</a>, a condition newly recognized in psychiatry’s gold-standard manual, the <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/psychiatrists/practice/dsm" target="_blank">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition</a>, in 2022.</p>
<p>This condition is characterized by intense yearning, sorrow or preoccupation with the deceased that persists for 12 months or more, significantly impairing daily functioning. People experiencing this disorder often feel disconnected from life and unable to find joy or meaning.</p>
<p>Unlike nonpathological grief, prolonged grief disorder is associated with chronic activation of the <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/grieving-changes-brain" target="_blank">brain’s stress response system</a>, particularly in areas like the <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24894-amygdala" target="_blank">amygdala</a>. The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped cluster of neurons in the brain that plays a key role in processing emotions, especially fear, stress and threat-related responses. Prolonged grief disorder is also linked to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/complicated-grief/symptoms-causes/syc-20360374" target="_blank">mental health conditions</a> such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.</p>
<p>As you support a friend or family member in their grief, it’s important to watch for signs of prolonged grief disorder because it requires targeted interventions. Research, including my ongoing studies on the use of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09540261.2024.2357668" target="_blank">psilocybin-assisted therapy</a> for the treatment of grief, highlights the importance of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/interview-with-dr-kim-penberthy-of-dops/id1647611444?i=1000663669728" target="_blank">innovative approaches</a> to help those stuck in the cycle of prolonged grief.</p>
<p>If you suspect someone you love is struggling with prolonged grief, encouraging them to seek help and offering to support them in the process can be life-changing. Resources are available, from grief counseling to support groups. Organizations like <a href="http://grief.org/" target="_blank">the American Grief Foundation</a> and local mental health services can provide further guidance for helping a loved one get the treatment they require.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Caring for our own grief on holidays and special occasions</h4>

	
<p>Research supports several strategies for addressing grief, whether typical or prolonged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Express emotions: Suppressing grief can exacerbate mental and physical health issues. Talking with trusted friends, journaling and joining support groups <a href="https://www.betterhelp.com/advice/grief/what-does-inhibited-grief-look-like" target="_blank">can be therapeutic</a>.</li>
<li>Engage in rituals: Personal or cultural rituals, like lighting a candle, visiting a grave site or creating a memory book help integrate loss into one’s life.</li>
<li>Create new traditions as a way to honor your loss: If you’re mourning a death, consider integrating your loved one’s memory into the occasion by preparing their favorite dish, playing their favorite music or hanging an ornament in their honor.</li>
<li>Seek professional support: <a href="https://theconversation.com/cbt-dbt-psychodynamic-what-type-of-therapy-is-right-for-me-171101" target="_blank">Cognitive behavioral therapy</a> or complicated grief therapy <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/treating-prolonged-grief-disorder-innovations-and-future-directions" target="_blank">can be effective treatments</a> for prolonged grief disorder. Psychedelic-assisted therapy is also <a href="https://theconversation.com/psilocybin-legislation-is-helping-psychedelic-drugs-make-a-comeback-a-drug-researcher-explains-the-challenges-they-face-233854" target="_blank">emerging as a promising option</a>

<p>in clinical research.</li>
</ul>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Supporting someone as they grief</h4>

	
<p>For those grieving, holidays and special occasions like a birthday or Mother’s Day <a href="https://theconversation.com/for-many-who-are-suffering-with-prolonged-grief-the-holidays-can-be-a-time-to-reflect-and-find-meaning-in-loss-218906" target="_blank">can be especially difficult</a>. Here are some practical tips for supporting someone who is grieving during these times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that grief is not a problem to be solved, but a process to be supported.</li>
<li>Be present. A common fear is saying the wrong thing to someone who is grieving. Often, it’s not about saying the “perfect” thing, but simply showing up and listening without judgment.</li>
<li>Acknowledge the loss. Saying “I’ve been thinking about (their loved one) and how much they meant to you” or “I want you to know that I’ve been thinking about you and the significance of what you’re experiencing right now” can be more comforting than avoiding the subject.</li>
<li>Offer practical help. Grief can be debilitating and exhausting. Assisting with tasks like cooking, shopping or child care can relieve some of the burden.</li>
<li>If you don’t know what to say, it’s OK to admit it. A simple “I don’t have the right words, but I’m here for you” can mean a great deal.</li>
<li>Avoid phrases like “They’re in a better place” or “Everything happens for a reason.” While the intentions behind them are often good, these platitudes can feel dismissive.</li>
<li>Focus on empathy and validation. Saying “This must be so hard for you” or “Tell me more about what you’re feeling” opens the door to meaningful conversation and helps make space for the complex emotions that grief brings.</li>
<li>Respect the boundaries of your loved one who’s grieving. Let them honor their emotions by going at their own pace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Navigating holidays and special occasions with those who have experienced a loss can be complicated. But your presence and compassion in these moments can support their healing.</p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers are gearing up for a renewed push to tackle maternal health disparities in the 2025 session, with a slate of bills and budget amendments focused on improving outcomes for parents across the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key proposal is a bipartisan effort to mandate </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/virginia-black-maternal-health-carroll-foy-youngkin/article_4608fd84-d1ae-11ee-8379-138efdfc34c7.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unconscious bias training</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for nursing license renewals, which previously passed the legislature but </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/20/youngkin-vetoes-bills-on-contraception-access-skill-games-confederate-heritage-rollbacks/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">was vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers say that targeted training is critical in addressing preventable deaths and complications during childbirth, marking it as a vital step in the broader push for maternal health reform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveals a stark disparity in maternal health: Black women are significantly </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more likely to die</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">from pregnancy-related complications than white women. Research also highlights that women of color often face worse  health outcomes, partly due to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384760" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">racial bias</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in healthcare settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, emphasized the urgency of addressing these inequities, stating that the proposed legislation aims to tackle the “broken systems and lack of resources” contributing to poor maternal health outcomes, particularly for Black parents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “momnibus” package — a play on the term omnibus — also includes proposals to enhance healthcare monitoring and expanded Medicaid coverage to improve maternal health outcomes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re hoping that when these bills get before them, they will continue that support,” Mundon King said.</span></p>

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump pledged Monday to keep the polio vaccine available throughout his presidency, but didn’t extend that protection to other vaccines, saying he expects his administration will look closely at safety — something the U.S. Food and Drug Administration already does before granting approval.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump’s comments came during an hour-long press conference where he hinted at trying to privatize the Postal Service and said he planned to file a lawsuit against a presidential preference poll published by The Des Moines Register that found him trailing Vice President Kamala Harris in the last days before the election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump, who will take the oath of office on Jan. 20, also said he would solve the war between Ukraine and Russia and establish the Middle East as a “good place,” though he declined to provide details.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Starting on day one, we&#8217;ll implement a rapid series of bold reforms to restore our nation to full prosperity,” Trump said in his first formal back-and-forth with reporters since the Nov. 5 election. “We&#8217;re going to go full prosperity and to build the greatest economy the world has ever seen, just as we had just a short time ago.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he expects Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the vaccine denier he has said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-taps-vaccine-skeptic-rfk-jr-lead-department-health-and-human-services" target="_blank">he will nominate&nbsp;</a>to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, will be “much less radical” than some people expect.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said Kennedy and others in his administration will file reports sharing what they think about vaccines, but didn’t say what actions might be taken after those reports are released.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he didn’t like the idea of mandating vaccines, but didn’t go as far as saying he’d change vaccine policy for parts of the federal government, like the Defense Department, which has numerous requirements for troops, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.military.com/off-duty/2020/02/10/why-most-dreaded-injection-called-peanut-butter-shot.html" target="_blank">the so-called peanut butter shot.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Kennedy is notorious for spreading misinformation about vaccine safety, one of the many issues that could imperil his attempts to garner U.S. Senate confirmation and actually lead HHS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he wanted this administration to look at why autism rates have increased in recent decades.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/autism-vaccine-link-debunked" target="_blank">Multiple research studies have debunked&nbsp;</a>any connections between vaccines and autism.</p>
<p dir="ltr">His administration, Trump said, would also look at ways to lower the costs of health care and prescription drugs within the United States, but he didn’t provide details.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Lawsuit threats</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump doubled down on his grievances with news organizations during the press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, saying he planned to file several lawsuits in the days and weeks ahead against people or organizations he believes have wronged him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The announcement came just days after Trump’s legal team&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/abc-trump-lawsuit-defamation-stephanopoulos-04aea8663310af39ae2a85f4c1a56d68" target="_blank">reached a settlement with ABC News</a> in which the news organization agreed to pay $15 million to Trump’s presidential library.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The suit centered on anchor George Stephanopoulos saying during an interview that a New York state jury had found Trump liable for the rape of writer E. Jean Carroll, when the jury had found him civilly liable for “sexual misconduct.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said during his press conference that he would likely file lawsuits against Iowa pollster J. Ann Selzer, the news show “60 Minutes” and the Pulitzer Prize organization for awards given to the New York Times and Washington Post.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In my opinion it was fraud and election interference,” he said of the Iowa Poll published by the Des Moines newspaper. “She&#8217;s got me right, always. She&#8217;s a very good pollster. She knows what she was doing, and she then quit before and we&#8217;ll probably be filing a major lawsuit against them today or tomorrow.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Selzer, a longtime pollster, said last week on Iowa PBS that she hadn’t yet figured out what went wrong with the poll she released just ahead of Election Day that showed Democratic presidential nominee Harris outperforming Trump in the state by 3 percentage points. Trump won Iowa in the election with 56% of the vote to her 42.7%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“There wasn&#8217;t anything that we saw that needed to be fixed. The reality is that more people supporting Donald Trump turned out,” she said. “I&#8217;m eagerly awaiting the secretary of state&#8217;s turnout reports that will happen in January to see what we can glean from that.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“But there wasn&#8217;t an adjustment to my data when we saw that it was going to be a shocker that I would have said okay, let&#8217;s adjust it. It&#8217;s not like I know ahead of time what the right numbers are going to be in the future. So, you kind of take the data designed to reveal to me our best shot at what the future is going to look like.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Selzer said during the PBS interview that she was “mystified” about allegations that she sought to interfere in the election results through the poll. Carol Hunter, executive editor of The Des Moines Register, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he also planned to sue the CBS News program “60 Minutes” over how it edited an interview with Harris that was released before the election.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He said he wants to sue the Pulitzer Prize organization&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staffs-new-york-times-and-washington-post" target="_blank">for awarding&nbsp;</a>staff at The New York Times and The Washington Post the national reporting award in 2018 for their reporting on “Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the President-elect’s transition team and his eventual administration.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I want them to take back the Pulitzer Prizes and pay big damages,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Pulitzer Prize Board&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/news/statement-pulitzer-prize-board-2" target="_blank">announced in July 2022</a> that it would not revoke the prizes in response to an inquiry from Trump and two independent reviews of the work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Both reviews were conducted by individuals with no connection to the institutions whose work was under examination, nor any connection to each other,” the board wrote. “The separate reviews converged in their conclusions: that no passages or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The 2018 Pulitzer Prizes in National Reporting stand.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Israel and Ukraine</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said during his press conference that he would address the ongoing Israel-Gaza war as well as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine once he takes office, but didn’t say exactly how he’d encourage those countries to end their conflicts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said he believed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is doing a “fantastic job” and said he thinks his second administration will be able to solve longstanding issues throughout the Middle East.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think the Middle East will be in a good place,” Trump said. “I think actually more difficult is going to be the Russia-Ukraine situation. I see that as more difficult.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has refused to leave the country’s borders. In the years since Russia launched a war, numerous organizations, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2022/10/un-commission-concludes-war-crimes-have-been-committed-ukraine-expresses" target="_blank">United Nations,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/11/ukraine-russian-strikes-amounting-to-war-crimes-continue-to-kill-and-injure-children/" target="_blank">Amnesty International</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/04/03/ukraine-apparent-war-crimes-russia-controlled-areas" target="_blank">Human Rights Watch</a> have all made allegations of war crimes against Russia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.state.gov/crimes-against-humanity-in-ukraine/" target="_blank">statement</a> in February 2023 that “Russia’s forces and other Russian officials have committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Russia, he wrote, had engaged in torture, rape, execution-style killings and “deported hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian civilians to Russia, including children who have been forcibly separated from their families.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump said during his press conference that he didn’t believe the Biden administration should have allowed Ukraine&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-ukraine-long-range-weapons-russia-52d424158182de2044ecc8bfcf011f9c" target="_blank">to shoot long-range missiles into Russia’s sovereign territory&nbsp;</a>and said he may reverse the policy once in office.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I thought it was a very stupid thing to do,” Trump said of the Biden administration’s policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the Israel-Hamas war, Trump declined to clarify exactly what he meant when he said there would be “hell to pay” if Hamas had not released the remaining hostages abducted in October 2023 before Trump took over the Oval Office. He simply added that it “would not be pleasant.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Postal Service, TikTok, primary challengers</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Trump left many questions about his agenda unanswered following the press conference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He declined to clarify whether he would press to privatize the U.S. Postal Service, saying only that there was “talk” about severing the agency and that his team is “looking at that.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He didn’t divulge whether his administration would seek to force social media giant TikTok to divest from its Chinese parent company if it wants to remain operational within the United States. TikTok on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/federal-appeals-court-upholds-rapidly-approaching-tiktok-ban" target="_blank">an appeals court order</a> preserving a bipartisan law forcing ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, to cease operations in the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’ll take a look at that,” Trump said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He left open supporting Republican primary challenges against GOP senators who don’t support his nominees to lead federal departments and agencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A senator voting against one of his nominees “for political reasons or stupid reasons” would likely earn them a primary challenger, he said. But Trump added that wouldn&#8217;t have anything to do with him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump also declined to say whether he expected Chinese leader Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration after extending an invitation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If he&#8217;d like to come, I&#8217;d love to have him, but there&#8217;s been nothing much discussed,” Trump said. “I have had discussions with him, letters, etc, etc, at a very high level. You know, we had a very good relationship until COVID. COVID didn&#8217;t end the relationship, but it was a bridge too far for me.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump then added he believes Xi is “an amazing person.”</p>

Glenn Youngkin serves coffee to patrons at McLean's Restaurant in Richmond after announcing a "no-tax-on-tips" budget proposal on Dec. 16, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin served more than pancakes and coffee at McLean’s Restaurant in Richmond Monday morning. He also unveiled another key part of his budget proposal: eliminating state taxes on tipped employees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describing the measure as a “foundational piece” of his budget, which he is expected to present before a joint meeting of the legislature’s money committees on Wednesday, Youngkin emphasized the need to ease financial pressures, stating “It is time for us to reduce tax burdens on hard working Virginians.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 250,000 people working in food service and hospitality could see tax relief under the plan, according to the Virginia Department of Taxation and the Virginia Employment Commission. Tipped workers would be able to claim a deduction on their state tax returns, with compliance ensured through IRS data and employer-reported W-2 information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal must still get approval from the General Assembly as lawmakers and the governor work toward an amended biennial state budget during the upcoming legislative session, which begins in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is running for governor in 2025 and joined Youngkin at the announcement, expressed optimism about the policy, suggesting that Virginia could be the first state to implement such a measure if approved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think this should be bipartisan,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the leading Democrat in the state Senate who chairs the finance committee, did not have a comment at the time of this publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s push to eliminate state taxes on tips mirrors discussions at the federal level, where the idea gained traction during the fall campaign season. Both President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris floated similar proposals, and </span><a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/08/13/horsford-announces-bill-to-make-sure-high-end-earners-cant-exploit-an-end-to-tax-on-tips/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">related bills</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been introduced </span><a href="https://www.taxnotes.com/research/federal/legislative-documents/proposed-legislation/s-4621-no-tax-tips-act/7kgn8" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Congress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While eliminating taxes on tips might seem like a clear win for workers, the policy’s broader impact remains uncertain. Economists have raised concerns that some employers could exploit the measure by shifting more of a worker’s compensation to tips rather than wages, a possibility also </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/trump-and-harris-say-theyll-kill-taxes-on-tips-how-would-that-work" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as similar  national legislation has been filed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asked about this concern, Youngkin acknowledged variations across the food service industry. “It depends, of course, on the establishment,” he said. “But, we see a substantial portion of our waiters and waitresses earnings in the form of tips, and this is a great way for us to say that ‘You keep that money.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the preview of his upcoming budget presentation on Wednesday, Youngkin also announced </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/youngkin-wants-to-restrict-funding-for-localities-that-dont-comply-with-immigration-enforcement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to cut funding to localities that limit or refuse compliance with U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal aligns with a broader GOP-led national movement to counter “sanctuary city” policies. These policies vary but often involve local governments opting not to ask about an individual&#8217;s immigration status or refusing to fully cooperate with ICE. However, with Virginia’s legislature under Democratic control, the proposal is likely to face significant resistance during the upcoming budget negotiations. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sapone also called for a formal memorandum of understanding between OSIG and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Department of Corrections to establish coordination procedures for investigations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Alexandria, a member of the Corrections Oversight Committee, said that he and other lawmakers are frequently  contacted by incarcerated people and their families seeking assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He emphasized that while it may be tempting for lawmakers to intervene directly in complaints it is crucial to forward the information to the ombudsman to ensure a proper investigation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know, you hear compelling stories that may or may not be true and we need to regulate ourselves to make sure that our role is to oversee the ombudsman’s office and not get engaged in individual cases,” Marsden said. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">People in Red Onion State Prison relay poor conditions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An investigation into living conditions and treatment of inmates at Red Onion State Prison is what some lawmakers, prison reform advocates and loved ones of people incarcerated there have been calling for in recent weeks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of Thanksgiving, Department of Corrections Director Chad Dotson confirmed that six incarcerated individuals had intentionally </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/virginia-department-of-corrections-confirm-inmates-burned-themselves-lawmakers-want-investigation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">burned themselves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He said that they received medical treatment and were referred to mental health services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The confirmation came after the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus (VLBC) urged Dotson and Gov. Glenn Youngkin to investigate. The caucus, which had been contacted by families of those incarcerated, suggested the self-harm incidents were acts of protests against prison conditions or efforts to prompt transfers to other facilities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Red Onion has also seen hunger strikes, with inmates citing  poor living conditions and food, mistreatment,racism by some correctional officers and the excessive use of solitary confinement, according to the caucus </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, the caucus said the hunger strike and the self-harm “reflect the psychological and physical toll that gruesome prison conditions can have on incarcerated individuals.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Dotson confirmed that at least six people at the prison had harmed themselves, he said they did so by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“tampering with electrical outlets.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dotson dismissed reports from the prison as “bad-faith efforts to try to score cheap political points by advocacy groups.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also accused these groups of pushing for “prison abolition and policies that would make Virginians less safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ekong Eshiet, who is incarcerated at Red Onion, has recently expressed concerns about his safety. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allegedly among those who engaged in self-harm, Eshiet was contacted by The Mercury through JPay, a service that allows incarcerated people to communicate with those who are outside the prison. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He suggested reaching out to his sister, who did not respond to calls or messages before this article’s publication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prison Radio, an organization that amplifies the voices of incarcerated individuals, has released an </span><a href="https://www.prisonradio.org/commentary/hunger-strike-and-self-immolation-update/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">audio recording of Eshiet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In the recording he recounts facing discrimination due to his name and Muslim faith and described the challenges he encountered during his personal hunger strike. He also spoke openly about setting himself on fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eshiet described his situation as being “in fear for my life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expressing his hope for a transfer to another facility to serve the remainder of his  sentence, Eshiet said, “I’m trying to get up off this. I’m doing my best, like I’m going about this the right way. I guess, like with the hunger strike way. But if I have to, I don’t mind setting myself on fire again.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, the situation seems like “a cry for help.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean something has to be going on, right?” she said in an interview with The Mercury. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the VLBC, Favola has been working to uncover more information about potential issues within the prison. Earlier in November, she and Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, sent a letter to Dotson, requesting a detailed report after families of inmates shared troubling anecdotes about conditions at Red Onion and another facility, Wallens Ridge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t say that I have any evidence to point specific fingers at,” Favola said. However, she expressed hope that the newly established ombudsman position will facilitate  a thorough investigation into the matter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, the VLBC chair, told The Mercury that he and his colleagues are still “gathering intel”on the conditions at Red Onion. As the caucus prepares to unveil its legislative priorities ahead of the upcoming General Assembly session, Bagby suggested that continued prison reform efforts may be among the initiatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB719" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to regulate the duration a person can spend in solitary confinement. Although Virginia law refers to the practice as “restorative housing,” concerns about its excessive use have been raised by lawmakers and reform advocates. The measure passed the Democratic-controlled legislature earlier this year but was ultimately </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+SB719AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill would have mandated  mental health evaluations every two days for individuals in solitary confinement and built on a related reform </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+sum+SB887" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">signed into law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Youngkin last year. That earlier legislation requires that people in solitary confinement receive a designated number of hours outside their cells each day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his veto message for the 2024 bill, Youngkin described the measure as “unnecessary bureaucracy” that would burden facility administrators and hinder the department’s focus on “safety and inmate rehabilitation.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Renewed hope’</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, prison reform advocates, incarcerated individuals and their families continue to speak out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the recent Corrections Oversight Committee meeting, several people used the public comment period to share concerns about the conditions their loved ones have reported. They urged lawmakers to visit the prisons firsthand and called for thorough investigations into the issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kimberly Dyke-Harsley El shared that a family member, currently incarcerated at Greensville Correctional Center, went several days without access to his blood pressure medication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, Gigi Badawi recounted spending over a year navigating back-and-forth communications with the Department of Corrections to ensure necessary medication for her son at Indian Creek Correctional Center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And activist Phil Wilayto called on  lawmakers to investigate  the allegations emerging from  Red Onion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s time for those of us who have advocated for our incarcerated loved ones to be taken seriously instead of immediately dismissed,” Badawi said. “I have renewed hope that the new ombudsman and her team will look into allegations.”</span></p>

(Photo by Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — The form to apply for federal financial student aid must roll out by Oct. 1 annually after President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-passes-bill-move-annual-fafsa-release-deadline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a bill into law</a> Wednesday that ensures an earlier processing cycle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Though the <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/feds-roll-out-2025-26-college-financial-aid-form-ahead-planned-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Application for Federal Student Aid</a>, or FAFSA, typically launches in October each year, the U.S. Department of Education legally had until Jan. 1 to make the form available.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new law came as the department has taken heat over its <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gaps-fafsa-rollout-are-closing-watchdog-tells-us-house-panel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">botched rollout</a> of the 2024-25 form, when users faced a series of glitches and errors. The form did not officially launch until January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adding fuel to the fire, the agency announced earlier this year that it would take a staggered approach to the 2025-26 form so it could address problems that might pop up before opening applications to everyone — again making the form available later than usual.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-department-education-begins-testing-new-fafsa-form" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing stages</a> that began Oct. 1, the department fully debuted the 2025-26 form in late November — 10 days ahead of its Dec. 1 official launch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A spokesperson for the department said it is “committed to enforcing all laws duly passed by Congress” when asked about Biden signing the FAFSA bill into law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the department said Thursday it had received over 1.5 million 2025-26 FAFSA submissions and has delivered more than 7 million student records to states and schools.</p>
<p dir="ltr">U.S. Under Secretary of Education James Kvaal said that even with these developments, the department’s work “is not done.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We will continue to fix bugs and improve the user experience to make it easier for students and families to get the financial aid they need,” Kvaal said on a call with reporters Thursday regarding updates on the 2025-26 form.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">FAFSA deadline bill breezed through Congress</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was met with sweeping bipartisan support and swiftly passed both the House and Senate in November. Indiana GOP Rep. Erin Houchin, a member of the U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce, introduced the legislation in July.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sen. Bill Cassidy, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, put forth the Senate version of the bill. The Louisiana Republican is in line to chair the panel next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rep. Bobby Scott, ranking member of the House education panel, celebrated the bill becoming law on Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“As college costs continue to rise, federal financial aid, including Pell Grants, is essential to making higher education more affordable and accessible,” the Virginia Democrat said in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Scott said that by standardizing the deadline, the measure “gives students and families more time to complete their applications and secure the financial support they need to attend college without unnecessary delays.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The 2024-25 application got a makeover after Congress passed the FAFSA Simplification Act in late 2020 but was met with several issues that prompted processing delays and gaps in submissions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The department’s staff worked to fix these errors and close the gap in submissions from the previous processing cycle, and officials said they reflected on how to make improvements for the 2025-26 form and beyond. </p>

(Ned Oliver/ Virginia Mercury)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, East is East, and West is West and ne’er the twain shall meet,</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Till Earth and sky stand presently at God’s great Judgment Seat.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">                           —</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rudyard Kipling, “The Ballad of East and West”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When this century began a generation ago, did you imagine that you’d see a time when one political party would refer to its opposition party as “the enemies of the people?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you think you’d see someone accused of gunning down an executive on a Manhattan sidewalk by shooting him in the back celebrated as a hero on social media?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, here we are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is an interesting microcosm of a nation fast cleaving itself into hostile tribes, ideologically, culturally and — perhaps most troubling — geographically. It’s playing out before us in our politics, our policy and how we relate to one another. Or, better yet, don’t relate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither side in our widening cultural schism is willing to consider the other’s point of view. We are hardened by the echo chamber of social media and ideologically driven cable channels and podcasts to the point that losers resort to violence to keep or gain power. Those trend lines, taken to their conclusion, threaten to derail the governing structure of a freely elected republic now almost 250 years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free, democratic societies are not immune from political disagreement. Rather, they feed on it. Unlike autocracies, we quarrel openly and enact policy through debate and compromise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nor are democracies static. Things change; sometimes,  as is the case in Virginia,  at a glacial pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sixty years ago, rural Virginia — in a time when farming, factories and coal mines still dominated the state’s economy — ruled politics. Governors and House speakers were routinely from places like the Southwest, Southside or the Valley. The state as a whole was still loyal to a Democratic Party that had championed racially segregated schools under its legally and morally bankrupt “Massive Resistance” doctrine. But Democratic control was slipping as the party morphed into today’s socially liberal party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then came the upheavals of 1968 and Richard Nixon’s “Southern Strategy” which cynically leveraged white restiveness in the former Confederate states against rights Black Americans gained with the dismantling of Jim Crow, flipping the South irretrievably from Democratic to Republican in one four-year cycle. Virginia Republicans the next year broke the stranglehold Democrats had on state government since Reconstruction by electing Linwood Holton governor. Since then, both parties have intermittently swapped power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia would vote Republican in presidential elections for 40 years until Barack Obama won the state’s 13 electoral votes in 2008. It has remained solidly Democratic in every presidential election since, including the one a few weeks ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the way, we lost something. A lot, actually. And we’re poorer for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News media are diminished to the point where professional, vetted reporting is no longer how most </span><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2024/10/10/where-americans-turn-for-election-news/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">voters get their information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s a complicated dynamic in which the financial and concomitant editorial atrophy of legacy print and broadcast journalism gets swamped by the unchecked proliferation of social media platforms, podcasts and cable stations where lies commonly go unrebutted even as verifiable fact struggles to be heard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not that major newspapers and the once-unchallenged networks were sacrosanct. Far from it; they were quite human. We made mistakes. (I certainly did.) We got things wrong, but the process was sufficiently transparent that errors were promptly and publicly corrected and the reporters and editors responsible were held accountable for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, conspiracy fabulists run wild, misinforming and disinforming with impunity. They blast a firehose of disinformation that would rightly be dismissed as really bad science fiction in a more rational past, yet it finds an audience among the willfully gullible. For instance, enough people believe there are machines that control the weather that</span> <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2024/12/03/florida-ileana-garcia-weather-modification-chemtrails/76728150007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation is pending in Florida</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to ban such a device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The past half century has seen the rise of political professionals who have made campaigns into data-driven science, turned groups of Americans against one another for political gain, knocked down</span> <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=64d6e991925efab70c3a9fc17c5590612d4d22450b9471c2429d9cfd3bf567aeJmltdHM9MTczMzg3NTIwMA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=4&amp;fclid=37df83b0-0435-6d9c-15d4-96b205326c44&amp;psq=campaign+finance+citizens+united&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJlbm5hbmNlbnRlci5vcmcvb3VyLXdvcmsvcmVzZWFyY2gtcmVwb3J0cy9jaXRpemVucy11bml0ZWQtZXhwbGFpbmVk&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislative walls</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intended to keep plutocrats from stealthily buying public offices and now rake in rock-star fees for practicing their dark arts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no ethical bottom to today’s victory </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">über alles</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electioneering and the just-finished election makes plain. But it delivers results, so don’t expect it to go away or even lighten up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Politics as it is now done fails us by exploiting and exacerbating cultural differences that a big country or commonwealth such as ours should not just tolerate but celebrate. And its practitioners are content to keep us suspicious and grudgeful of one another — the better to manipulate us every November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re losing — if we haven’t already lost — the ability to reason among ourselves because we can’t agree on established facts where such a dialogue would begin. Much of society seems untethered to standards of decency and human empathy that once made ours a civil society. </span><a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/12/11/altoona-police-mcdonalds-threats-luigi-mangione-arrest/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Threats</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been made against those involved in apprehending the</span> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/unitedhealthcare-suspect-ceo-assassin-shooter-b5ff640798d799271ddd8db9f3d2a20e" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alleged assassin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson at an Altoona, Pennsylvania, McDonald’s — that shows how low we’ve sunk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the geography of the schism is easy to follow. It shows up in crimson and blue maps after every election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crescent of suburban wealth — that loops loosely from Loudoun County and the Washington, D.C., bedroom communities south along Interstate 95 through commuter country to the affluent clusters around Richmond and then southeast down the Peninsula to Hampton Roads — is largely center-left and leans toward Democrats. They’re largely college-educated, two-income households whose kids attend well-funded schools and tend to be more socially liberal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">West and south of there are vast, often sparse populations in rural areas whose fortunes took a beating since the 1990s. Global trade agreements moved furniture and textile jobs offshore. Litigation against cigarette makers crippled tobacco farming and processing. Clean-air mandates, driven by climate science, undermined the coal industry that once brought decent wages to the corner of Virginia the farthest from the suburban crescent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people with their conservative beliefs feel — and not without justification — that their communities and values are being ridiculed by comfortable elites in cozy subdivisions … well, you can see how it wouldn’t take much for those hard feelings to grow and ossify.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are differences that the long passage of time may or may not assuage. But the lack of communication we have here is untenable. It will eventually corrode our very ability to govern ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forget about agreeing on everything. The first step is realizing that nobody has his or her way all the time, no matter how convinced you might be that yours is the only way. We must at least </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">hear</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one another again, understand what the other guys are saying and even acknowledge from time to time that they may have a point. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kipling’s paradigm about a perpetually separate east and west is not an option, certainly not in Virginia.</span></p>

(Courtesy of Luther Cifers campaign). </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luther Cifers, a businessman from Prince Edward County, emerged victorious in the Republican nomination contest for Virginia’s 10th Senate District during a mass meeting at the Goochland Rec Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting, which drew hundreds of Republican voters, began Friday evening and stretched into the early hours of Saturday as participants navigated a lengthy multi-ballot process to select a nominee from a crowded field of seven candidates. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cifers secured the majority needed to clinch the nomination, defeating a mix of seasoned politicians and newcomers in three rounds of voting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cifers will now face Democrat Jack Trammel in the Jan. 7 special election to fill the vacancy left by Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, who resigned after his recent election to Congress. The winner of the special election will serve the remainder of McGuire’s term, which runs until 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other contenders included runner-up Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors who previously ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but was defeated by McGuire​, and Amanda Chase, a former state senator from Chesterfield County who served in the Virginia Senate for eight years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were four other bids for the seat by Shayne Snavely, a veteran and former Chase aide, Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser, Alex Cheatham, a recent college graduate, and Bryan Hamlet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Luther emerged from a field of seven outstanding candidates who sought the nomination. The Republican Party of Virginia and I look forward to marching in lockstep with Luther and his team over the next three weeks in ensuring that he is victorious on January 7th and takes the oath of office on January 8th,” said Rich Anderson, the chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the district’s strong Republican lean — with 62.8% of voters supporting former President Donald Trump and 67.8% backing Gov. Glenn Youngkin — Cifers is seen as the favorite in the upcoming election.</span></p>

When her son experienced a trauma this past summer, a local mobile crisis unit was able to provide immediate counseling and connect the family to follow-up mental health resources. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><i>Editor’s note: The Mercury is not identifying the name of Asheley Tuck&#8217;s son to protect the child&#8217;s identity. Tuck&#8217;s statements were substantiated through interviews with mental health professionals with knowledge of her family&#8217;s situation. </i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With books, toys and artwork strewn about, Asheley Tuck’s son’s room is the typical sort one might expect from an 11-year-old boy. What is less typical: a piece of notebook paper taped to his door labeled “safety plan.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The paper outlines how sudden mood shifts, loss of interests, isolation or a racing heart could be warning signs of anxiety, so that he can better recognize when an attack might be coming on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuck’s son also has notes that outline techniques — like listing types of Pokemon in alphabetical order — which can help him cope with swelling negative emotions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The notes are relics from crisis response and follow-up counseling he received this past summer after he and some friends encountered an online predator during a sleepover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tuck said that she and her wife didn’t know how to best comfort their son when he called to be picked up from the sleepover and confided in them what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(The person) scared them and asked them to do some things that were not appropriate for anyone, much less, you know, an 11-year-old,” Tuck said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her son expressed feeling like “his life was ruined” and he was worried he would be “plastered on the internet and what the repercussions would be,” Tuck recalled. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He was devastated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having known people who were social workers, Tuck realized she could call Richmond’s Crisis Response and Stabilization Team (CReST). Within less than an hour, a clinician arrived at their house to provide immediate counseling to the family. After the initial visit, CReST arranged follow-up visits for a few weeks and referred the family to additional counseling services if needed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fact that he got services that quickly was a game changer for how he&#8217;ll be able to navigate his life going forward,” Tuck said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the clinician who responded to Tuck’s son was part of CReST through the Richmond Behavioral Health Authority, there are similar programs around Virginia, colloquially referred to as mobile crisis units. These professionals and teams are part of Virginia’s ever-expanding landscape of mental health resources and have played a role in keeping patients in their homes rather than hospitals or, in escalated cases, jails.</span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erin DeLizzio, a program manager at CReST, explained that while some staff are located in the downtown Richmond office, others have take-home cars to be dispatched from around the region, from Hanover to Farmville to Emporia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that her area, Region 4, was able to provide services to over 1,500 people in the 2024 fiscal year. Most of those people were diverted from hospitals and jails and were able to get help at their homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve got to be able to meet people where they are,” said Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a longtime champion for bolstering mental health resources in Virginia who supported the 2021 legislation that paved the way for mobile crisis units and other services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CReST’s responses to calls for help can range from de-escalating situations over the phone to dispatching clinicians to meet with people directly. Sometimes patients need immediate counseling and connections to follow-up resources like therapists or psychiatrists. Sometimes they might need to be admitted to crisis receiving centers — which operate like emergency rooms in hospitals, but focus on mental health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clinicians can be dispatched when people call the regional mobile crisis line directly or when routed through emergency calls to 911 or 988, a national mental health crisis hotline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the national mental health emergency hotline transitioned to the easier-to-remember 988 system, Virginia </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0248" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2021 funded expanded call centers and listed the deployment of mobile crisis units as part of 988’s responsibilities. The service has been </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/09/25/virginia-988-hotline-mental-health-crisis" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on the rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Virginia, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin has said he sees as a success because it means people are connected to resources before a crisis can escalate further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s three-year </span><a href="https://www.hhr.virginia.gov/12-14-2022-Two-Page-BH-Plan-Summary.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Help, Right Now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plan entails budget proposals from the governor and legislative actions by state lawmakers focused on mental health care. Youngkin recently celebrated the two year anniversary of the initiative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right Help, Right Now is working,” he declared excitedly at a press conference on the two year anniversary of the initiative, Dec. 11. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The initiative’s bipartisan efforts build on a decade’s worth of work spearheaded by Deeds and the Behavioral Health Commission he helped establish. Outside of legislative sessions, the commission undertakes studies and hears from experts around the state to craft or endorse legislation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent years have seen new solutions born from local tragedies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bill dubbed “Irvo’s Law” allows families access to their loved one if they are taken into custody by law enforcement during a crisis. Its inspiration stemmed from the death of Henrico resident Irvo Otineo, who died in a mental health hospital while constrained by law enforcement officers and staff, and whose mother was denied access to him there.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 law called the “</span><a href="https://dbhds.virginia.gov/human-resource-development-and-management/health-equity/mdpa/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marcus Alert</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” stems from the death of Richmond resident Marcus-David Peters, who was killed by police in 2018 during a mental health crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a growing number of Virginia localities implement the law, it enables coordination between 911 and regional call centers to triage the best response from law enforcement and trained clinicians when handling mental health situations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A main goal is to not hospitalize someone if we can,” said Abigayle Hodges, a mobile crisis unit team leader at CReST. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, law enforcement officers are the first responders to crises and  escort people to hospitals where they sit waiting with them. Other times, people may be subject to emergency custody orders, which is when a magistrate orders that someone needs to be evaluated by health professionals because they could be a harm to themselves or others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consensus has been building between some lawmakers and members of law enforcement that officers and deputies aren’t always the best people to take point or remain with people in crises for longer periods of time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not only should there be less police interactions with someone who’s going through a crisis, but when you’re looking at rural areas such as the county where I’m from and small police departments throughout the region, then taking just one person off patrol can hurt a community,” said Tazewell County Sheriff Brian Hieatt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent </span><a href="https://bhc.virginia.gov/documents/BHC%20Staff%20-%20ABLEO.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Virginia’s Behavioral Health Commission also noted how arrests of people in mental health crises have a “devastating impact” on those in crisis and that it can “stress local and state resources.” People in crisis can also be more prone to lashing out and assaulting an officer, regardless of their coherence or intent, and end up facing jail time as a result. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his forthcoming budget presentation for 2025, Youngkin hopes that $35 million can be invested into creating “</span><a href="https://www.dcjs.virginia.gov/licensure-and-regulatory-affairs/special-conservators-peace" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Special Conservators of the Peace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” he said this week. These are both armed and unarmed positions authorized by courts to carry out limited law enforcement duties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While resources like 988 and mobile crisis units can help prevent people from going to the hospital, Youngkin believes the conservators can help improve the outcomes of those who are taken to hospitals by law enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Officers) are brought into many of these circumstances that not only distract them from so many other responsibilities, but then have an individual who&#8217;s in crisis enter the criminal justice system unnecessarily — we need to address both of those,” Youngkin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While state lawmakers will still need to collaborate with Youngkin throughout the first few months of 2025 to decide how the state’s budget will be allocated, Youngkin sees the conservator program as a temporary solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We should see a reduction in hospital admittance, and therefore a reduction in the law enforcement needs around the hospital,” Youngkin said. “But for the time being, having our cops in place that allow this transfer of custody is really important.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anna Czaplicki Ryan, a program supervisor at CReST, described how some transfer of care is already happening between law enforcement and clinicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A ‘warm handoff’ is the terminology we use,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CReST staff and law enforcement already have some experience working together in instances where police are at the scene of an emergency first and ask for assistance or for clinicians to take over care, Czaplicki Ryan explained. When officers and clinicians demonstrate the transfer of care to patients, it can help them feel supported and know they are “not abandoned.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deeds, who serves on the Senate’s finance committee, said that he’s “fine with” Youngkin’s conservator proposal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just think that our focus should not necessarily be on the moment of crisis,” Deeds said. “Our focus also needs to be on prevention, on keeping people out of crisis.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Asheley Tuck, whose son experienced a trauma, she said that she’s glad she knew that 988 and CReST existed in their moment of need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If a friend had not mentioned that this program exists, I may not have known about it at all,” she said. “I think it should be regular public knowledge.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Video of Illinois police officer’s DUI arrest in Virginia likely to remain private</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efforts to obtain video footage of an Illinois police official’s DUI arrest in Virginia have been repeatedly denied, despite multiple public records requests, the national news network Patch </span><a href="https://patch.com/illinois/burrridge/burr-ridge-cops-arrest-video-kept-secret-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported Wednesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ryan Husarik, formerly the deputy police chief of Burr Ridge, Illinois, was arrested on April 15 in Northern Virginia while attending the FBI National Academy. He was driving a police car with a reported blood-alcohol level 2.5 times the legal limit, according to Virginia State Police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite multiple public records requests since April, Patch has been unable to obtain the video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burr Ridge Police released the Virginia police report obtained through an internal investigation but declined to release the video footage, citing an Illinois law that exempts records related to a public body&#8217;s adjudication of employee discipline. Had the arrest occurred in Illinois, the video would likely have been subject to the state’s Freedom of Information Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patch then requested the video from Virginia State Police, but the agency denied access, stating the footage was part of a closed criminal investigation. Virginia’s public records law, which is more restrictive than Illinois’, allows police to withhold such materials at their discretion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, a Patch reporter in Virginia filed a similar request, as Virginia’s public records law sometimes grants greater access to state residents. However, Virginia State Police again denied the request, citing the closed case exemption. The agency stated that its decision applied to all related documents, including the police report.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Megan Rhyne, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Open Government, told Patch that the law does not prohibit the release of the video but allows police discretion in withholding it. “The only way to pry it loose after repeated denials that are unfortunately allowed under existing law is to challenge the denial in court,” Rhyne said in an email to Patch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video could provide insight into whether Husarik invoked his status as a police officer during the arrest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the incident, Husarik, who was earning $150,000 annually at the time, was suspended for 40 days without pay until July 26. He was later demoted to sergeant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar"> The Mercury’s efforts to track FOIA and other transparency cases in Virginia are indebted to the work of the</span><a href="https://www.opengovva.org/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Coalition for Open Government</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a nonprofit alliance dedicated to expanding access to government records, meetings and other state and local proceedings. </div>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">UVA Audit Committee reviews health system oversight amid employee allegations</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors Audit, Compliance, and Risk Committee has reviewed its 2024 fiscal audit, focusing on financial oversight at the UVA Medical Center and ongoing investigations into leadership misconduct allegations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The session was mostly closed to the public, with members consulting Washington, D.C.-based legal firm Williams &amp; Connolly, </span><a href="https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2024/12/audit-compliance-and-risk-committee-reviews-school-of-medicine-investigation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to a report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by The Cavalier Daily, the university’s newspaper. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The committee is investigating claims from 128 employees of the UVA Physicians Group, who accused UVA Health CEO Craig Kent and School of Medicine Dean Melina Kibbe of administrative misconduct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financially, the university&#8217;s net position rose by $757 million, driven by a $403 million increase in patient services and $593.5 million in investment income. Vice President for Finance Augie Maurelli highlighted a 50% reduction in unresolved audit “management points” from last year, with three new points bringing the current total to six.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Rasnic, director of higher education audit programs, discussed financial control issues at the Medical Center stemming from the 2021 acquisition of UVA Community Health. He cited a “historic [structure] of inadequate design controls,” adding that “a lack of supporting documentation paired with management override of controls create risks for error and fraud.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rasnic further revealed that the Medical Center failed to reconcile bank statements for nine months, resulting in $30 million in overpayments and $60 million in unrecorded wire transfers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The audit recommended improved oversight of service providers, stronger interdepartmental communications, better student loan reporting, and enhanced firewall security. It also highlighted the creation of UVA’s first Director of Privacy Programs, set to be hired in early 2025.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ongoing audits include an NCAA-mandated review of intercollegiate athletics revenue and expense reporting, expected by February 2025, as well as the inclusion of UVA’s financial aid audit in Virginia’s broader Single Audit review of federal fund use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Audit Committee will reconvene at the next Board of Visitors meeting in March.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Misconduct probe prompts mandatory training for Hanover High baseball team</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover County Public Schools (HCPS) has completed its investigation into reports of misconduct within the Hanover High baseball program, which remains suspended. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, HCPS announced that mandatory training for players and coaches would take place as part of efforts to address the issues, the Richmond Times-Dispatch </span><a href="https://richmond.com/sports/high-school/baseball/hanover-high-school-baseball-program-misconduct-investigation-hawks/article_a8dd668e-b81c-11ef-85fc-ef3994bd4061.html#tracking-source=home-top-story" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HCPS spokesperson Chris Whitley confirmed that the investigation was “comprehensive” but said specific details, including any disciplinary action or the job status of coach Tyler Kane, could not be shared due to privacy laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a letter to families and staff, HCPS outlined three key areas for improvement: increased supervision, clearer communication of expectations, and additional training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To support this, the program will collaborate with A Better Way Athletics, a third-party vendor specializing in athletics management. The organization will provide required training for all players and coaches, with any team member or coach who misses the initial session required to complete it before resuming activities. “The training from A Better Way Athletics will support our efforts to help ensure that the program is one where all students feel safe, respected, and supported,” Whitley said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Better Way Athletics, based in North Chesterfield, offers courses on topics like managing conflict and engaging officials, aiming to “minimize risk,” “create alignment,” and “cultivate growth.” Clients include schools from across the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the training, HCPS expects to resume off-season baseball activities after winter break, which runs from Dec. 23 to Jan. 3, according to The Times-Dispatch. Whitley said that no school-sanctioned practices have occurred during the suspension.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hanover County Sheriff’s Office confirmed it received a report in October related to the investigation but did not pursue it as the family involved did not want law enforcement involvement. “It is a school matter and has nothing to do with the Sheriff&#8217;s Office,” said Sgt. Steven Wills.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a dangerous trend, perhaps attributable to the bleats of vaccine deniers who elevate misinformation, emotion and quackery over science.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some adults may be unaware of past scourges where children frequently became ill before vaccines were available. Many decades ago, polio sufferers had to depend on metal apparatuses called</span> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1047691984/decades-after-polio-martha-is-among-the-last-to-still-rely-on-an-iron-lung-to-br" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iron lungs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just to help them breathe. Today, because of vaccines, polio is</span> <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/An-important-moment-in-the-fight-against-polio" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly eradicated worldwide</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and iron lungs are primarily an eerie part of my youthful subconscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccines work. More Americans should know that fact. Refusal of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic,</span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250123" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">often along partisan lines</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, makes the current challenge tougher.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2024/11/20/school-vaccine-exemptions-virginia" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axios Richmond</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently noted the number of parents in Virginia now opting out of getting their children vaccinated. It reported the percentage of kindergartners with vaccine exemptions has quadrupled over the past 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC statistics show 2.4%, or about 2,050 children out of 85,374 kindergartners in the commonwealth, had either medical or nonmedical vaccine exemptions in the 2023-24 school year. In 2014, that figure was 0.6%. (Nonmedical exemptions often involve religious reasons, though I suspect parents often cite them merely to refuse the injections.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s rate of exemptions was still below the national average of 3.3%, Axios reported. Parents nationwide also overwhelmingly support childhood vaccinations,</span> <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/05/16/americans-largely-positive-views-of-childhood-vaccines-hold-steady/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to the Pew Research Center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those positive facts could be altered, however, because</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/03/nx-s1-5198506/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-chd-lawsuits" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is set to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under President-elect Donald Trump. Kennedy is a prominent anti-vaxxer and has been criticized as a</span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/12/10/rfk-jr-faces-trouble-in-the-senate-00193579" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“denier of science.”</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s another example of Trump</span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/the-scandal-of-trumps-cabinet-picks-isnt-just-their-personal-failings" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">using his picks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to undermine the health and safety of everyday Americans, while at the same time awarding his sycophants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccine refusal disturbs epidemiologists like Carrie Dolan, an associate professor of kinesiology and public health at William &amp; Mary. She said the benefits of vaccines far, far outweigh the risks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They’re effective,” Dolan told me. “They’re safe. They’re reliable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people aren’t vaccinated, she added, the chance for an infected person to spread a contagious disease to someone else increases. Getting a little wonky – at least for me – Dolan explained something called an</span><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“R0,” or basic reproduction number</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Measles has an R0 of 12 to 18, meaning one infected person could spread it to up to 18 others in an unvaccinated population, she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before the vaccine, measles caused widespread outbreaks, often leading to complications like pneumonia and, in rare cases, brain swelling,” Dolan said by email. “Thanks to vaccination programs, measles cases have been drastically reduced worldwide. However, when vaccination rates drop, outbreaks can quickly return.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whooping cough, or pertussis, has an R0 of 12–17 and is especially dangerous for infants, who can have severe coughing fits that make breathing difficult. “Vaccination has greatly reduced the risk,” she said, but without it, “this disease could spread more easily, putting vulnerable groups like babies and the elderly at greater risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccinations also help protect children who, paradoxically, can’t take them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. John Harrington, a general pediatrician at Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, told me that young oncology patients chronically on steroids are “unlikely to mount a response” to certain vaccines. In those instances, vaccines could be harmful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The assumption is if everybody else is vaccinated, that protects” children with serious health problems, Harrington said. (This is also another way to define</span><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22599-herd-immunity" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">herd immunity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vaccine-hesitant parents tend to have heard or seen things on the internet or social media that influence their thinking, he said. Many, though, are willing to listen to their pediatricians or primary care physicians about the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective, even if the total risk can’t be ruled out. Children are more likely to be protected, though, from diseases than if they hadn’t gotten the shots, Harrington said.</span></p>

		<div class="newsroomBlockQuoteAuthorContainer">
		<p style="font-size:13px"><b>– Erica Hunter, immunization data and outreach manager in the Virginia Department of Health</b></p>
	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Erica Hunter, immunization data and outreach manager in the Virginia Department of Health,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">told me the recent trends on refusing vaccines for young children “certainly raise concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most Virginians do vaccinate their children,” Hunter said, adding she had no information on what role vaccine denialism might have in contributing to the statistics. “We just try to provide the best and most accurate information we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noted the state’s Vaccines for Children program provides free immunizations and has done so for decades. “These viruses have not gone anywhere,” Hunter said. “They can resurface when vaccination rates decline.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Non-COVID outbreaks have occurred in Virginia from time to time. For example, since June 2022,</span><a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/surveillance-and-investigation/meningococcal-disease-outbreak-response/" target="_blank"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">41 confirmed cases</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of meningococcal disease associated with an outbreak of a specific bacterium have occurred. It killed eight people of all ages.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nationwide, 283 measles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cases were reported this year through Dec. 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Virginia had one reported case. Some 89% of the total cases were listed as unvaccinated or unknown.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not vaccinating children exasperates Dolan, the Willam &amp; Mary epidemiologist. She helps run an immunization project in Kenya, and this summer, she had just 14 vaccines to fight HPV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some 300 girls sought the precious supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In America, she said, we forget how lucky we are to have access to vaccines. “It’s been weaponized politically,” Dolan noted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please vaccinate your children. Your actions will protect them and may help others, too.</span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaks at an early vote rally in Chesterfield on Oct. 26, 2024. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahead of his annual budget presentation to lawmakers next week, Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Thursday announced a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/embargo-dec-12.pdf">proposal</a> to block state funding from any locality implementing a “sanctuary city” policy and “refusing to comply with federal law to deport” undocumented immigrants who have committed a crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term sanctuary city refers to localities that choose to have limited or no cooperation with the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If adopted in the final state budget, the Department of Criminal Justice Services director will be required to withhold from sanctuary city localities state funding that is usually earmarked for local police departments. The Compensation Board will also be required to withhold state per diem payments to local and regional jails. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal would also require local law enforcement and jail officials to provide notification to ICE 48 hours ahead of the release of  immigrants lacking permanent legal status who have committed a crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s administration noted a recent </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/virginia-crime-herndon-virginia-man-arrest-repeat-offender-sexual-assault-rape-case-denis-humberto-navarette-romero-united-states-immigration-deportation-ice-illegal-immigrant-migrant-washington-old-dominion-railroad-trail-investigation" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of an immigrant man in the U.S. illegallywith a previous criminal history who allegedly raped a woman on a running trail in Herndon, court documents show. Youngkin’s announcement also pointed out an instance this summer in Fairfax County where an undocumented person suspected of sex crimes against minors was </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/fairfax-county-virginia-immigration-detainers-ice-services-migrants-undocumented-child-sex-crimes-tim-kaine-hung-cao-deportation?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">not detained</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A handful of cities and counties in Virginia have adopted policies to stop f law enforcement and municipal staff from voluntarily inquiring about a person’s immigration status, including  Arlington, Alexandria, Fairfax County and the city of Richmond. While most of the policies do entail compliance with ICE as federally mandated, they outline how municipal staff don’t need to make extra efforts to identify people who are potentially here illegally. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Arlington’s 2022 Trust Policy states that the city “will comply with all applicable federal or state regulations mandating cooperation with ICE and other federal immigration</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">officials &#8230; but will otherwise restrict sharing of personally identifiable information that could be used to further immigration enforcement efforts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2017 </span><a href="https://www.wtvr.com/2017/02/06/stoney-policies-of-inclusion" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Richmond mayor Levar Stoney, however, entails noncompliance with ICE. Richmond City Jail and a few others around Virginia were listed as “non-compliant institutions” in an ICE report from June 2024. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of late November, according to the DCJS, nearly 1,000 incarcerated people in Virginia have had open immigration detainer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for Youngkin’s proposal to take effect, it will need to be approved by the state legislature during 2025’s state budget negotiations. </span></p>

(Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republicans in Virginia’s 10th state Senate District will convene for a mass meeting on Friday to select their nominee in an upcoming special election. The vacancy was prompted by the resignation of Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland, who is set to leave his post after being elected to Congress​. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meeting will take place at the Goochland Rec Center, with registration running from 4:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., and proceedings beginning at 6:30 p.m. A total of seven candidates are vying to succeed McGuire. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organized by local party committees, mass meetings require party members to gather at a designated time and place to publicly select a candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike secret ballots, voting is often conducted through a show of hands, voice vote, or other public method. Participants must remain present for multiple rounds of voting until one candidate secures a majority — typically more than 50% of the votes — to be declared the winner. This process can be lengthy, especially in races with a crowded field of candidates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the GOP nominee is selected, they will face Democrat Jack Trammel in a special election on Jan. 7 set by Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, the Senate president pro tempore. The winner will serve out the remainder of McGuire’s term in the Senate, which ends in 2027.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the first Republicans to declare their candidacy for McGuire’s seat was Amanda Chase, a former state senator from Chesterfield County who served in the Virginia Senate for eight years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chase previously ran for re-election in 2023 but lost the GOP primary for her Chesterfield-based seat to Sen. Glen Sturtevant. To qualify for the 10th District race, Chase moved to Appomattox County, as Virginia law requires state legislators to live in the district they represent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joining the race is Shayne Snavely, an Amelia-based entrepreneur, veteran who was a former aide to Chase and worked on her failed 2021 gubernatorial campaign. Jean Gannon, a Powhatan County real estate appraiser and long-time Republican activist, has also thrown her hat into the ring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duane Adams, the chairman of the Louisa County Board of Supervisors, is making a bid for the seat as well. Adams previously ran for the Republican nomination in the district in 2023 but was defeated by McGuire​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other contenders include Alex Cheatham, a recent college graduate aiming to make his political debut, and two late entrants: Luther Cifers, a businessman from Prince Edward County, and Bryan Hamlet, chairman of the Cumberland County Board of Supervisors​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a pretty good selection among the group there. I don’t know everybody, but I think that they will all be competitive candidates in that district,” Rich Anderson, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a phone interview. “Obviously as a conservative Republican leading the conservative party, I want to get a conservative Republican nominated.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anderson said that the mass meeting could last late into the evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The process will probably require multiple ballots with that many people on the docket, so we’ll just see how it all turns out. I can’t predict who will walk away with all the marbles, but one of them will.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said that of the Republicans who have thrown their names in the ring for the special election to replace McGuire, “Chase is perhaps the best known or most notorious.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Richards doubts that Chase will get her party’s nod. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The mass meeting nomination process caters to party members, and Chase has little credibility with the local party after being expelled by the Chesterfield GOP and being noticeably absent from the one candidates forum already held. And she has little credibility with local Republicans, which will hurt her chances.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the remaining six candidates, Adams has been very active beginning with his unsuccessful bid for the nomination in 2023, which McGuire won, Richards said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The key to these mass meetings is name recognition in a positive way. Aside from the candidate forum held in late November, there has not been much opportunity or time for candidates to get their message out. Their pre-existing connections will tip the scale, which is why I expect Adams to win the nomination.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adams will still “get a run for his money” from Snavely, who also has a lot of party experience working for Chase earlier in his career, Richards added. “The other candidates have very low profiles, but Jean Gannon has been active in local GOP politics, which might help her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGuire, who in June defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Bob Good, R-Farmville, in one of the most viciously fought and expensive GOP primary battles nationwide this year, had kept Republicans </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/mcguire-still-hasnt-resigned-his-state-senate-seat-weeks-after-congressional-win/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">on edge for weeks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after winning his election against Democrat Gloria Witt on Nov. 5. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, elected officials who win a new position resign from their current office within days to allow for a special election to be called promptly, ensuring the seat isn’t left vacant when the next legislative session begins in early January. However, McGuire delayed his departure, formally stepping down on Wednesday​.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his official resignation letter, McGuire called his brief stint in the state Senate “the privilege of a lifetime” and said he hoped voters would choose “a strong candidate who loves We The People,” works well with others and who has “never wavered on our core Republican values.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, McGuire stopped short from publicly backing one of the seven candidates vying to succeed him. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was not too surprised that McGuire has not endorsed anyone, especially Adams,” said Richards. “When McGuire announced he was primarying Bob Good, Adams was very vocal about McGuire’s decision, calling him a liar, so there does not seem to be much love lost there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 10th Senate District, which spans 11 localities from Lynchburg in the west to the suburbs of Richmond in the east, leans heavily Republican. The district backed President-elect Donald Trump with 62.8% of the vote last month and gave Republican Glenn Youngkin an even stronger 67.8% support during his successful 2021 gubernatorial campaign.</span></p>

Solar power growth is expected to help some parts of the country meet electric demand this summer. (Robert Zullo/ States Newsroom)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New rules for building solar energy projects on prime Virginia farmland and forested areas are part of the ongoing  solar siting discussion in the state and are drawing ire from solar developers but support from the farmers and the forestry industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules, known as House Bill 206 regulations, stem from </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?221+sum+HB206#:~:text=The%20bill%20specifies%20that%20a,adverse%20impact%20on%20natural%20resources." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">legislation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> passed in the 2022 session that established the legal determination that solar projects generating up to 150 megawatts would have an adverse impact and require mitigation if they were built on more than 10 acres of prime farmland, and 50 acres of contiguous forested land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime farmland is critical to the agricultural industry in Virginia because of its rich soils that help crop growth. Forests provide wildlife habitat, capture carbon from the air and soak up floodwaters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the Virginia Clean Economy Act, a 2020 law seeking to decarbonize the grid, mandates that Dominion Energy build about 16,100 megawatts of solar power and Appalachian Power Company build 600 megawatts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the general rule of thumb being that one megawatt of solar needs about seven acres, the potential development of solar has rural communities fuming over projects taking away their cherished landscapes and contributions to the agricultural and forestry industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This bill was meant to try and strike that balance,”  Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, said during a panel discussion at the Virginia Clean Energy Summit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past five years, about 2,400, or 3%, of the 97,000 acres of prime farmland lost annually has been taken up by solar, with other types of development making up the difference in losses, according to the Department of Environmental Quality. About 7,730 acres of forest has been lost over that period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposed rules are the culmination of two stakeholder groups’ </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/12/20/state-work-group-on-solar-development-unable-to-reach-consensus/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">discussions </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">over the past two years. DEQ is reviewing the comments and is expected to finalize them early next year.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">What the rules call for</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rules largely follow a 1:1 mitigation ratio for the two types of land, meaning that for every acre that is disturbed on-site, developers must take mitigation steps to conserve that amount on- site or off-site, including paying for easements that prevent development to protect the same type of land in nearby areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amount of mitigation needed can change depending on certain steps taken during development. One example would be a developer not changing the grade or slope of the land, which can alter how much erosion occurs from water running off of the panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitigation requirements can also be reduced by limiting soil compaction in order to help the land return to agricultural production at the end of a solar facilities’ typical 30-year lifecycle. Incorporating </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/18/dominion-energy-pairs-solar-with-honey-bees-to-preserve-agricultural-land/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agrivoltaics </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and preserving riparian forest buffers can also prevent erosion along waterways and soak up pollutants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Disturbance of C1 or C2 forest corridors, which are recognized as having enhanced wildlife and environmental benefits, do require increased mitigation measures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s very clear as to what has to be mitigated, but it says nothing about how to mitigate those impacts, so we looked at the different tools,” said Jonathan Rak, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief policy advisor at DEQ.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Conflicting comments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar developers see the rules as being costly, while agricultural community members support the requirements to preserve land for Virginia&#8217;s top economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulations “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overlook solar&#8217;s substantial economic contributions, including thousands of jobs, millions in tax revenues, land-lease payments, and significant capital investment in Virginia,” wrote Marshall Conrad, with the North Carolina-based solar developer Strata Clean Energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental groups, including the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, submitted comments voicing similar concerns, saying the easement costs “could easily exceed $2 million at larger facilities,” and could push developers to a lengthier approval process at the State Corporation Commission. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But other environmental groups, like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Virginia Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts, supported or wanted to strengthen the rules because of the potential harm solar development poses to Chesapeake Bay cleanup goals, which includes planting trees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Utility scale solar projects are therefore impairing Virginia’s ability to meet its environmental obligations to the Chesapeake Bay region,” Scott Cameron, second vice president of the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District, wrote in comments sent to the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the agricultural front, the Virginia Cattlemen&#8217;s Association pointed to the concern that about 500,000 acres of all types of Virginia farmland have been lost over the past five years as reason to support the rules to keep farmland in production. And the Virginia Forestry Products Association voiced similar worries over the loss of trees, but noted a potential unintended consequence of 500 acres of forestland being lost to solar development, and another 500 acres of land going under an easement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The potential net effect of this type of mitigation is instead of sawmills losing 500 acres for future harvest, we have lost 1,000 acres if truly commercial timber harvesting is in any way discouraged under these easements,” wrote the Virginia Forestry Products Association.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Disturbed lands</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid using farmland or forested areas, many have suggested developing solar projects on previously mined land that’s already been disturbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Virginia Energy, there are 125,000 acres of that land available, though some if it is remote with limited distribution lines, has rocky terrain that could be challenging to build on and could be used for economic development projects aimed at revitalizing the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think there&#8217;s a balance there of looking at what locations are better suited for some types of development,” said Daniel Kestner, economic development program manager at Virginia Energy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voters in House District 26 and Senate District 32, many of whom had just cast ballots in last month’s presidential and congressional elections, are now being called back to the polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Voters who support reproductive rights, you cannot sit this one out,” Repro Rising Virginia Director Tarina Keene told attendees at a gathering in Ashburn Wednesday morning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic control of Virginia’s House and Senate is seen as critical to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/06/national-democratic-group-boosts-srinivassan-singh-in-upcoming-virginia-special-elections/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advancing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a proposed constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights. Securing both chambers would give </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats, who currently hold a slim 21-19 edge in the Senate and a 51-48 majority in the House, a stronger position to push forward the amendment in a state where Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin maintains veto power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While abortion is not strictly a partisan issue, it often divides lawmakers along partisan lines. During last year’s statewide General Assembly elections, many Republicans supported Youngkin’s proposal to restrict most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. In contrast, Democrats campaigned on preserving the state’s existing abortion laws, with a long-term goal of enshrining abortion protections in the state Constitution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Sen. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun, was elected to Congress in November, Del. Kannan Srinivasan, D-Loudoun, secured the Democratic nomination to succeed him in the Virginia Senate. To fill Srinivasan’s seat in the House of Delegates, first-time candidate J.J. Singh earned the Democratic nomination, positioning himself as a fresh face in the party’s push to maintain its legislative majority. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents of the 26th House District can cast their votes between now and Jan. 7, choosing between Singh and Republican challenger Ram Venkatachalam. Meanwhile, voters in Senate District 32 will decide  between Srinivasan and Republican Tumay Harding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venkatachalam and Harding did not respond to requests for comment on their positions regarding abortion access as of publication, and Venkatachalam’s campaign </span><a href="https://ramforva.com/why-im-running/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> does not reference  reproductive health or abortion, leaving his stance on this issue unclear. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harding’s campaign </span><a href="https://tumayforva.com/issues/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states that she believes life “begins at conception.” She also emphasizes the need for measures to support expecting parents and “reduce abortions.” Additionally, Harding acknowledges that most abortions later in pregnancy are already prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, abortions are allowed for any reason through the second trimester, which lasts until about 26 weeks of pregnancy. In the third trimester, abortions are only permitted with the approval of three doctors. A proposed constitutional amendment would ease that requirement, allowing a single doctor to authorize a third-trimester abortion if it is deemed necessary to protect the pregnant person’s life or mental health, or if the fetus is deemed non-viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no universal definition of fetal viability — the point at which a fetus can survive outside of the womb — doctors typically assess it on a case-by-case basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Less than 1% of abortions occur after 21 weeks of pregnancy, according to the most recent </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductive-health/data-statistics/abortion-surveillance-findings-reports.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some abortions that occur within the second or third trimester have been the result of </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/two-women-two-pregnancies-two-agonizing-decisions/article_24e5d5fc-742d-11ee-984d-6befc702d5d0.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">severe fetal anomalies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, low</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/fatal-anomaly-exception-didnt-spare-alabama-mom-who-needed-an-abortion/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fetal viability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, or stem from </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/24/these-u-s-supreme-court-cases-could-affect-abortion-access-nationwide/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medical emergencies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the only Southern state without strict abortion restrictions or a ban, Virginia has also become an important access point for people seeking abortions from neighboring states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I cannot imagine what women are going through in those states, dealing with situations where politicians should not be interfering (and) should not be involved,” Srinivasan said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He and Singh also shared personal connections to reproductive healthcare laws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Srinivasan shared a story about his wife, who was once told that her life would be at risk if she became pregnant. Singh, too, emphasized the importance of reproductive rights, especially for his young daughters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have two young daughters and I care about their access to reproductive health,” Singh said. “I don’t want politicians in the doctor’s offices with them as they make decisions about their own bodies.”</span></p>

As a pediatric rheumatologist, I’ve witnessed families making hard choices when their prescriptions become too expensive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I find it incredibly upsetting when some Virginia hospitals and healthcare systems exploit and profit from federal programs intended to provide underserved patients with financial relief while serving as a safety net for those struggling to afford medications. Increased transparency and oversight are required to ensure that these programs directly benefit patients – not increase the profits of hospitals and other health care corporations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 340B Drug Pricing Program, or 340B, was created by Congress in 1992 to help low-income and uninsured patients living with conditions requiring costly outpatient medications access these necessary treatments and is a prime example of an essential safety net program. Through 340B, qualifying hospitals and clinics serving a large number of vulnerable patients can purchase deeply discounted medicines directly from pharmaceutical manufacturers with the expectation that they use these savings to help patients to afford and access their necessary medications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few years, many large hospitals and other corporations have turned the well-intentioned program into a profit-making scheme to improve their own bottom lines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At 340B hospitals, the average cost per prescription is more than </span><a href="https://phrma.org/Blog/New-year-same-exploitation-of-the-340B-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">150%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> higher for patients than at non-340B hospitals. Meanwhile, </span><a href="https://340breform.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Charity-Care-Report-Final-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly 70%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 340B hospitals that care for many vulnerable patients are providing below-average levels of lower-cost or free care. What was once a little-known program intended to help our community’s most vulnerable has now ballooned into the </span><a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/subcommittee-chair-griffith-opening-remarks-at-oversight-hearing-on-the-340-b-program" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">second largest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> federal prescription drug program nationwide, with more and more hospitals profiting from 340B discounts. It has become a critical income source for hospitals — rather than an essential source of medications for eligible patients.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These hospitals, which make up </span><a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/updates/2023-340b-covered-entity-purchases?" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">78% of the entire program’s spending</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, purchase and significantly profit from discounted 340B medications. Large hospital systems are increasingly acquiring pharmacies, practices and smaller health centers, such as oncology and infusion clinics, to further capitalize on 340B discounts without lowering patients’ costs or providing higher quality care. In fact, between 2016 and 2022, larger 340B hospitals were responsible for </span><a href="https://avalere.com/insights/characteristics-of-hospitals-undergoing-mergers-and-acquisitions" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about 80%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of hospital acquisitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These troubling incentives for hospital acquisitions and cost-shifting are leading to small clinic closures and less health care options for patients across the country — even in our own backyard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As reported by </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/24/health/bon-secours-mercy-health-profit-poor-neighborhood.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2022, Bon Secours Mercy Health, a prominent nonprofit health system, acquired Richmond Community Hospital, a cash-strapped community hospital, in 1995. In the following decades, Bon Secours abused its ownership of Richmond Community Hospital and took advantage of 340B discounted purchases while cutting services at Richmond Community Hospital, according to The New York Times. Medications purchased using the 340B program were given to commercially insured patients throughout the region while billing the commercial rates, thereby pocketing the price differences. Meanwhile, Bon Secours has one of the highest profit margins of any hospital in Virginia, generating as much as </span><a href="https://www.vhi.org/Bon%2520Secours%2520Richmond%2520Community%2520Hospital.html?tab=&amp;?=h9880/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program, originally intended to serve the most vulnerable patients, is now growing due to rampant abuse from hospital systems and for-profit corporations. In 2023 alone, 340B covered entities used the program to purchase over </span><a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/opa/updates/2023-340b-covered-entity-purchases" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$66 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in outpatient drugs — an over 23% increase from the year before. Much of this growth is due, in part, to 340B hospitals’ ability to also contract with an unlimited number of pharmacies — including those out-of-state — many of which are owned by the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and insurers. As a result, PBMs and 340B contract pharmacies share in the massive profits from discounted 340B medicines. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.drugchannels.net/2023/07/exclusive-for-2023-five-for-profit.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than half</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the entire U.S. pharmacy industry is contracted to dispense steeply discounted 340B drugs. But hospitals are not required to share these discounted prices with patients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The numbers are clear — 340B has become less about helping vulnerable patients and their families access the care they need and more about hospital systems and other corporations capitalizing on these federally mandated discounts to improve bottom lines, or </span><a href="https://www.adapadvocacy.org/pdf-docs/2024_ADAP_RW_340B_Project_Asset_6_ExecComp_FInal_Report_06-05-24.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">even boost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> executive compensation at hospitals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While 340B is an important safety net in Virginia, it is in dire need of federal action to improve transparency and accountability measures to ensure it works as intended. Any proposed 340B policy that allows hospitals and other corporations to continue their rampant abuse must be reconsidered. Without action from Congress, hospitals, and corporations will continue to profit, while Virginia’s financially vulnerable patients and families are left without a functioning safety net to catch them. </span></p>

<p>More than 3 million adults in nine states would be at immediate risk of losing their health coverage should the GOP reduce the extra federal Medicaid funding that’s enabled states to widen eligibility, <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-expansion-is-a-red-and-blue-state-issue/" target="_blank">according to KFF</a>, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, and the Georgetown University <a href="https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2024/11/27/federal-funding-cuts-to-medicaid-may-trigger-automatic-loss-of-health-coverage-for-millions-of-residents-of-certain-states/" target="_blank">Center for Children and Families</a>. That’s because the states have trigger laws that would swiftly end their Medicaid expansions if federal funding falls.</p>
<p>The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah, and Virginia.</p>
<div class="datawrapper-embed block--datawrapper-embed "><iframe id="datawrapper-chart-NzypI" title="Which States Have Medicaid-Expansion Trigger Laws?" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NzypI" height="578" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" aria-label="Interactive DataWrapper Embed" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></div>
<p>The 2010 Affordable Care Act encouraged states to expand Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans who didn’t get health insurance through their jobs. Forty states and the District of Columbia agreed, extending health insurance since 2014 to an estimated 21 million people and helping drive the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.</p>
<p>In exchange, the federal government pays 90% of the cost to cover the expanded population. That’s far higher than the federal match for other Medicaid beneficiaries, which averages about 57% nationwide.</p>
<p>Conservative policy groups, which generally have opposed the ACA, say the program costs too much and covers too many people. Democrats say the Medicaid expansion has saved lives and helped communities by widening coverage to people who could not afford private insurance.</p>
<p>If Congress cuts federal funding, Medicaid expansion would be at risk in all states that have opted into it — even those without trigger laws — because state legislatures would be forced to make up the difference, said Renuka Tipirneni, an associate professor at the University of Michigan’s School of Public Health.</p>
<p>Decisions to keep or roll back the expansion “would depend on the politics at the state level,” Tipirneni said.</p>
<p>For instance, Michigan approved a trigger as part of its Medicaid expansion in 2013, when it was controlled by a Republican governor and legislature. Last year, with the government controlled by Democrats, the state eliminated its funding trigger.</p>
<p>Six of the nine states with trigger laws — Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina, and Utah — went for Trump in the 2024 election.</p>
	<div class="newsroomSidebarContainer ">
	<div class="newsroomSidebar">
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia became the 33rd state to expand Medicaid in the summer of 2018, which allowed more people to be eligible. Following months of legislative debate that year, it passed with bipartisan support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicaid is a state and federal program that provides insurance coverage to low-income people or people with disabilities. Prior to the expansion taking effect in 2019, childless adults were not eligible in Virginia and parents were only eligible for up to 38% of the federal poverty level. According to a 2022 National Library of Medicine </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9134455/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Virginia had one of the highest uninsured rates of non-elderly adults below 138% of the federal poverty level. The study also found that people were less likely to delay medical care since the expansions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s the benefits to Virginians that Sen. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax, said she is focused on amid possible changes in the federal landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that the Senate’s finance committee discussed the matter at a recent retreat and she hopes lawmakers with higher concentrations of people who have benefitted from Medicaid in their districts will think about protecting the expansion. Boysko finds it “disturbing” that Medicaid funding could be on the federal “chopping block” and is concerned what a federal GOP trifecta might mean for the Affordable Care Act overall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Boysko noted that Virginia’s state health insurance exchange — also made possible by the ACA—  could be a way to “absorb” some patients if need be and said that lawmakers may also need to “get creative” with some of its surplus. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Virginia and the nation are also experiencing a Medicaid “unwinding,” as eligibility checks are underway to determine who still meets criteria to remain covered and who does not. In recent months, over 500,000 people have been </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/nearly-500000-virginians-in-medicaid-have-been-disenrolled/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">disenrolled </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">while about 2 million have been </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/va-dept-of-medical-services-to-tap-reserve-fund-to-cover-delayed-payments-amid-medicaid-unwinding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">redetermined</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to data from the Department of Medical Assistance Services.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We will address whatever we have to in the General Assembly to do the best we can to help protect our residents,” Boysko said. “But we&#8217;ve still got to see how this all pans out.” —Charlotte Rene Woods, Virginia Mercury reporter</span></div>
	</div>
	
<p>Most of the nine states’ triggers kick in if federal funding falls below the 90% threshold. Arizona’s trigger would eliminate its expansion if funding falls below 80%.</p>
<p>Montana’s law rolls back expansion below 90% funding but allows it to continue if lawmakers identify additional funding. Under state law, Montana lawmakers <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/montana-medicaid-expansion-renewal-2025/" target="_blank">must reauthorize its Medicaid expansion</a> in 2025 or the expansion will end.</p>
<p>Across the states with triggers, between 3.1 million and 3.7 million people would swiftly lose their coverage, researchers at KFF and the Georgetown center estimate. The difference depends on how states treat people who were added to Medicaid before the ACA expansion; they may continue to qualify even if the expansion ends.</p>
<p>Three other states — Iowa, Idaho, and New Mexico— have laws that require their governments to mitigate the financial impact of losing federal Medicaid expansion funding but would not automatically end expansions. With those three states included, about 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees would be at risk of losing coverage, according to KFF.</p>
<p>The ACA allowed Medicaid expansions to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $20,783 for an individual in 2024.</p>
<p>Nearly a quarter of the 81 million people enrolled in Medicaid nationally are in the program due to expansions.</p>
<p>“With a reduction in the expansion match rate, it is likely that all states would need to evaluate whether to continue expansion coverage because it would require a significant increase in state spending,” said Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF. “If states drop coverage, it is likely that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured, and that would limit access to care across red and blue states that have adopted expansion.”</p>
<p>States rarely cut eligibility for social programs such as Medicaid once it’s been granted.</p>
<p>The triggers make it politically easier for state lawmakers to end Medicaid expansion because they would not have to take any new action to cut coverage, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.</p>
<p>To see the impact of trigger laws, consider what happened after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and, with it, the constitutional right to an abortion. Conservative lawmakers in 13 states had crafted trigger laws that would automatically implement bans in the event a national right to abortion were struck down. Those state laws resulted in restrictions taking effect immediately after the court ruling, or shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>States adopted triggers as part of Medicaid expansion to win over lawmakers skeptical of putting state dollars on the hook for a federal program unpopular with most Republicans.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what Trump and congressional Republicans will do with Medicaid after he takes office in January, but one indicator could be a recent recommendation from the Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative policy organization led by former Trump health adviser Brian Blase.</p>
<p>Paragon has proposed that starting in 2026 the federal government would phase down the 90% federal match for expansion until 2034, when it would reach parity with each state’s federal match for its traditional enrollees. Under that plan, states could still get ACA Medicaid expansion funding but restrict coverage to enrollees with incomes up to the federal poverty level. Currently, to receive expansion funding, states must offer coverage to everyone up to 138% of the poverty level.</p>
<p>Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona, said it’s unlikely Arizona would move to eliminate its trigger and make up for lost federal funds. “It would be a tough sell right now as it would put a big strain on the budget,” he said.</p>
<p>Medicaid has been in the crosshairs of Republicans in Washington before. Republican congressional leaders in 2017 proposed legislation to cut federal expansion funding, a move that would have shifted billions in costs to states. That plan, part of a strategy to repeal Obamacare, ultimately failed.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Trump has promised his base his administration will enact mass deportations of people living in the country illegally. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said at a Judiciary hearing that Senate Republicans will focus on increasing beds at detention centers, hiring Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and purchasing technology for enforcement at the southern border.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is our belief that the only way you’ll get control of the border is for deportations to start early,” he said. “If we do not have outflow, the inflow will continue.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, a senior fellow at the pro-immigration think tank the American Immigration Council, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, told the panel the endeavor will be expensive.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carrying out mass deportations of 1 million people would <a href="https://immigrationimpact.com/2024/10/02/report-costs-mass-deportation-immigration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost about $88 billion a year</a> for arrests, detainment and removal, he said. About 13 million people are living in the United States illegally.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Fixing a broken system</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The committee hearing, led by Democrats who control the Senate now but will be in the minority next year, explored the ramifications of the Trump campaign promise of mass deportations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Instead of mass deportations, mass accountability,” said the chair of the committee, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois. “Let’s fix our broken immigration system in a way that protects our country and honors our heritage as a nation of immigrants.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The budget reconciliation process cited by Graham that would be used to pass border security legislation, if successful, would allow Republicans to get around the 60-vote filibuster in the Senate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reconciliation is generally used when one party controls the House, Senate and the White House, because it only requires a majority vote in each chamber.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Graham added that Republicans will also prevent those people who were paroled into the country through executive authority from employing another avenue for legal immigration status. The GOP has been critical of programs that allow certain nationals from Haiti, Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela to temporarily work and live in the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“So if you’re here illegally, get ready to leave,” Graham said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">DACA program</h4>
<p dir="ltr">One of the hearing witnesses, Foday Turay, is in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which is awaiting a federal court ruling on its legality after the Trump administration tried to end it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Separately, on Monday, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/12/09/texas-daca-recipients-affordable-care-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a federal court blocked</a> the implementation of a final rule from the Biden administration to allow DACA recipients to have health care access under the Affordable Care Act. </p>
<p dir="ltr">About 500,000 people are in the program, which is aimed at protecting children brought into the country without authorization from deportation. It also allows them to obtain work permits.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Turay is an assistant district attorney in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office, and said if he were deported it would devastate his family, as he is the primary income earner in his household.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He said his wife, a U.S. citizen, is the primary caretaker of her mother, a person with disabilities who is undergoing cancer treatments. Additionally, Turay said he would have to leave his son behind if he is deported.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another witness, Patty Morin of Aberdeen, Maryland, told how her daughter, Rachel, was killed. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/1-year-ago-maryland-mom-rachel-morin-was-murdered-heres-what-happened-since-baltimore-ma-and-pa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The suspect, who was charged</a> with first-degree murder and sexual assault, was in the country illegally and had a prior criminal record.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Durbin said Democrats are not opposed to ICE carrying out its duties to deport those with criminal records and stressed that Trump’s plans for mass deportations extend beyond that group and would include people like Turay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This man for a living is prosecuting criminals,” Durbin said of Turay. “This other individual is a clear criminal with a record. When we say ‘mass deportation,’ should we consider them the same because they’re both undocumented?”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Graham said when it comes to DACA, “hopefully we can find a solution to that problem.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the weekend, Trump expressed his support for coming to an agreement with Democrats to allow DACA recipients to remain in the country, despite trying to end the program during his first term.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Use of National Guard</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Durbin said he is concerned about Trump’s comments about using the National Guard to carry out mass deportations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the witnesses, Randy Manner, a retired major general in the U.S. Army, said he sees problems with using the military for mass deportations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It could affect military readiness, he said, and the military is not trained in that capacity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Immigration enforcement is the responsibility of federal law enforcement agencies,” Manner said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He added that having soldiers carry out that directive would have a negative impact on morale and recruiting. Manner also said having the U.S. military involved in that kind of political messaging would erode public trust.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Cost of mass deportations</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said not only would mass deportations be harmful to communities, but a financial strain as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reichlin-Melnick said industries that would be hit particularly hard by losing employees would include construction, agriculture and hospitality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Reichlin-Melnick also argued that ICE already focuses on arresting and conducting deportation proceedings for noncitizens with criminal records.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The overwhelming majority of people who would be the target of a mass deportation campaign do not have criminal records,” he said. “They are people who have been living otherwise law-abiding lives in this country, living, working and, in many cases, paying taxes.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn suggested that local law enforcement should be empowered to carry out deportations, even though immigration enforcement is a federal issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Art Arthur, a resident fellow in law and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for sharply limiting immigration, supported that idea.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“They’re going to be the people who are best able to pull those individuals out of the community,” Arthur said of local law enforcement.</p>

Wes Moore leads Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and officials of Chesapeake Bay watershed jurisdictions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Chesapeake Bay Commission from the Maryland State House to the annual public meeting of the Chesapeake Executive Council on Dec. 10, 2024. (Will Parson/Chesapeake Bay Program)</p><p>Top officials from all the Chesapeake Bay states and the federal government gathered in Annapolis Tuesday to reiterate their commitment to cleaning up the historically and economically critical estuary and strengthening the decade-long partnership that has helped improved the Bay’s health — even if that progress hasn’t been as swift and consistent as they might have hoped.</p>
<p>Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D), seated next to Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R), with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) participating by video, convened the annual meeting of the Chesapeake Bay Executive Council, which consists of leaders of the six states in the Bay watershed, along with the District of Columbia, to retool their 10-year-old cooperative agreement at a critical juncture in the Bay cleanup.</p>
<p>The meeting comes just weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who unsuccessfully tried to eliminate funding for Bay programs during his first term, adding an element of uncertainty for the Chesapeake’s state-based environmental stewards. But officials from red and blue states described their allegiance to the Bay cleanup as durable and unshakable Tuesday.</p>
<p>Moore called the Bay “the greatest heirloom clearly we have,” saying, “We did not create it. We inherited it. So it’s up to us to protect it.”</p>
<p>He also outlined legislation that he plans to introduce during the 2025 General Assembly session to strengthen Bay health, which he is tentatively calling the Bay Legacy Act.</p>
<p>The original multistate partnership, fashioned by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2014 during the Obama administration, laid out 31 goals for the Bay states and D.C. to meet by 2025. While some states have fallen short of hitting some of the marks, federal and state officials describe the program — and particularly the sense of partnership it has engendered — as an overwhelming success.</p>

<p>“The goals don’t need to be changed,” Youngkin said. “We just need more time to achieve them.”</p>
<p>The state and federal leaders did vote Tuesday to <a href="https://d18lev1ok5leia.cloudfront.net/chesapeakebay/documents/FINAL-Beyond-2025-Steering-Committee-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revise the watershed agreement</a>, taking several recommendations from a steering committee of numerous stakeholders that has been meeting for more than two years. Some of the proposed changes seek to streamline the way data is collected and analyzed, and also try to heighten accountability in Bay cleanup efforts.</p>
<p>One proposal would place more emphasis on habitat rehabilitation throughout the Bay watershed, while another would spotlight climate impacts in the government’s ongoing scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>The Chesapeake Bay Program is also going to create an Agricultural Advisory Committee, to elevate the priorities of a sector that’s critical to Bay health — and a huge economic driver in the region — before the executive council.</p>
<p>“This allows farmers to make improvements while preserving the viability of their businesses,” Youngkin said.</p>
<p>The agriculture committee will complement the work of the <a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/who/group/lgac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Government Advisory Committee</a>, <a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/who/group/stac" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee</a> and <a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/who/group/citizens-advisory-committee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stakeholders Advisory Committee</a>.</p>
<p>Every speaker during the public meeting Tuesday — including environmental agency officials from D.C., Delaware, West Virginia and New York, and two high-ranking EPA officials — emphasized the importance of the ongoing partnership between the states and the federal government.</p>
<p>“The Chesapeake Bay has always been our region’s greatest unifier, and we just saw that bipartisan support for the Bay is alive and well,” said Hilary Harp Falk, president and CEO of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. “It’s a really big deal when three governors and leaders from around the region meet to stack hands and reaffirm commitments to clean water. This kind of local and state leadership is more critical than ever.”</p>
<p>Such cooperation hasn’t always been the case. In 2020, Maryland, Virginia and D.C. <a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2020/09/10/maryland-virginia-d-c-sue-epa-over-failure-to-enforce-chesapeake-bay-cleanup-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a federal lawsuit</a>against the Trump administration’s EPA, accusing the agency of violating the Clean Water Act by failing to enforce Chesapeake Bay pollution reduction limits for Pennsylvania and New York.</p>
<p>During his speech Tuesday — he was supposed to attend the meeting in person, but was sidelined by the heavy fog that blanketed the Mid-Atlantic — Shapiro acknowledged that his state had been lagging on its commitment to Bay cleanup goals until recent years.</p>
<figure id="attachment_85317" class="wp-caption alignright"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"> </figcaption></figure>
<p>“It is important for me to participate in this conversation, because for a long time, Pennsylvania was on the sidelines and now we’re in the game,” he said.</p>
<p>And in another sign of interstate collegiality, Youngkin nominated Moore to serve another year as chair of the executive council.</p>
<p>Asked after the meeting about the potential impact of the incoming Trump administration on Bay cleanup efforts, Moore reiterated the states’ commitment to working together.</p>
<p>“We all collectively understand the importance of this work,” he said, adding, “We look forward to working with the new administration to ensure that our goals are met.”</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Moore’s Bay Legacy Act</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Moore, from the dais of Tuesday’s meeting, offered broad details of the legislation he’s planning to introduce in the upcoming legislative session on Bay health. Those plans were fleshed out slightly by administration officials in interviews Tuesday. They said the bill, tentatively called the Bay Legacy Act, would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seek to increase regenerative farming practices in the state, particularly on land owned by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR), in part by offering long-term leases to farmers to encourage them to regenerate the soil;</li>
<li>Improve aquaculture permitting in the state; and</li>
<li>Strengthen water-quality monitoring programs within DNR, largely by establishing new protocols that would make it easier for the agency to work with other entities and “citizen scientists” who conduct water quality tests of their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Administration officials said more details on the proposed legislation could be released in a matter of days.</p>
<p>“We are going to continue to move forward and move fast in this state,” Moore said, “because that is what the people of Maryland demand and require.”</p>

				<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the meeting, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin reiterated his </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/09/virginia-regional-governors-to-discuss-chesapeake-bay-cleanup-goals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">executive directive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that expressed a desire to “work with farmers, not against them,” by maintaining the voluntary adoption of pollution-reducing agricultural best management practices through a cost-share program, which added 574 new farmers last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We need to accomplish our water quality goals through these voluntary approaches that allow our farmers to make conservation improvements while maintaining the viability of their businesses,” Youngkin said on Tuesday, later adding that “partnership compounds effectiveness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the meeting, Virginia Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Travis Voyles acknowledged in a statement to the Mercury that technical assistance, which is the engineering component needed to get pollution reducing agricultural best management practices installed properly and counted toward cleanup goals, is important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Coupling technical assistance with fully funding the agricultural cost-share program is a critical component of providing farmers the tools needed to successfully implement best management practices,” Voyles said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The directive from Youngkin also called for re-evaluating how the state’s taxpayer dollars are used, “including stormwater,” Voyles noted. One form of funding for stormwater cleanup projects is the Stormwater Local Assistance Fund, or SLAF, which was created in 2013 and has awarded matching grants to local governments for 357 projects totalling $212 million after approvals made earlier this </span><a href="https://www.deq.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/22326/638415063756400000" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, the directive called for the creation of a Statewide Wetlands Technical Team, led by the Department of Wildlife Resource.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wetlands can soak up pollution before it enters waterways, but have been diminished  due to development and sea level rise from climate change. Given that the watershed hasn’t been able to keep up with preserving wetlands, Virginia director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission Adrienne Kotulasaid the wetlands team will “certainly help the experts creating on-the-ground projects better align efforts, and result in increased efficiencies in their work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling the loss of wetlands her top concern for reaching cleanup goals, Kotula pointed to the $8 million in funding the Department of Wildlife Resources recently received from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to enhance the Ragged Island Wildlife Management Area along the </span><a href="https://dwr.virginia.gov/media/press-release/dwr-receives-grant-to-enhance-and-restore-critical-marsh-habitat-at-ragged-island-wildlife-management-area/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0fQafdwSn9XzPd4wsL6aUH2kbehWdu1IeLwauR5EzPDlNpIH1jYqHNETs_aem_5IbrEuAHr-hNymAhhK-nCQ" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">James River</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as an example the wetlands team can focus on That project can be coordinated “together,” Kotula said, with the about </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/08/01/federal-government-awards-150-million-to-reduce-emissions-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$50 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the agency received as part of a larger appropriation from the Environmental Protection Agency to conserve wetlands. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The question of how Virginia will address wetlands loss at the policy level remains unanswered and is critical for the Commonwealth to address,” Kotula said, roughly four weeks before the General Assembly session starts Jan. 8. — Charlie Paullin, Virginia Mercury reporter</span>			</div>

Glenn Youngkin's proposal to invest another $290 million for school construction needs during the upcoming legislative session which begins in January. (Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Tuesday announced that he is asking the legislature for an additional $290 million to support school construction and modernization efforts across Virginia. This latest investment would bring the total funding for the current biennium to $700 million and raise the state’s overall contribution under Youngkin’s administration to nearly $2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s funding request is included in his proposed budget amendments, which he plans to present next week at a joint meeting of the General Assembly’s money committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the governor’s office, the state’s financial commitments have spurred an estimated $3.4 billion in total funding for school construction. The additional support would be made possible through a combination of local government contributions and federal matching funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over the last three years, we have invested historic amounts in our education system, including our public school facilities,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Our record economic growth and the resulting surplus allows us to make this critical investment to ensure every Virginia student has access to high-quality school facilities that support academic success.” </span></p>

Glenn Youngkin speaking with reporters outside the Capitol Building on March 7, 2024. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin plans to use the newly announced $290 million in non-general funds to expand competitive grant opportunities for school divisions, particularly in high-need areas. The money would also address critical infrastructure issues, supporting the construction and renovation of schools in urgent need of repair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">State officials say the increased funding will provide K-12 students with safer, more conducive learning spaces, a move that has been welcomed by educators and community leaders alike. Local school divisions will be able to apply for grant support to fast-track modernization projects that may have been delayed due to funding shortfalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngkin administration has framed the initiative as part of a broader effort to support Virginia&#8217;s educational system and improve outcomes for students. As schools across the state face aging infrastructure and capacity challenges, this investment aims to reduce disparities in facility quality, especially in underserved areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of our guiding principles since day one of the Youngkin Administration has been to provide safe, vibrant, and healthy learning environments for all of our students,” said Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This investment in supporting new and refurbished school buildings makes it possible for every community in the commonwealth to have the means to provide a best-in-class education that prepares every student for success in our increasingly demanding knowledge- and skills-based economy.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, a member of the Commission on School Construction and Modernization, said that while she welcomed Youngkin’s proposal, she needed more information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been screaming from the rooftops about more money for school construction and ensuring that localities have what they need, so I’m glad to see that he&#8217;s trying to get on board,” Mundon King said. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41173" class="wp-caption alignright" style="max-width:100%;width:280px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/12/10/youngkin-seeks-additional-290-million-boost-for-school-construction/screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3-02-35-pm/" rel="attachment wp-att-41173"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-medium wp-image-41173" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-280x300.png" alt="" width="280" height="300" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-280x300.png 280w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-957x1024.png 957w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM-768x822.png 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-10-at-3.02.35 PM.png 1032w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. Candi Mundon King, D-Prince William, is a member of the Commission on School Construction and Modernization (Courtesy Candi Mundon King).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It is clear that we need to put more money into school construction, but I can’t say more without seeing a fully fleshed out plan. So I’m looking forward to his presentation next week with the joint money committees so we can fully evaluate what this proposal actually is, and not just some slick press release that doesn’t go into detail.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, Youngkin’s first year in office, the General Assembly in a bipartisan effort approved a historic $1.2 billion investment in school construction, aiming to modernize aging facilities and reduce funding disparities among school divisions. The sweeping plan combined grants and loans to support renovations, new construction, and capacity expansion for K-12 schools across the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the $1.2 billion, about $850 million was allocated for grants. This included $400 million in formula-based grants, which provided each of Virginia’s 134 school divisions with a $1 million base allocation. The remaining $266 million was distributed based on the Local Composite Index (LCI) — a state funding formula that considers factors like property values, taxable sales and population data to assess a locality’s financial ability to support its schools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another $450 million was funneled into the newly created School Construction Fund and Program, a competitive grant program designed to assist divisions with the most critical infrastructure needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">School systems with poor building conditions and limited financial capacity could apply for these funds to support construction, renovation, or expansion projects. This program is primarily funded by 98% of gaming revenue from Virginia’s four new casinos in Bristol, Danville, Portsmouth, and Norfolk. The fund is administered by the Virginia Board of Education.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia faces a mounting crisis with school infrastructure. Data released by the Virginia Department of Education in 2022 revealed that nearly 1,000 school buildings across the state are at least 50 years old. Replacing these facilities would cost more than $25 billion — a figure far beyond the capacity of most localities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Traditionally, local governments have shouldered the financial burden of school construction, relying on local tax revenue. But for economically distressed areas, particularly in Southwest Virginia and Southside, this has become an increasingly difficult challenge due to population decline and economic hardship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in April, Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/11/youngkin-vetoes-measure-to-let-va-localities-increase-sales-tax-to-pay-for-school-construction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vetoed a bill</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lawmakers sent to his desk that would have allowed localities to implement a 1% sales tax to help cover the costs of school construction and modernization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+sum+SB14" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> required voter approval through a referendum before the tax could be enacted by local governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin acknowledged that school construction is a “worthy cause” but argued that Virginia has already taken substantial steps to address those costs. He contended that citizens should not face additional taxes, particularly the $1.5 billion annually that would have been raised by the 1% sales tax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The commonwealth should pursue a tax policy that unleashes economic development and prioritizes job and wage growth through innovative reforms,” Youngkin said in his </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?241+amd+SB14AG" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">veto</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “These reforms must allow hardworking Virginians to keep more of their money, not less; any proposal that increases the cost of living and the cost of business is not a policy we should pursue.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to 2022, state assistance for school construction was limited, with much of it coming from the Literary Fund, a state-managed pool of money established in Virginia’s Constitution. Funded by sources such as unclaimed lottery winnings, criminal fines, and unclaimed property, the Literary Fund historically provided low-interest loans to support school construction and debt service for technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in recent years, much of the fund’s revenue was redirected to cover teacher retirement costs, leaving fewer resources for school building projects.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2022 legislative session retooled the Literary Fund’s loan program, significantly increasing its impact. Lawmakers raised the maximum loan amount from $7.5 million to $25 million and capped the interest rate at 2%. These changes made it more feasible for school divisions to finance major construction projects at a lower cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the state’s total contribution now approaching $2 billion, education advocates are hopeful the increased funding will lead to long-term improvements in school facilities and better learning conditions for students throughout the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Board of Education President Grace Creasey said Tuesday that the panel will prioritize “those school divisions in greatest need that have missed out on prior grant opportunities,” especially rural divisions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We also know that school divisions are eager to adopt seat time flexibility and competency-based models which requires us to design learning environments and spaces differently. This new investment will make this possible,” Creasey said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year since 2019, the federal government found that Virginia’s education department repeatedly failed to resolve complaints filed by parents of special education students, and it did not have “reasonably designed” procedures and practices to ensure a timely resolution process for those complaints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the state has taken the necessary steps to “address and resolve the findings of noncompliance and the required corrective actions” outlined in a March 13 monitoring report, according to a Dec. 5 letter from the U.S. Department of Education&#8217;s Office of Special Education Programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal agency indicated that no further action is needed after Virginia officials submitted documents highlighting corrective actions, including providing quicker feedback to school divisions and ensuring that all entities rather than LEAs, or school divisions, listed under the “</span><a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-B/chapter-III/part-300/subpart-A/subject-group-ECFR0ec59c730ac278e/section-300.33" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">public agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” definition are following the due process procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has nearly 181,000 students with disabilities. As federal law requires, Virginia must provide all students with disabilities a “free and appropriate public education” through personalized plans under the Individualized Education Program (IEP).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its letter, OSEP said that “having a consistent and transparent system for identifying and correcting noncompliance, particularly noncompliance that impacts the delivery of early intervention services, in accordance with individualized education programs (IEPs), and dispute resolution systems that protect the rights of parents, are essential elements to ensuring improved results for children and youth with disabilities,” and acknowledged Virginia’s “continued efforts” to better implement the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part B and to put in place “a reasonably designed general supervision system which ensures compliance and improving results for students with disabilities.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">VDOE’s corrective actions</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the compliance issues facing students, VDOE announced in October 2023 the formation of a workgroup to help develop the 2024 </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/programs-services/special-education#:~:text=2024%20Roadmap%20for%20Special%20Education&amp;text=This%20roadmap%20is%20expected%20to,postsecondary%20pathways%20for%20all%20learners." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roadmap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for Special Education and a team that reports directly to the superintendent of public instruction to monitor how school divisions provide special education services and assist them as needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around the same time period, VDOE also created a system to oversee the development and use of IEPs for students with special needs. Educators are required to undergo additional training on providing inclusive special education instruction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Board of Education also </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/03/29/virginia-adopts-regulatory-changes-for-special-education-amid-federal-review/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regulatory changes to how the state handles compliance complaints regarding students with disabilities and dedicated funds to examine the dispute resolution system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Since day one, Governor Youngkin has prioritized the success of students with disabilities and I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has recognized the hard work VDOE has done to improve our work for Virginia’s children with disabilities,&#8221; Superintendent of Public Instruction Lisa Coons said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Concerns, funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While she has not reviewed the documents the state’s education department submitted to federal authorities, special education advocate Kandise Lucas said she was concerned with the “accuracy” of those documents, specifically concerning the policies and procedures, and independent evaluations based on her recent interactions with schools, parents and students, one of whom she said has been out of school for three years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just have a real concern that … the Board of Education submitted those documents knowing that they&#8217;re not complying with the law, specifically as it pertains to independent evaluations, which was a major issue,” Lucas said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She questioned if VDOE is following the federal agency’s summary contained in the Dec. 5 letter, which requires the commonwealth to issue a memorandum or other directive to all local educational agencies (LEAs), parent advocacy groups, and other interested parties advising them of the proposed changes to state regulations and complaint procedures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucas said some hearing officers, who review parents&#8217; complaints, have yet to hear of the changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She also voiced concerns about the state refusing to enforce its regulations in school divisions about parents’ right to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">access educational records promptly under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act. Another worry is VDOE refusing to enforce hearing officer orders and state complaint determinations well beyond a year after the compliance requirement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carol Bauer, president of the Virginia Education Association, said in a statement that Gov. Glenn Youngkin’sadministration&#8217;s actions are “temporary solutions” that don’t solve the main issue — the underfunding of special education student needs in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bauer claimed that since the governor was elected, actual state spending on special education students has continued to “erode” and led to “unmanageable caseloads and subpar parent and family engagement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, evidence of underfunding schools was outlined in a study conducted by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission, the state’s legislative watchdog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JLARC found that the formula used to decide how much money schools need for teachers suggested fewer special education teachers than schools use or need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For fiscal year 2023, the funding formula calculated that 13,300 special education teachers were needed, which was 93% of the number employed by school divisions and 66% of what practitioners estimated was required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers’ work to overhaul the funding formula could take a while. Short-term </span><a href="https://studiesvirginiageneralassembly.s3.amazonaws.com/meeting_docs/documents/000/002/486/original/2._VDOE_Jt._Sub_Committee_Presentation_12.9.24_FINAL.pdf?1733765779" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommendations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> could be considered for the upcoming General Assembly session beginning in January.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/opinions/docs/2024/12/24-1113-2088317.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">order</a> from a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals preserves the bipartisan <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7521/text?s=1&#038;r=1&#038;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Protecting+Americans+from+Foreign+Adversary+Controlled+Applications+Act%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">law</a> President Joe Biden signed in April forcing ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, to cease operations in the United States over concerns the platform’s data gathering could be obtained and used by the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TikTok, ByteDance and a handful of users <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/tiktok-sues-block-new-us-law-banning-app-if-it-not-sold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued the administration to block</a> enforcement of the law, saying <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/congress-silenced-free-speech-tiktok-law-platform-tells-federal-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it violated the First Amendment</a> right to free speech and other rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The panel on Friday rejected that argument, saying that although the short-form videos produced on the service constitute speech and the shuttering of U.S. operations would limit that speech, that was the result of the Chinese government’s “hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security,” not the U.S. government’s actions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,” Senior Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg wrote for the panel. “Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary’s ability to gather data on people in the United States.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ginsburg, who was appointed to the court by Republican President Ronald Reagan, and Neomi Rao, a Donald Trump appointee, formed the court’s main opinion. Chief Judge Sri Srinavasan, whom Democrat Barack Obama appointed, wrote a concurring opinion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TikTok has the option to appeal Friday’s ruling to the full D.C. Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court. The law is set to go into effect Jan. 19, the day before Trump — who has said he opposes the law even after trying his own TikTok ban during his first presidency — retakes office.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Free speech concerns</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Those challenging the law are likely to appeal directly to the Supreme Court and to seek an emergency temporary stay, “given the urgency of the situation,” Jacob Huebert, who represents a plaintiff in the case, said in a Friday interview.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Huebert is the president of Liberty Justice Center, a nonprofit that has litigated high-profile free-speech cases and is representing the libertarian news and commentary channel BASEDPolitics in the TikTok case, arguing that the law unconstitutionally restricts the channel’s reach to its intended audience of Gen Z users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The government’s national security argument should not have overridden the First Amendment concerns, Huebert said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This national security justification that the court relied so heavily on isn’t enough,” he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The law would set a dangerous precedent that could be applied in the future to other social media, he added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It should trouble you regardless of what you think about TikTok or China in particular because it’s really a threat to Americans’ free speech rights online, across the board,” Huebert said.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Bill sponsors from both parties praise ruling</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The bipartisan leaders of the U.S. House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, where the bill was introduced, cheered the decision Friday in a joint statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Today’s ruling is a victory for the American people and TikTok users, and a loss for the Chinese Communist Party, which will no longer be able to exploit ByteDance’s control over TikTok to undermine our sovereignty, surveil our citizens, and threaten our national security,” Chairman John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican, wrote. “I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ranking Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois said there is no solution other than a sale of TikTok.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“With today’s opinion, all three branches of government have reached the same conclusion: ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, and TikTok’s ownership by ByteDance is a national security threat that cannot be mitigated through any other means than divestiture,” he said. “Every day that TikTok remains under the Chinese Communist Party’s control is a day that our security is at risk.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bill was introduced in March by then-Chair Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who has since left Congress, and Krishnamoorthi.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It has dozens of co-sponsors from each party and <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-votes-ban-tiktok-unless-it-sold-china-controlled-parent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> the House 352-65. The Senate <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/aid-ukraine-israel-overwhelmingly-approved-us-house-bipartisan-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cleared the bill in April</a> as part of a larger funding package.</p>

Although the labor market has cooled this year, the Trump administration stands to inherit a fairly healthy labor market, with decent job growth across many sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of jobs was bolstered by the return of striking workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report. Employment in transportation equipment manufacturing rose by 32,000 jobs. Boeing machinists who went on strike in September seeking higher pay and better retirement benefits reached a </span><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/boeing-factory-strike-ends-as-union-workers-vote-to-accept-contract#:~:text=Boeing%20factory%20strike%20ends%20as%20union%20workers%20vote%20to%20accept%20contract,-Nation%20Nov%205&amp;text=SEATTLE%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20Factory%20workers,and%20generate%20much%2Dneeded%20cash." target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agency also revised up the number of jobs added in the October and September reports by 56,000 jobs combined. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.1% to 4.2%, the economy is looking strong, particularly when you look at gross domestic product, said Louise Sheiner, with the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s been remarkably strong. If you look at what the Congressional Budget Office projected the level of real GDP before the pandemic, it&#8217;s higher now. We&#8217;ve just had a really strong economy,” said Sheiner, who focuses on fiscal policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although she said the labor market has been slowing a little, it’s still healthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elise Gould, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, said the three-month average of job growth at 173,000 jobs shows a fairly strong labor market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employment in healthcare and government, including state government employment, continued to add jobs. Leisure and hospitality added 53,000 jobs and food services and drinking places added 29,000 jobs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gould said she is keeping an eye on the employment-to-population ratio, a measure of workers employed versus the working-age population. The measure is down 0.6 percentage point over the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let&#8217;s pay attention to that and see where that goes,” she said. “We were at a pretty nice high this summer that has come down a bit.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economists will also keep an eye on demographic data changes in the next jobs report. The unemployment rate for Black men jumped from 5.7% to 6% and the unemployment rate for Black women increased from 4.9% to 6%. Economists and policy experts said that although they will be watching these numbers, they don’t think the higher unemployment rate for Black people will necessarily continue. The month-to-month data can be volatile and may not point to a broader trend, they said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Black unemployment rate jumped to 6.4% which is the highest since March and then looking at Black women, we saw their unemployment rate jumped to 6% which is the highest that we&#8217;ve seen in 2.5 years,” said Clara Wilson, senior policy analyst at the Groundwork Collaborative, a left-of-center economic think tank. “However, the spike in Black unemployment is something to always keep a track of because if we continue to see a rise in Black unemployment that typically is a warning signal canary in the coal mine that there could be further weakening in the labor market down the line.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retail jobs fell by 28,000, with a loss of 15,000 in general merchandise and 4,000 in electronics and appliance retailers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m not particularly concerned about it because it can be due to the fact that it was just a late Thanksgiving this year, so that holiday hiring may not have happened during the reference period in the same way,” Gould said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Average hourly earnings rose 0.4%, the same as October, and 4% over the past year. Although some economists say the Federal Reserve would like to see wages come down to help it meet its 2% target for inflation, Wilson said higher wages are an indication that workers are benefiting from the current economy. She said she’s worried that the Trump administration will undo some of the economic progress she said has been made from the Biden administration’s major legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s really important to remember that real people are behind the data and the strong labor market propels more opportunities for workers and ensures families have higher wages and that leads to a stronger economy. Policymakers should take those lessons that we&#8217;ve learned from those strong public investments and sustain that progress,” Wilson said.</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission released its long awaited <a href="https://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt598-2.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> on data centers Monday, detailing the expected soaring energy demands and large economic benefits of the industry ahead of the 2025 General Assembly session.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents and activists have been clamoring throughout the past year over  projections that energy demands could triple by 2040, which JLARC said could lead to a $37 monthly bill increase for Dominion Energy Virginia customers. But at the same time, the industry provides about $9.1 billion in annual activity to the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, Northern Virginia is the largest data center market in the world, ahead of Beijing and London.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report also presents three suggestions for the tax exemptions the state currently offers data centers. The exemptions could be “extended to maintain data growth and economic benefits, allowed to expire to slow growth and reduce energy impacts, or modified to balance those priorities,” explained Mark Gribbin, JLARC’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">chief legislative analyst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the release of the report, Youngkin, in a statement to the Mercury, signaled a desire to strengthen the industry’s presence in the state. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get serious, embrace common sense, growth, and opportunity, and keep Virginia winning,” Youngkin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report’s modeling to meet increasing energy needs includes the use of new natural gas plants, which release climate changing emissions and harmful pollutants to the surrounding community, to provide reliable power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia has a simple choice: embrace all of the above and deliver affordable, reliable, and, yes, increasingly clean baseload power to support future economic growth, while taking advantage of the billions of dollars in capital investment, high-paying jobs, and local and state tax revenues that come from data centers,” Youngkin said. “Or bend the knee to a green energy agenda and give away Virginia’s leadership position.” </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Energy </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report is in line with a recent regulatory filing from Dominion Energy stating annual increases in electric power demand would be relatively flat, if it weren’t for data centers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Modelling from E3, a third-party consultant, showed that energy demand for the state would increase from just over 10,000 gigawatt hours in 2023 to just over 30,000 gigawatt hours by 2040, if data center development didn’t have to deal with constraints, including needing energy requirements like transmission lines to be available prior to coming online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without data center development, the demand increased to about 12,500 gigawatt hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet those demands, more renewable energy facilities like solar and offshore will be needed, but so will natural gas, JLARC’s report stated, which would amount to a new plant being built every one and a half years, approximately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either meeting the full unconstrained demand, or half of it, relies on offshore wind and nuclear technology, which JLARC stated could come from the “unproven” small modular reactor technology. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The percentage of costs for those upgrades that could be borne by the data center industry will be the subject of an upcoming technical conference on Dec. 16 hosted by the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, Gribbin noted.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Water use and air pollution </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the high demand for energy for data centers is the operation of the processors, but also the cooling systems, which also draw on water, depending on the technology it uses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gribbin said there are sufficient environmental protections in place for the facilities to use the same amount of water as a large office building, or about 6.7 million gallons per year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fact of the matter is, it is still using a lot,” countered Sen. Danica Roem, D-Prince William, in an interview.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_37153" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/06/virginia-local-governments-will-now-have-to-plan-for-water-supply-regionally/sept-rapp-pic-morning/" rel="attachment wp-att-37153"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-37153" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-300x225.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-768x576.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sept-rapp-pic-morning-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The Rapidan River experiencing drought conditions in early September of 2023 (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added she’d like to provide more information to localities on water demands instead of hiding behind the shroud of “proprietary” information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Transparency has always been seen by the Virginia General Assembly, over the 400 years of the legislature’s existence, as an administrative burden as opposed to a requirement of government,” Roem said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report noted that data centers use fossil-fuel burning generators as back-up power sources, but “are a relatively small contributor to regional air pollution — in Northern Virginia, they make up less than 4 percent of regional emissions of nitrogen oxides and 0.1 percent or less of carbon monoxide and particulate matter emissions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, the diesel generators needed for backup power emitted only 7% of what they were allowed, which largely came from maintenance testing.  </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Economic</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s data center exemption totaled about $928.6 million in savings in 2023, and went primarily to the big four tech companies, Amazon Web Services, Google, Meta and Microsoft, according to JLARC. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state is competing with other “primary markets” for data centers that offer tax exemptions. Those markets include facilities that amount to about 1,600 megawatts in Hillsboro, Oregon, 1,560 in Phoenix, Arizona, 1,170 megawatts in Columbus, Ohio and 1,070 mw in Atlanta, Georgia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 74,000 jobs a year stem from the industry; about1,500 are created during construction, in the form of concrete pourers and electricians. Once in operation, data centers employ about 50 people on site with roles including site managers, IT professionals and security personnel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localities around the state have benefited from the business personal property and real estate taxes. But the variations of tax incentives to lure in data centers can offset how much revenue is given to jurisdictions, and economically distressed areas with less flat land and accessibility to transmission lines may have difficulty competing, Gribbin said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While noting the energy costs concerns, Republican Del. Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William suggested legislative action on data centers is inevitable in January.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s impossible to see nothing happen,” Lovejoy said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think pragmatically you want to have pro-economic policies and certainly there’s tax revenue here,” he added.</span></p>

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lawmakers will consider a bill in January that aims to stop unlicensed minors from operating a vehicle by charging the vehicle owner with a Class 1 misdemeanor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tammy McGee, whose son died in a 2019 car crash after an unlicensed and underage teen driver crashed the car he was in, has become an outspoken advocate for safe driving laws. She is now working with lawmakers including Del. W. Chad Green, R-York, to create accountability for parents and adults regarding driver safety for teenagers with </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB1549" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">House Bill 1549</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s another tool that law enforcement would have to hold parents responsible,” Green told the Mercury. “Maybe with this change in law, parents and adults will say, ‘hey, we’re not going to let this happen,’ and it could end up saving some lives.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/46.2-301.1/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">state law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, owners only face a penalty if they knowingly allow someone whose driver&#8217;s license, learner&#8217;s permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has been suspended or revoked to drive a vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the General Assembly and the governor approve the new bill, vehicle owners could face a one-year jail sentence and a $2,500 fine. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGee, who operates the </span><a href="https://www.connergweedo.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gweedo Memorial Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in honor of her late son, Joseph Conner Williams Guido, affectionately known as “Gweedo,&#8221; died in a car crash on Oct. 26, 2019 in York County. Since the crash, she has advocated for teen driving education in Virginia.</span></p>

(Courtesy of the Gweedo Memorial Foundation)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, the General Assembly passed a bill that she pushed to address safety in </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB1918" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">school parking lots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and another the following year requiring </span><a href="https://legacylis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=221&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=sb78" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parental involvement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in teen driver education. She also launched a </span><a href="http://www.ifyouseesomethingsaysomething.org/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to allow people to anonymously report tips about unsafe driving, illegal activities, and bullying, to name a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McGee said she hopes the momentum will carry during the short session beginning on Jan. 8 with House Bill 1549 and another bill, still to be filed, that will ensure all students have access to in-car driver education. McGee said not all school divisions offer behind-the-wheel education in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She fears that if students don’t have a behind-the-wheel education, they are likely to drive without a license if they or their families cannot afford private instruction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That gives our parents a peace of mind about the quality of education and the safety of their child when you think about these driving schools,” McGee said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Would I have been in these shoes had my son not died?” said McGee.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wouldn&#8217;t be passionate about driving and safety,” she added. “But what I do know is that what happened to me shouldn&#8217;t have happened. … My baby’s aspirations to play collegiate soccer were wiped away by an innocent act of stepping into a vehicle, and anybody should be able to hop into another vehicle and know that that teen is licensed, and that wasn&#8217;t the case.”</span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After decades of work to clean up the polluted Chesapeake Bay, the federal, state and local partners within the 64,000-mile watershed have acknowledged they won’t reach their 2025 goals. But neither are they giving up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Representatives of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Agreement, the regional partnership of states within the watershed, will gather Tuesday in Annapolis to discuss how to achieve not only those goals but new ones.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, the discussion already has included pollution reduction measures farmers can adopt, and funding for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The good news is that we’re entering this meeting with the partnership stronger than ever,” said Adam Ortiz, the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s administrator in the mid-Atlantic, who noted this will be the first meeting since 2014 with the governors from Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania in attendance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The presence of all three is an indication of the importance of the Chesapeake Bay to their states’ ecosystems — it is home to over 300 types of fish, birds, insects and plants — and economy. The Bay’s seafood industry alone is worth $3 billion a year to Virginia and Maryland, according to the </span><a href="https://www.naturalresources.virginia.gov/initiatives/chesapeake-bay/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acknowledging the shortcomings of the work so far, the Chesapeake Bay Program Beyond 2025 Steering Committee earlier this year </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/who/group/beyond-2025-steering-committee" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recommitting to the partnership and streamlining processes. It also advocated for local involvement and new approaches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Gov. Glenn Youngkin issued a four-page Executive Directive, stressing that, “Virginia is committed to being a part of the Partnership and continuing our efforts to protect the bay.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But he also wrote, “it is evident that a clearer path forward is needed.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Behind on the Bay </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After starting the partnership in 1983 with a one page document, the partnership&#8217;s work has become a complex system with the states making commitments to reach certain </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakeprogress.com/outcome-status" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">outcomes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, such as oyster abundance and water quality standards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia has met 100% of its sediment reduction targets, but only reached 80% of the reduction for nitrogen and 62% of the reduction for phosphorus. The concern is that those nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients feed harmful algal blooms and oxygen-deprived “dead zones,” that culminate with less than desired water quality standards. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, </span><a href="https://www.chesapeakebay.net/news/pressrelease/chesapeake-bay-sees-slight-improvement-in-water-quality" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">29.8%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the Bay and the tidal tributaries feeding into it were found to have met water quality standards, “below the 100% attainment necessary to support a healthy Bay ecosystem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Chesapeake Bay restoration is at a crossroads,” said Chesapeake Bay Foundation Virginia Director Chris Moore in a recent statement lauding Youngkin’s commitment to the partnership. “Virginia’s upcoming legislative session is a prime opportunity for the Commonwealth to continue our important investments in cleaner waterways and iconic living resources.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The causes</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work on the bay the past 40 years have focused on pollution reductions from the stormwater and wastewater sectors, and the agricultural community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a December 2023 meeting with the Virginia State Water Commission, Mike Rolband, the director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, reported that upgrades to </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/26062024/chesapeake-bay-program-flunked-2025-cleanup-goals/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stormwater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treatment plants, which are behind on the goals, and </span><a href="https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl/wastewater-out-front-bay-restoration" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wastewater</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> treatment plants, which are ahead of the goals, had led to a reduction of 8.2 million pounds of nitrogen and 708 pounds of phosphorus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But farmers, while making </span><a href="https://rga.lis.virginia.gov/Published/2024/RD376/PDF" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">progress</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last year, have only installed about 6,095 acres of forested buffers, or 28% of what&#8217;s needed for targets set for 2027. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41080" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:838px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41080" rel="attachment wp-att-41080"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41080" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices.jpg" alt="" width="838" height="337" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices.jpg 838w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices-300x121.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Ag-practices-768x309.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 838px) 100vw, 838px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  A chart of agricultural practices installed in Virginia. (Courtesy of Department of Conservation and Recreation).</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Martha Moore, vice president of governmental relations with the Virginia Farm Bureau, said the slow adoption rates were due to insufficient funding from the state’s cost-share program</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They got really frustrated,” said Moore of farmers who were told, “we just don’t have the money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers also were upset that they were not part of the conversation. This year that changes with the creation of a farmers advisory </span><a href="https://www.bayjournal.com/ag-and-the-bay/ag-bay-storylist/ag-to-get-greater-voice-in-chesapeake-bay-cleanup-effort/article_c9a892c2-b0b4-11ef-99da-5bf2c9855093.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">committee</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that we can’t see an acceleration of and completion of the restoration effort without the success of farmers,” Ortiz said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his directive, Youngkin acknowledges a need to verify best management practices that may be happening but not being counted, which happens because they haven’t been reevaluated in years. Moore said a survey with the Virginia Cooperative Extension will help capture those numbers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really what we want to see is the continuation and building upon where we’re seeing those successes,” said Travis Voyles, secretary of Natural and Historic Resources, in an interview. “Avoiding the hammer, but really embracing those incentive based approaches, in a voluntary manner, that are being effective.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The funding</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youngkin’s directive also calls for an evaluation of water quality improvement funds, which provide the funding for the stormwater and wastewater plant upgrades. Excess revenues for the fund are to be directed to the best management practice cost-share program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview Friday, Chris Pomeroy, an attorney with the Virginia Association of Municipal Wastewater Agencies, said funding for the wastewater sector must continue in order to maintain the reductions that have been made, calling it “the single most important thing Virginia can do.”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pomeroy said about $600 million had been appropriated so far and about $800 million is needed to complete projects underway.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41077" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;width:1783px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/img_4243/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41077" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588.jpg" alt="" width="1783" height="1122" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588.jpg 1783w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588-300x189.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588-1024x644.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588-768x483.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4243-scaled-e1733525998588-1536x967.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1783px) 100vw, 1783px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, speaks during a Joint Senate Agriculture Conservation and Natural Resources Committee and House Agriculture Chesapeake and Natural Resources Committee retreat in September. (Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the agricultural program fully funded now, Moore said, “I’m just very proud of the fact that we finally have achieved that goal. Now, I think we just have to figure out, how do we get to the end?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One potential way, according to the Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board that oversees the conservation districts around the state that administer the cost-share program, is more staffing to get the money out the door. A point the board made in a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Letter-to-Senator-Marsden-and-Delegate-Bulova-1.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to Sen. Dave Marsden, D-Fairfax, and Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Arlington, the chairs of Virginia’s natural resource and agricultural committees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The team is now deploying more resources than at any point in their history, while pay compression and uncompetitive salaries strain the Department’s ability to retain key staff,” wrote board chair Charles Newton. “The Virginia Soil and Water Conservation Board is concerned that without new investment into </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Department’s team, the agency will face more staff loss and be unable to keep pace with the growing demands for their services.”</span></p>

(Brett Kelman/KFF Health News)</p><p>KINGSPORT, Tenn. — Jerry Qualls had a heart attack in 2022 and was rushed by ambulance to Holston Valley Medical Center, where he was hospitalized for a week and kept alive by a ventilator and blood pump, according to his medical records.</p>
<p>His wife, Katherine Qualls, said his doctors offered little hope. In an interview and a written complaint to the Tennessee government, she said doctors at Holston Valley told her that her husband would not qualify for a heart transplant and shouldn’t be expected to recover.</p>
<p>Defiant, she insisted he be transferred hours away to a hospital in Nashville. Within days of leaving Holston Valley, Jerry Qualls was awake and sitting upright, his wife said, and he ultimately received a lifesaving heart transplant.</p>
<p>“How many families don’t know how to get a transfer and their loved one dies?” Katherine Qualls wrote in <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/copa/Master-PDF-of-Public-Hearing-comments.pdf" target="_blank">her complaint to the state</a>. “My husband would have been dead within a few days if I didn’t get him out when I did.”</p>
<p>Holston Valley Medical Center is a flagship of <a href="https://www.balladhealth.org/" target="_blank">Ballad Health</a>, a 20-hospital system in northeastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia that is the only option for hospital care in a large swath of Appalachia. Ballad formed six years ago when lawmakers in both states, in an effort to prevent hospital closures, <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/appalachia-ballad-health-copa-monopoly-charity-care-quality/" target="_blank">waived federal antitrust laws</a> so two rival health systems could merge. The merger created the largest state-sanctioned hospital monopoly in the nation.</p>
<p>Since then, Ballad has largely kept those hospitals open. But the monopoly has also fallen short of about three-fourths of the quality-of-care goals set by the states over the last three fiscal years, including failing to meet state benchmarks on infections, mortality, <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/ballad-health-er-wait-times-copa-monopoly-appalachia-hospitals/" target="_blank">emergency room speed</a>, and patient satisfaction, according to <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/tn/health/health-program-areas/health-planning/certificate-of-public-advantage/redir-copa/copa-reports.html" target="_blank">annual reports</a> from the Tennessee Department of Health and Ballad itself.</p>
<p>Some local residents have become wary, afraid, or unwilling to seek care at Ballad hospitals and must drive over an hour to reach other options, according to written complaints to the Tennessee government and state lawmakers, public hearing testimony, and KFF Health News interviews conducted over the past year with patients, family members, local leaders, and some officials who once publicly supported the monopoly, including a former government consultant and one state lawmaker. Many of those who submitted complaints or were interviewed allege that paper-thin staffing at Ballad hospitals and ERs is the root cause of the monopoly’s quality-of-care woes.</p>
<p>In a two-hour interview vigorously defending the company, Ballad Health CEO Alan Levine said the hospitals are rapidly recovering from a quality-of-care slump caused by COVID-19 and a subsequent rise in nursing turnover and staff shortages. These issues affected hospitals nationwide, Levine said, and were not related to the Ballad merger or the monopoly it created.</p>
<p>Levine declined to discuss specific complaints from patients. But he said that each of the complaints referenced in this article took issue with medical decisions made by doctors in Ballad hospitals — not “any policy or practice at Ballad.”</p>
<p>“I can understand if the patients, if the wife, was upset about the medical decisions they made if it turned out to be wrong,” Levine said. “But that has nothing to do with the merger, OK? That’s a completely different issue, and it happens in hospitals all over the country.”</p>
<p>In the interview with KFF Health News and in the days that followed, Levine flexed considerable connections to officials in the Tennessee government. As Levine spoke in a boardroom at Ballad’s hilltop headquarters, he was flanked by three local mayors who voiced support for the hospitals and said complaints came from a vocal minority of their constituents. Days later, Levine got two Tennessee state agency directors and a former state health commissioner to provide emails or text messages supporting statements he made during the interview.</p>
<p>Logan Grant, executive director of the Tennessee Health Facilities Commission, which processes complaints against hospitals for the state, said in a statement prompted by Levine that Ballad hospitals are “not an outlier in terms of substantiated survey findings.”</p>
<p>Joe Grandy, the mayor of Tennessee’s Washington County, where Ballad is headquartered, said most residents consider the quality of care in the area “about as good as it gets.”</p>
<figure id="attachment_41068" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41068" rel="attachment wp-att-41068"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-41068 size-large" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Getaz_02-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Getaz_02-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Getaz_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Getaz_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Getaz_02-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Getaz_02-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Brenda Getaz, a retired hospital quality-of-care professional, said she is considering moving away from her home in Johnson City, Tennessee, because she does not trust the hospitals owned by Ballad Health. (Brett Kelman/KFF Health News)</p></figure>
<p>Brenda Getaz certainly doesn’t.</p>
<p>Getaz, 76, who spent three decades as a hospital official specializing in quality standards before retiring to Washington County, said she plans to move to Atlanta if state governments do not take action to fix Ballad in the coming year. Getaz said local medical professionals she trusts have urged her to move away so she does not have to rely on Ballad for care.</p>
<p>“I’m frightened to be taken to a Ballad facility,” she said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Glimpses of government concern</h4>

	
<p>The Tennessee Department of Health, which has the most direct oversight over Ballad Health, over the past year has declined multiple interview requests to discuss the hospital monopoly. Department emails reviewed by KFF Health News, some of which were obtained through public record requests, offer glimpses of concern inside the agency.</p>
<p>Emails show the health department has attempted <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/tennessee-ballad-health-copa-hospital-monopoly-quality-of-care/" target="_blank">to hold Ballad more accountable</a> for its quality of care in closed-door negotiations and is investigating Holston Valley’s treatment of a recent heart patient after receiving detailed complaints from his family. In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25444995-ballad-alvarado-ouch-email/#document/p1" target="_blank">a 2023 email</a>, Tennessee Health Commissioner Ralph Alvarado reacted to a news story about low job satisfaction among Ballad nurses by writing: “Ouch. … What are they doing to address this?”</p>
<p>In another email from the same year, Alvarado praised an informal report submitted at a public hearing that concluded Ballad’s monopoly had caused more harm than good. The report was written by Wally Hankwitz, a retired health care executive who once led a physician management company in Kingsport. The report levied pages of criticism against Ballad’s “sub-par” performance and called for the monopoly to end.</p>
<p>“THIS <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25355986-alvarado-email-and-hankwitz-report-from-record-request" target="_blank">communication from the COPA hearing</a> is particularly good,” the health commissioner wrote to some of his staff. “Totally based on data. I would almost like to hear Ballad’s response to this.”</p>
<p>When asked to respond to the Hankwitz report, Levine said it was “full of errors” and that “no credible institution would pay attention to it.”</p>
<p>Despite concerns, Tennessee and Virginia have each year determined that the benefits of the Ballad monopoly outweigh any negative impacts, issuing stamps of approval that allow the monopoly to continue. This has occurred, at least in part, because both states grade Ballad against <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/tennessee-a-grade-ballad-health-hospital-monopoly/" target="_blank">scoring rubrics</a> that do not prioritize quality of care.</p>
<p>Larry Fitzgerald, a retired Tennessee consultant who monitored the monopoly for the state for more than five years and always <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/tn/health/health-program-areas/health-planning/certificate-of-public-advantage/redir-copa/copa-reports.html" target="_blank">gave Ballad high marks</a>, said in an interview that his hands were tied by the state’s lenient grading system, which allowed Ballad to succeed on paper even when it failed to meet the state’s quality-of-care goals.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald said he is unconvinced that the state-sanctioned monopoly had prevented any hospital closures and said the merger had “probably not” benefited local residents overall.</p>
<p>When asked where he would get medical attention if he lived in northeastern Tennessee or southwestern Virginia, Fitzgerald immediately responded, “I’m not going to a Ballad hospital.”</p>
<p>In his interview, Levine alleged Fitzgerald had “basically defrauded the state” by not raising these criticisms of Ballad in his public reports on the monopoly and said it was “irresponsible” and “obscene” to express his concerns about quality of care after retiring.</p>
<figure id="attachment_41065" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="max-width:100%;width:1024px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41065" rel="attachment wp-att-41065"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-41065 size-large" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holston-valley-medical-center-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holston-valley-medical-center-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holston-valley-medical-center-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holston-valley-medical-center-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holston-valley-medical-center-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/holston-valley-medical-center-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Holston Valley Medical Center is one of the flagship hospitals of Ballad Health, a 20-hospital system in northeastern Tennessee and southwestern Virginia that is the only option for hospital care in a large swath of Appalachia.

    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">‘Horror stories’ from Ballad patients</h4>

	
<p>Tennessee House member Bud Hulsey, <a href="https://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/legislatorinfo/member.aspx?district=H2" target="_blank">a Republican from Kingsport</a>, wrote in a 2023 letter to the state health department that he “was an avid supporter of the merger” that created Ballad but since then had become “concerned” and “saddened” by the state of the local hospitals.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Hulsey said that while his family has received excellent care from Ballad, his constituents have told him “horror stories” for years.</p>
<p>“I had people call me from the waiting room after they’ve sat there for 12 or 14 hours,” Hulsey said. “The scales have far more complaints on them than accolades.”</p>
<p>Others have soured on the monopoly, too. Joe Macione, who for years was on the board of Wellmont Health System, one of the rival companies that became Ballad, once publicly advocated for the merger.</p>
<p>In an interview, Macione said state leaders should have admitted years ago that the monopoly was a mistake.</p>
<p>“It has not worked,” said Macione, 87. “All my family knows that, if I have the time, I want to go to a highly graded hospital, either in Asheville or Knoxville.”</p>
<p>Ballad Health was created in 2018 after Tennessee and Virginia officials waived federal anti-monopoly laws and approved the nation’s biggest hospital merger, based on what’s called a <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/copa/Executed-COPA.pdf" target="_blank">Certificate of Public Advantage</a>, or COPA, agreement. Ballad is now the only option for hospital care for most of the approximately 1.1 million people in a 29-county region at the nexus of Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina.</p>
<p>In the years since, there have been multiple signs of discontent with and within Ballad hospitals. In 2019, protesters gathered daily for eight months outside Holston Valley to oppose the closure of the neonatal intensive care unit and the downgrading of a trauma center. (Ballad has said the NICU closure was <a href="https://www.balladhealth.org/saving-lives/nicu-updates" target="_blank">necessary and benefited patients</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38551609/" target="_blank">a study published this year</a> said the trauma changes saved lives.)</p>
<p>In 2020, Bristol Regional Medical Center CEO Greg Neal <a href="https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/ballad-health-brmc-ceo-resigns-after-scrubbing-in-on-procedure-performing-initial-incision-under-doctors-supervision/" target="_blank">resigned after it was discovered</a> he made the initial incision in a heart surgery despite not being a doctor, according to <a href="https://apps.health.tn.gov/DisciplinaryExclusion/boardorder/display/1606_61049_092722" target="_blank">Tennessee state records</a>. (Levine said in his interview that the resignation shows Ballad is holding employees accountable.)</p>
<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/karing-hearts-cath-lab-approved-over-ballad-opposition/" target="_blank">14 cardiologists signed a letter</a> warning of “severe limitations” in the Bristol Regional cardiac catheterization lab that were affecting patient safety and delaying procedures for weeks or months. (Ballad said in a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25293819-ballad-response-to-2024-monitor-report" target="_blank">letter to the Tennessee government</a> that it worked with the cardiologists, who it said were partly to blame, to make the lab more efficient.)</p>
<p>In 2023, Ballad Health was ranked last among 200 large health care organizations in <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/nursing-satisfaction-index/#interactive-launcher" target="_blank">an analysis of nurse satisfaction</a> published by an MIT business magazine. (Levine dismissed this analysis as unscientific.) This year, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/in_copa_comment_9-5-24_public_redacted.pdf" target="_blank">cited Ballad</a> as a cautionary tale while opposing a similar hospital merger under consideration in Indiana, and a longtime Kingsport doctor took <a href="https://www.hamlettdobson.com/obituaries/woodrow-wilson-reeves-jr" target="_blank">a parting shot at Ballad</a> in his obituary. (Ballad declined to comment on either topic.)</p>
<p>And in August, the widow of a Tennessee sheriff filed a lawsuit alleging that Ballad caused her husband’s death and intentionally understaffed hospitals “to save money.” Brenda Tester, the wife of Johnson County Sheriff Eddie Tester, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25260132-brenda-tester-lawsuit" target="_blank">alleged in that lawsuit</a> that Ballad put her husband on blood thinners and then gave him an unnecessary liver biopsy, causing “life ending internal blood loss” that led to “his cardiac arrest and ultimately his sudden death.”</p>
<p>Ballad has yet to respond to the Tester lawsuit in court. Levine said in his interview that the doctors who treated the sheriff were not employed by Ballad but merely contracted to work in its hospitals.</p>
<p>Some of Ballad’s most determined critics are family members of Anton Maki Jr., a former Holston Valley doctor who returned to the hospital as a patient in February. The family has filed complaints with multiple Tennessee agencies and the federal government and provided emails to KFF Health News showing that Tennessee is investigating Maki’s case.</p>
<p>In an interview and in those complaints, Maki’s family members allege Holston Valley gave Maki improper treatment, even though his symptoms and lab tests made it obvious that he was having a serious heart attack that required urgent attention.</p>
<p>The improper care did “permanent damage” to Maki’s heart, the family’s complaints allege. That damage required him to have a <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/medical-device-heart-lvad-fda-database-abbott-thoratec/" target="_blank">permanent mechanical heart pump</a> surgically implanted at a non-Ballad hospital, said one of his daughters, Alexandra Maki, who is a surgeon in Kentucky. She said her father died after a fall three months later while still in a weakened state.</p>
<p>Alexandra Maki said that her father had been alarmed by the Ballad monopoly for years but that she didn’t fully appreciate his warnings until she witnessed his care at Holston Valley firsthand.</p>
<p>“I filed these complaints because it is my duty as a doctor to report what I saw,” Alexandra Maki said. “That was not care. It is a facade of a hospital. It is a well-oiled death machine.”</p>

Republican and Democratic lawmakers in some two dozen states have introduced bills aimed at restricting or legalizing the practice of for-profit companies charging veterans fees for help filing disability claims — an issue that often has pitted veterans against one another. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)</p><p>For-profit consultants across the country make millions each year by charging military veterans for help in filing their disability claims with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>The practice exists in a legal loophole: It’s illegal under federal law for companies that aren’t accredited by the VA to charge veterans fees for helping file their disability claims, but there’s no criminal penalty for breaking the law. Recent attempts to regulate this for-profit shadow industry have <a href="https://pappas.house.gov/media/press-releases/bipartisan-support-grows-for-pappas-bill-to-protect-veterans-benefits-from-predatory-claim-sharks#:~:text=In%20August%202022,the%20118th%20Congress." target="_blank">stalled in Congress</a>.</p>
<p>While some state lawmakers are trying to close the loophole by filing bills to restrict the practice, they’re up against their legislative peers and a cadre of industry leaders with a stable of lobbyists who want the loophole sealed into place at the state level.</p>
<p>Three states — Maine, New Jersey and New York — passed laws in the past year cracking down on for-profit consultants. Similar bills were introduced in 17 other states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Louisiana <a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1381966" target="_blank">enacted a law</a> <a href="https://www.navr.org/2024/05/23/former-va-acting-secretary-peter-orourke-applauds-louisiana-house-of-representatives-for-voting-overwhelmingly-in-favor-of-sb-159-protecting-veterans-rights-with-the-preserving-lawful-utilization-of-s/" target="_blank">hailed</a> by the for-profit industry as a win; it allows companies to charge up to $12,500 in fees for a task that veterans service organizations such as The American Legion will do for free.</p>
<p>The issue is pitting veterans against one another.</p>
<p>“When we have organizations and companies out there like these claim sharks that are preying on our veterans and taking away their hard-earned benefits and making a profit off them, there’s something empirically wrong with that,” said Missouri Republican state Rep. Dave Griffith, a former Green Beret in the U.S. Army 8th Special Forces Group.</p>
<p>Griffith introduced <a href="https://legiscan.com/MO/text/HB1490/id/2861589" target="_blank">a bill</a> earlier this year that would impose criminal penalties on those receiving compensation for helping a veteran apply for benefits. The bill died in committee, but Griffith has refiled it for the upcoming legislative session.</p>
<p>“What’s even more disturbing to me,” said Griffith, who served in Vietnam, “is that many of these organizations are run by veterans.”</p>
<p>The for-profit consulting industry argues that veterans should have the freedom to hire whomever they want to help them navigate the VA’s plodding, glitchy application process. Disability claims currently take <a href="https://department.va.gov/pactdata/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2024/11/VA-PACT-Act-Dashboard-Issue-43-111524_Final_508.pdf" target="_blank">four or five months</a> on average to resolve, according to VA data, though some languish for <a href="https://www.vaoig.gov/reports/review/delays-occurred-some-veterans-benefits-claims-while-awaiting-decision#:~:text=some%20claims%20at%20the%20NWQ%20division%20had%20been%20awaiting%20decisions%20for%20one%20year%20or%20longer." target="_blank">a year or more</a>.</p>
<p>Some veterans have <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/05/06/lawmakers-ponder-whether-consultants-for-veteran-benefits-should-see-big-profits/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20DAV%20got%20me%20another%2030%25%20on%20the%20asbestos%2C%E2%80%9D%20Monroe%20said%2C%20%E2%80%9Cbut%20they%20weren%E2%80%99t%20going%20any%20further%20with%20it.%20Veterans%20Guardian%20got%20me%20bumped%20up%20to%2080%25%20with%20the%20depression%20caused%20by%20the%20asbestos%20%E2%80%A6%20So%20yeah%2C%20I%20didn%E2%80%99t%20want%20to%20give%20them%20that%20%248%2C000%2C%20but%20they%20earned%20it%20and%20I%20paid%20them.%20That%20was%20my%20agreement.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">reported</a> that the expense is worth it — and have chided the government for not doing a better job marketing directly to vets about how to get their benefits.</p>
<p>The companies charging exorbitant fees, industry representatives say, are just a few bad apples.</p>
<p>“The key for us is having transparent disclosures, processes and statements of fees so veterans can make informed decisions,” said Peter O’Rourke, president of the National Association for Veteran Rights, a newly formed trade association for the claims consulting industry. O’Rourke, a U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force veteran, was formerly acting secretary of Veterans Affairs during the Trump administration before he was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/there-were-times-i-didnt-have-a-lot-to-do-trump-loyalist-at-va-forced-out-after-collecting-pay-but-doing-little-work/2018/12/11/26e4704a-fcb7-11e8-ad40-cdfd0e0dd65a_story.html" target="_blank">forced out</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>O’Rourke estimated he and his team have been to 38 states to testify at committee hearings and speak with legislators.</p>
<p>“There’s a better way of doing business, and we need to have more of that discussion, versus going back in time and criminalizing what the market has been able to provide veterans,” he said.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Promises and profits</h4>

	
<p>The urgency from all sides of the issue follows Congress’ passage two years ago of the PACT Act, <a href="https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/" target="_blank">the largest expansion</a> of veterans’ benefits in generations. It offers disability-related benefits for veterans suffering from the effects of Agent Orange, toxic burn pits in recent wars and other toxic exposures over the past several decades. Under the act, millions more veterans <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/burn-pits-toxic-exposure-pact-act-veterans-affairs/" target="_blank">could qualify</a> for aid.</p>
<p>That increased funding represents a potential bonanza for private consultants who promise to help military veterans access it — for a price.</p>
<p>Veterans with a service-related disability, from cancer to asthma to depression, can apply to receive a monthly cash benefit from the government. Their checks could range from $500 to <a href="https://www.va.gov/disability/compensation-rates/veteran-rates/" target="_blank">more than $4,000 per month</a>, depending on the severity of the disability and other factors, such as their number of dependents.</p>
<p>But getting approved takes months. The claims process — sluggish and riddled with glitches, according to veterans and the VA’s own data — requires a lengthy application and detailed medical documentation.</p>
<p>Enter the private claims consultant. For a fee or a cut of a veteran’s future disability benefits — often five times what the veteran stands to receive from the VA, amounting to thousands of dollars — the consulting company promises to help smooth the process and maximize the veteran’s disability check.</p>
<p>“Veterans are often facing delays with the VA, and I can see why there’s a desire to get results. But these companies sometimes use exploitative practices and seize a big chunk of your benefits,” said Florida Democratic state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani. She partnered with Republican state Rep. Michelle Salzman, an Army veteran, to introduce a claim shark bill in the most recent legislative session. The bill died in committee, but Eskamani said they plan to continue talking with veterans and introduce a similar bill next session.</p>
<p>Since January, Republican and Democratic lawmakers in at least 17 states — from Rhode Island to Mississippi to California — have introduced bills to ban or restrict private claim consultants from profiting off veterans.</p>
<p>Most are based on the federal <a href="https://www.veterans.senate.gov/2024/3/tester-s-guard-va-benefits-act-receives-strong-support-at-final-hearing-with-veterans-service-organizations" target="_blank">GUARD Act</a>, currently stalled in Congress, which would impose penalties on unaccredited consultants who charge veterans for claims filing assistance. Organizations such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and The American Legion have been outspoken supporters of the GUARD Act and similar state efforts to rein in for-profit consultants.</p>
<p>Last year, New Jersey became the first state to make it illegal for anyone lacking VA accreditation to charge a veteran for assistance filing a disability claim. Maine and New York soon followed.</p>

<p>The VA <a href="https://www.va.gov/resources/va-accredited-representative-faqs/" target="_blank">grants accreditation</a> to attorneys, veterans service organizations and other claims agents that meet certain requirements, such as a background check and a written exam. Organizations such as the VFW and The American Legion provide their services for free, though attorneys and agents are allowed to charge fees to assist with some claims, including appeals.</p>
<p>Griffith, the Missouri legislator, modeled his bill after the New Jersey law. When he first began researching the issue, he said, he didn’t like what he saw. Often, he said, companies will charge a fee for their services equal to five times the increase of the veteran’s monthly benefit.</p>
<p>For example: A new veteran approved for 100% disability receives about $3,800 per month from the VA. For help filing that claim, a consulting company might charge a one-time fee of about $19,000.</p>
<p>In some cases, Griffith said, consultants can pocket as much as $30,000 through tactics such as holding onto a claim for months before filing so that they can take their cut from the substantial backpay that the VA eventually awards the veteran.</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Criticism and pushback</h4>

	
<p>O’Rourke said his group is in favor of some legal guardrails at the federal or state level to protect veterans from exploitation, such as setting certain limits around fees or requiring transparency in contract agreements. But, he said, private consulting should be freely available because the VA and its current accreditation process haven’t kept up with the needs of veterans.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at, after 20 years of war, a strain on our social infrastructure when it comes to how we take care of veterans,” he said, noting that the VA’s claims and appeals process is decades old, complex and cumbersome to navigate, even with accredited groups offering help. “Asking veterans to go into a system that uses a lot of their time and causes frustration … veterans are going to try to find workarounds for that.”</p>
<p>Groups including the VFW have been vocal opponents of for-profit consulting companies, urging lawmakers to take action and waging <a href="https://vfworg-cdn.azureedge.net/-/media/VFWSite/Files/PACT-Act/Dont-Feed-the-Sharks-One-Pager.pdf?v=1&amp;d=20240509T174110Z" target="_blank">public relations battles</a> against the industry. For-profit companies have been <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/07/05/veterans-disability-benefits-brian-reese-va-claims-insider/" target="_blank">investigated</a> by <a href="https://www.wbtv.com/2020/02/18/nc-company-charges-veterans-benefits-advice-they-could-get-free/#:~:text=He%20provided%20an%20email%20confirming%20his%20benefits%20had%20been%20submitted%20by%20the%20company." target="_blank">media</a> and officials in states including <a href="https://static.texastribune.org/media/files/588e1e97fd5cc96302fbb57b8a47697f/TX%20Attorney%20General%20request%20for%20information.pdf" target="_blank">Texas</a> and <a href="https://houmatimes.com/crime/ag-louisiana-company-targeting-veterans-shut-down/" target="_blank">Louisiana</a> for potentially illegal practices.</p>
<p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.vaoig.gov/sites/default/files/document/2023-10/september_2023_fraud_alert.pdf" target="_blank">VA issued a fraud alert</a>, warning veterans to avoid consultants who aren’t accredited.</p>
<p>But the industry is pushing back. One of the largest for-profit consulting companies spent more than $800,000 last year and $780,000 this year in federal lobbying efforts, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?id=D000089168" target="_blank">according to</a> data compiled by the nonprofit OpenSecrets. That included pushing for <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1822/cosponsors?s=2&amp;r=6&amp;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22plus+act%22%7D" target="_blank">a bill</a> that would make the legal loophole permanent. At the state level, representatives from some of the industry’s largest players are showing up in statehouses across the country to speak against bills.</p>
<p>“I got very close to getting my bill passed last year,” said Griffith. But claims consulting companies hired a lobbyist in Missouri, he said. “They lobbied the [House] speaker’s office and he delayed the bill.”</p>
<p>During a committee hearing, Missouri legislators heard opposition to the bill from O’Rourke, who <a href="https://veteranspolicy.org/post/florida-legislature-cracks-down-on-claim-sharks-stealing-va-benefits-from-disabled-veterans/#:~:text=In%20his%20testimony,proposed%20regulations%20public." target="_blank">also testified</a> against Eskamani and Salzman’s bill in Florida.</p>
<p>“I was surprised at the amount of money they’re willing to spend to try to keep things the way they are,” said Eskamani, who said she didn’t expect to see such a concerted effort to stop a bill in its first committee meeting.</p>
<p>In June, Louisiana <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/2024/06/07/louisiana-enacts-law-to-let-consultants-profit-off-disabled-veterans-benefit-claims/" target="_blank">quietly enacted a law</a> that will allow unregulated companies to profit from assisting veterans with their disability claims, though it caps consulting fees at $12,500. Republican Gov. Jeff Landry allowed the bill to become law without his signature. It marked an about-face for Landry: When he was the state attorney general, he worked to <a href="https://houmatimes.com/crime/ag-louisiana-company-targeting-veterans-shut-down/" target="_blank">shut down</a> the types of consulting businesses the law now explicitly allows.</p>
<p>Similar bills were introduced this year in <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1308/2024" target="_blank">Arizona</a>, <a href="https://legiscan.com/AZ/bill/SB1308/2024" target="_blank">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://legiscan.com/HI/bill/HB2225/2024" target="_blank">Hawaii</a> and <a href="https://legiscan.com/KY/bill/HB39/2024" target="_blank">Kentucky</a>, but did not pass.</p>
<p>Last month in Alabama, members of the legislative committee for the state veterans affairs department voted to work with state lawmakers on a bill to prohibit claims consultants from profiting off veterans. The issue is likely to show up again next year in state legislative sessions around the country.</p>

(Getty Images)</p><p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the less noticed features of the Virginia Way is the long-running tendency of the commonwealth’s leaders to conduct their decision-making behind closed doors. While the </span></i><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-freedom-of-information-act/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Freedom of Information Act</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presumes all government business is by default public and requires officials to justify why exceptions should be made, too many Virginia leaders in practice take the opposite stance, acting as if records are by default private and the public must prove they should be handled otherwise.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this feature, we aim to highlight the frequency with which officials around Virginia are resisting public access to records on issues large and small — and note instances when the release of information under FOIA gave the public insight into how government bodies are operating. </span></i></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Records show policy campus demonstration discussions at VCU, attorney general involvement</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, several demonstrations by university students in response to the Israel-Hamas conflict led Virginia higher education institutions to change their policies on protests and free speech, according to records obtained by </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-12-04/vcu-protests-gaza-israel-hamas-war-policy" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">VPM</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> News.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas on Israeli towns near the Gaza Strip that left over 1,200 dead, VCU Health Workers and Medical students started holding weekly vigils in November 2023, displaying posters to memorialize health care workers killed by the Israel Defense Force. It’s estimated that over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military attacks in Gaza since then, </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-one-year-anniversary-cf123f95609051e8e8eaf6aebe661b6a" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to The Associated Press.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January of this year, a VCU employee wrote the School of Medicine’s senior associate dean for DEI over concerns the posters’ “messaging itself may get worse over time,” and asked, “&#8230; do we have a clear policy of what can and can&#8217;t be posted on VCU property/ School of Medicine buildings?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no policy at the time, but the school adopted a policy in mid-February because of “pre-scheduled facilities maintenance,” ahead of an accreditation visit, a spokesperson told VPM News. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizers of the vigil say staff told them to remove the materials because of a scheduled powerwash, but emails VPM obtained show the school’s operation manager saying Jan. 30 that the wash could wait until Spring and provide time to formulate a policy. The school’s chief of staff said not to cancel the wash, though, as the wall was still under discussion with senior leaders. Records show the wash happened Feb. 15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then on April 29, hundreds of VCU students rallied  in support of Palestinians and chanted anti-war slogans, prompting a response from law enforcement, including VCU Police, city of Richmond Police and Virginia State Police.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students were told to disperse 13 minutes after police arrived, and the situation escalated quickly. “Richmond Police sprayed protesters with pepper spray, VCU Police corralled isolated protesters from the crowd and restrained them with </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-05-01/vcu-israel-palestine-protest-student-discipline-arrests" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cable ties</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” VPM News reported.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another email VPM acquired via FOIA request showed that, as tent demonstrations began appearing at universities and colleges across the country this spring, the office of Attorney General Jason Miyares wrote an email to Education Secretary Aimee Guidera on April 26, prior to the VCU rally, saying the office would “vigorously” defend Virginia schools’ authority to ban tents and take them down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/04/29/youngkin-says-no-encampments-on-virginia-campuses-supports-peaceful-protests/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">affirmed that stance </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on April 28, saying on CNN he had been working with Miyares to “make sure if there are protests, they are peaceful.” Records requests for communications between the OAG and Youngkin were not provided to VPM News because of attorney-client privilege and a “working papers” exemption. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VCU changed its policy on gatherings in the hours after the April 29 rally. Emails VPM News obtained show how edits to the policy happened, but don’t clearly state who directed the changes. The school withheld over 30 emails from the news outlet, citing attorney-client privilege and a school records exemption. </span></p>

<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Convicted former Norfolk detective still gets pension</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A former Norfolk detective who was convicted and served 10 years in federal prison for extortion and conspiracy offenses, and lying about it to the FBI, appears to still be getting his pension, records obtained by Richmond TV news station </span><a href="https://www.wric.com/news/taking-action/corrupt-ex-norfolk-detective-got-city-pension-during-prison-and-still-is-records-suggest/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WRIC </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Dec. 4, the station reported that it had requested records for any retirement benefit payments to the former detective, Robert Glenn Ford, from the month before he was sentenced in 2011 until Nov. 1. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A city FOIA analyst responded by saying the locality had 178 records of retirement pay stubs, but they were exempt from release. The number lines up with Norfolk police retirees’ monthly pension checks and the number of months the FOIA request spanned, also 178. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://www.pilotonline.com/2011/03/17/convicted-norfolk-detective-ford-pleads-indigence/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2011</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Virginian-Pilot reported Ford was making more than $3,000 a month from his pension as he appealed the federal case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ford was sentenced after being involved with several crimes that include one request to a Norfolk man convicted of murder for $10,000 in exchange for making the case go away. When he didn’t get it, according to a UVA law clinic, Ford “coerced witnesses and found unreliable snitches to build a case against an innocent man.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man Ford requested the bribe from, Kevin “Suge” Knight, was pardoned by former Gov. Ralph Nathoam, who noted that the man “was prosecuted based on the work of Norfolk Detective Glenn Ford, who used his official capacity to extort witnesses in order to yield high solvability percentages and was eventually convicted on federal charges.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to WRIC’s review of Norfolk’s code sections on the Norfolk Employees’ Retirement System, which is closed to new members, no provision exists for benefits to be revoked or forfeited following a conviction. Several Norfolk city employees are covered under the Virginia Retirement system, which does allow for the loss of benefits after a felony conviction related to their position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chairman of Norfolk’s police union told WRIC he wasn’t aware of the specific circumstances Ford fell under, but that retirees under NERS get retirement pay “no matter what happens after that.” City officials did not respond to questions from WRIC about its retirement system and records on Ford’s retirement pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ford declined to provide a comment to WRIC. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Fired Shenandoah County deputy recertified after FOIA-exempt hearing</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Criminal Justice Services Board last month </span><a href="https://www.nvdaily.com/nvdaily/state-panel-recertifies-shenandoah-county-deputy-fired-after-crash-investigation/article_26f3da07-bd2c-5ec1-8dd7-180eebbd8cfb.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recertified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a Shenandoah County sheriff’s deputy, who was fired for how he handled a drunk driving incident, in a hearing that a recently-changed FOIA law allowed to be held behind closed doors, according to the Northern Virginia Daily.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shenandoah County Sheriff Timothy Carter fired Jacob Unger earlier this year after Unger responded to an April 5 traffic crash that involved a person who Carter said appeared to be a friend of Unger’s, who drove into a barn while intoxicated, the NV Daily </span><a href="https://www.nvdaily.com/nvdaily/shenandoah-county-deputy-sheriff-fired-over-handling-of-crash/article_c82d6110-dea7-56a0-8839-9b8464115fe8.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unger had given the driver a preliminary breath test showing his blood alcohol content was above the .08 legal limit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unger’s body-worn camera footage shows him relaying that message to the driver, and then ended. Unger gave the driver a court summons for a reckless driving violation during the response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unger used the incorrect code section on the summons, and when the driver returned to the sheriff’s office to get it corrected, the summons was “destroyed,” Carter told the NV Daily, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and no subsequent charge (was) attempted by the deputy in regard to the reckless driving charge.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 21 and after a closed door hearing, the board unanimously approved of Unger’s appeal of the decertification Carter issued. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decertification process, </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/08/statewide-police-conduct-standards-will-soon-be-enforceable-almost-two-years-after-law-passed/#:~:text=But%20the%202020%20law%2C%20which,their%20credibility%2C%20integrity%20or%20honesty."><span style="font-weight: 400;">expanded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Democratic-controlled Virginia legislature in 2020, prevents poorly performing officers from being fired and then hired by different departments. On July 1, a change to the Freedom of Information Act law allowed the board to hold the hearing privately, before coming out into a public session to take official action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It totally vindicated my client and the wrongful things that the sheriff said about him and accused him of,” said attorney David Silek, who represented Unger and said his client was punished for doing what his superior officers told him to do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carter, who disciplined Unger’s supervisor, gave no comment to the NV Daily in response to the recertification.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Loudoun County School Board vice chair still OK with no cameras during public comment</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Loudoun County School Board vice chairman is standing by his vote to turn off cameras during public comment periods at board meetings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WJLA reporter Nick Minock </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/loudoun-county-school-board-member-meeting-shut-off-camera-despite-transparency-pledge-vice-chair-arben-istref-sam-nandi-public-comments-parenst-comment-controversey" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">asked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> vice chair Arben Istrefi on Dec. 2 if he regretted his March vote, to which Ostrefi responded, “I don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think that, you know, we&#8217;re still allowing everyone to come and speak,” Istrefi answered. “I think it&#8217;s really important that we do focus on trust and transparency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="https://wjla.com/news/local/loudoun-county-public-schools-turn-off-cameras-during-public-comment-community-meetings-lcps-school-board-education-students-parents-virginia-governor-glenn-youngkin" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">March</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the school board voted 6-3 to turn off recording cameras, but keep audio, during the public comment portion of their meeting, after members of the county’s Muslim, Christian and Hindu community previously spoke out against the district&#8217;s policy on bathrooms and lockers. The policy allows students to choose which rooms they use at school based on their gender identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One member of the school board, Sumera Rashid, voted in favor of the motion to turn off the cameras to “avoid a Jerry Springer show,” and board chair Melinda Mansfield said she was “not interested in political grandstanding,” according to WJLA’s reporting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But another member, Deana Griffith, who attempted to have the cameras turned back on, disagreed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Directing a camera towards a public speaker helps capture and relay their message effectively enabling remote viewers to access the content,” Griffith said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, J.J. Singh, who won a Democratic primary for Loudoun County-based House District 26, could potentially succeed Srinivasan’s House seat. He faces Republican Ram Venkatachalam. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DLCC director Heather Williams issued a statement noting that protecting Democrats’ slim majorities will “position us to be competitive in November when the entire House of Delegates is on the ballot alongside a competitive </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/25/spanberger-and-earle-sears-tied-in-first-2025-gubernatorial-poll/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gubernatorial race</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democrats currently have a 21-19 edge in the Senate and a  51-48 lead in the House with Republican Glenn Youngkin as governor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that Virginia can be a key indicator of “what the fight ahead looks like” to build Democratic power in states amid the Republican majorities in federal government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortifying the Democratic firewall in the states has never been more important, and that work starts in Virginia,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the DLCC “spotlight” program, Srinivasan and Singh will be assisted in fundraising and can tap into DLCC experts on staff for advice or help with organizing. The group has boosted legislative candidates around the country and focuses on seats that are crucial for protecting or making majorities, said Sam Paisley, an interim communications director with DLCC. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Democratic majority can jumpstart planned constitutional amendments</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While DLCC is watching key state elections around the country for how they can support Democrats’ ability to balance out federal GOP majorities, Virginia’s Democratic majorities will be a key part of advancing planned amendments to the state’s constitution.</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="j6PDqB758w"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/">Va.

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. House panel advances amendments on abortion rights, marriage equality and voting rights&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/embed/#?secret=SmIsD8zngc#?secret=j6PDqB758w" data-secret="j6PDqB758w" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The amendments would enshrine abortion access protections into the constitution, remove a prohibition on same-sex marriage from it, and create an automatic process for formerly incarcerated people with felony convictions to have their rights restored. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia is the least-restrictive Southern state when it comes to abortion access. The matter was paramount in the 2023 state legislative elections as Democrats vowed to protect current law (and eventually enshrine it into the constitution) and many Republicans coalesced around a 15-week cap on most abortions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under current Virginia law, any abortion occurring in the third trimester requires approval from three doctors. The new amendment would reduce that threshold to one doctor, should a later stage abortion be deemed necessary to protect the life or mental health of the pregnant person or should their fetus be deemed not viable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With no national definition of fetal viability — which refers to the likelihood of a fetus being able to survive outside of the womb — doctors typically make the determination on a case-by-case basis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Virginia, people with felony convictions are all but permanently disenfranchised from various rights, even after they’ve completed prison sentences. Previous governors’ administrations had streamlined a restoration process. Then Youngkin’s administration made it petition-based with unclear criteria. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That meant that hundreds of applicants this year were rejected — and therefore </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/23/these-virginians-wont-be-able-to-vote-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unable to vote </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in presidential and congressional elections — without knowing why. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This amendment creates a process that is bound by transparent rules and criteria that will apply equally to everybody,” the bill’s sponsor Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria said last month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the third amendment would allow Virginia to continue recognizing same-sex marriages should federal protections be undone, as they were with abortion protections. Since a 2006 amendment, </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article1/section15-A/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s constitution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defines marriage between a man and a woman. Though it’s been rendered moot since a 2015 Supreme Court of the United States decision, some lawmakers and LGBTQ advocates have stressed the importance of removing the prohibition in case that precedent were to fall (as Supreme Court judge Clarence Thomas has </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/dem-lawmakers-want-to-put-same-sex-marriage-in-virginia-s-constitution/article_46aa7008-ab32-11ee-af3d-e79f1e61bf21.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">expressed interest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in revisiting). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a Democrat-led panel was able to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/13/va-house-panel-advances-amendments-on-abortion-rights-marriage-equality-and-voting-rights/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">advance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all three amendments earlier this month, the marriage equality one saw bipartisan support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Placing these policies into the constitution would make them less subject to partisan shifts in the legislature or governors’ mansion — but it’s also a longer process than just passing one law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Constitutional amendments have to clear both chambers of the legislature two years in a row, with a House of Delegates election in between. From there, they can appear as ballot referendums for voters around the state to approve or reject. This means voters could weigh in by November 2026 — if the proposals pass in 2025 and earlier in 2026. </span></p>

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)</p><p>Jill Norton, an education policy adviser in Massachusetts, has a teenage son with dyslexia and ADHD. Shelley Scruggs, an electrical engineer in the same state, also has a teenage son with ADHD. Both students go to the same technical high school.</p>
<p>But this fall, Norton and Scruggs advocated on opposite sides of a Massachusetts ballot referendum scrapping the requirement that high school kids pass a standardized state test to graduate.</p>
<p>Norton argued that without the high bar of the standard exam, kids like hers won’t have an incentive to strive. But Scruggs maintained that kids with learning disorders also need different types of measurements than standardized tests to qualify for a high school diploma.</p>
<p>Voters last month approved the referendum, 59% to 41%, ending the Massachusetts requirement. There and in most other states, Scruggs’ position against testing is carrying the day.</p>
<p>Just seven states now require students to pass a test to graduate, and one of those — New York — will end its Regents Exam as a requirement by the 2027-28 school year. Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas and Virginia still require testing to graduate, according to the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, a group that opposes such mandates.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, teachers unions favored getting rid of the exam as a graduation requirement. They argued it forced them to teach certain facts at the expense of in-depth or more practical learning. But many business leaders were in favor of keeping the test, arguing that without it, they will have no guarantee that job applicants with high school diplomas possess basic skills.</p>
<p>State by state, graduation tests have tumbled over the past decade. In 2012, half the states required the tests, but that number fell to 13 states in 2019, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/why-the-pioneers-of-high-school-exit-exams-are-rolling-them-back/2024/11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Education Week</a>. The trend accelerated during the pandemic, when many school districts scrapped the tests during remote learning and some decided to permanently extend test exemptions.</p>
<p>Studies have found that such graduation exams disadvantage students with learning disabilities as well as English language learners, and that they aren’t always a good predictor of success in careers or higher education.</p>
<p>An oft-cited 2010 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654310383147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin may have ignited the trend to scrap the tests. Researchers’ review of 46 earlier studies found that high school exit exams “produced few of the expected benefits and have been associated with costs for the most disadvantaged students.”</p>
<p>Some states began to find other ways to assess high school competency, such as grades in mandatory courses, capstone projects or technical milestones.</p>
<p>“Minimum competency tests in the 1980s drove the idea that we need to make sure that students who graduate from high school have the bare minimum of skills,” said John Papay, an associate professor of education at Brown University. “By the mid-2000s, there was a reaction against standardized testing and a movement away from these exams. They disappeared during the pandemic and that led to these tests going away.”</p>
<p>Despite the problems with the tests for English learners and students with learning disabilities, Papay said, the tests are “strong predictors of long-term outcomes. Students who do better on the tests go on to graduate [from] college and they earn more.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Computer programs monitor students’ every word in the name of safety” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/10/17/computer-programs-monitor-students-every-word-in-the-name-of-safety/embed/#?secret=vOFYyjUPWZ#?secret=k9h6MYFY5j" width="500" height="461" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="k9h6MYFY5j" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Papay, who remains neutral on whether the tests should be required, pointed out that high school students usually have many opportunities to retake the tests and to appeal their scores.</p>
<p>Anne Hyslop, director of policy development at All4Ed, a think tank and advocacy group for underserved communities, noted that in many states, the testing requirements were replaced by other measures.</p>
<p>The schools “still require some students or all students to demonstrate competency to graduate, but students have many more options on how they could do that. They can pass a dual credit [high school/college] course, pass industry recognized competency tests. …</p>
<p>“A lot of states still have assessments as part of their graduation requirements, but in a much broader form,” she said.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Massachusetts moves</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Scruggs said her son took Massachusetts’ required exam last spring; he passed the science and math portions but fell 1 point short in English.</p>
<p>“He could do well in his classes, but if he didn’t pass the three tests, he wouldn’t get his regular diploma,” Scruggs said. “How do you go out into the working world, and you went to school every day and passed your classes, but got no diploma?”</p>
<p>Her son has taken the English test again and is awaiting his new score, she said.</p>
<p>Norton, by contrast, said the exam, called the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS, gave her son an incentive to work hard.</p>
<p>“I worry that kids like him … are going to end up graduating from high school without the skills they will need,” Norton said. “Without the test, they will just be passed along. I can’t just trust that my kid is getting the basic level of what he needs. I need a bar set where he will get the level of education he needs.”</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“Hotter August days push some schools to delay start dates” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/09/10/hotter-august-days-push-some-schools-to-delay-start-dates/embed/#?secret=SY9VDiJCCX#?secret=5ZZuwVgqug" width="500" height="327" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="5ZZuwVgqug" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Students in Massachusetts still will have to take the MCAS in their sophomore year of high school, and the scores will be used to assess their overall learning. But failing the test won’t be a barrier to graduation beginning with the class of 2025. The state is still debating how — or whether — to replace the MCAS with other types of required courses, evaluations or measurements.</p>
<p>High school students in Massachusetts and most states still have to satisfy other graduation requirements, which usually include four years of English and a number of other core subjects such as mathematics, sciences and social studies. Those requirements vary widely across the country, however, as most are set by individual school districts.</p>
<p>In New York, the State Education Department in 2019 began a multiyear process of rethinking high school graduation requirements and the Regents Exam. The department decided last month to phase out the exit exam and replace it with something called a “Portrait of a Graduate,” including seven areas of study in which a student must establish proficiency. Credit options include capstone projects, work-based learning experiences and internships, as well as academic achievement. Several other states have moved recently to a similar approach.</p>
<p>Harry Feder, executive director of FairTest, an advocacy group that works to limit standardized testing, said course grades do a better job of assessing students’ abilities.</p>
<p>“Standardized tests are poor ways of incentivizing and measuring the kinds of skills and knowledge we should have high school kids focusing on,” Feder said. “You get ‘teaching to the test’ that doesn’t bear much of a relationship to the kinds of things that kids are being asked to do when they go on to college or the workplace.”</p>
<p>Max Page, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association union, said phrases such as “teaching to the test” disrespect teachers and their ability to know when students have mastered content and competency. The high school tests are first taken in the 10th grade in Massachusetts. If the kids don’t pass, they can retake the exam in the 11th or 12th grade.</p>
<p>“Educators are still evaluating students,” he said. “It’s a mirage to say that everything that a student does in education can be measured by a standardized test in the 10th grade. Education, of course, goes through the 12th grade.”</p>
<p>He added that course grades are still a good predictor of how much a student knows.</p>
<h4 class="editorialSubhed">    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Colorado’s menu</h4>

	</h4>
<p>Several of the experts and groups on both sides of the debate point to Colorado as a blueprint for how to move away from graduation test requirements.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" title="“When ‘universal’ pre-K really isn’t: Barriers to participating abound” — Stateline" src="https://stateline.org/2024/07/03/when-universal-pre-k-really-isnt-barriers-to-participating-abound/embed/#?secret=TCuvlpDPUy#?secret=EjJmLrWSjh" width="500" height="440" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" sandbox="allow-scripts" data-secret="EjJmLrWSjh" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></p>
<p>Colorado, which made the switch with the graduating class of 2021, now allows school districts to choose from a menu of assessment techniques, such as SAT or ACT scores, or demonstration of workforce readiness in various skill areas.</p>
<p>A state task force created by the legislature recently <a href="https://www.cde.state.co.us/communications/11-8-24-news-release-1241-task-force" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended some changes</a> to the education accreditation system to “better reflect diverse student needs and smaller school populations.” They include creating assessments that adapt to student needs, offering multilingual options, and providing quicker results to understand student progress.</p>
<p>The state hopes the menu of assessment options will support local flexibility, said Danielle Ongart, assistant commissioner for student pathways and engagement at the Colorado Department of Education.</p>
<p>“Depending on what the student wants for themselves, they have the ability to show what they know,” she said in an interview. In particular, she said, the menu allows for industry certificates, if a student knows what type of work they want to do. That includes areas such as computer science or quantum computing.</p>
<p>“It allows students to better understand themselves and explain what they can do, what they are good at, and what they want to do,” she said.</p>

(VCU Capital News Service)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Metropolitan area leaders favor considering a regional revenue source for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro), which faced financial challenges to maintain services at the start of the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, where the funding will come from and the amount each jurisdiction will contribute to the fund is a concern regional leaders expressed at a joint meeting in the District of Columbia on Monday. Some of the potential funding mechanisms include collecting taxes from regional sales, motor fuel, vehicles and property.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff McKay, chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, said he and others support a uniform revenue collection system, but flexibility should be a consideration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we come up with a regional system … in terms of uniform, that doesn’t necessarily conclude in my mind that the rate has to be exactly the same everywhere,” said McKay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday’s discussion on developing a regional Metro funding source was part of a months-long effort to collaborate through an initiative known as DMVMoves, led by Metro and the Council of Governments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group also reviewed proposed scenarios that would maintain existing service levels and keep Metro efficient, reliable and consistent with repairs and maintenance throughout parts of Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Leaders also broached the idea of going beyond the current services by modernizing assets and expanding to support other initiatives including investing in a bus rapid transit network. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How a regional funding source would work</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro receives support from ridership and fare revenue. The transit agency also receives contributions from the District of Columbia, Maryland and Northern Virginia — members of the </span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/compacts/washington-metropolitan-area-transit-authority-compact-of-1966/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WMATA Compact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leaders in the District of Columbia and others, like McKay, said a uniform approach across the region would make it easier for Metro to forecast predicted revenue streams instead of relying on some localities from Northern Virginia and the three jurisdictions to pay their contributions separately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, under the proposed plan, some jurisdictions that utilize the service would be excluded from contributing to the regional funding source because they are not members of the WMATA Compact. Virginia’se Prince William County and the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park would be left out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McKay didn’t mention any jurisdictions by name, but said data shows those localities outside the compact have a “tremendous” benefit in Metro ridership. He said region leaders should begin considering speaking with those jurisdictions about getting involved with financial planning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s time we start talking to the other jurisdictions that benefit [from] Metro and trying to understand how they can be a part of this moving forward, because the idea that some suburban sprawl that has been created outside of the Metro compact area that feeds into the system — and at the end of that system is a county that has a station that&#8217;s paying for those people to ride the system exclusively — doesn&#8217;t really seem to be equitable in the long term either,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Montgomery County (Maryland) Executive Marc Elrich, said the challenge moving forward with a regional sales tax is determining the appropriate amount from each jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am pretty much opposed to doing anything that lands on the residents,” Elrich said. “I think these taxes have to focus on commercial property.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He commended Virginia and its jurisdictions in the compact on a “stunningly good job” to leverage the “myriad of taxes” to contribute to Metro, which he said is backed by a strong tax base primarily around commercial property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nick Donohue, principal at Capitol Transportation Consulting and one of two experts supporting the task force, provided </span><a href="https://dmvmoves.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/DMVMoves_TaskForce_Dec_ReadAhead-1.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">details</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about the potential funding scenarios to region leaders on Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Scenario 1, Metro would receive an increase of $480 million per year from the region to sustain existing services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An additional $120 million would help to enhance service and grow ridership under Scenario 2. Costs would likely increase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actions beyond the initial scenarios to modernize Metro — such as adding new railcars, maximizing services and expanding to move more people with bus rapid transit lines, ferry services and bike share — would require additional funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donohue said the figures are subject to change and are based on assumptions for future inflation, project costs, regional ridership growth and sustained commitments from funding jurisdictions.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Reconciling a regional vision, addressing funding shortfalls</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September, advisory groups associated with the task force reported that more than 80% of people surveyed in the National Capital Region said they “support more and better transit services, even if it requires higher investment by the region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the discussion centered on developing a regional funding source, Michael Sargent, Deputy Secretary of Transportation, said he was unclear and frustrated because the task force skipped directly to funding and passed over discussing its regional vision and funding inefficiencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we don&#8217;t have an ultimate goal, I can&#8217;t evaluate how any of these steps are going to get us there, and whether that&#8217;s a good use of funding in time, or if that&#8217;s not even gonna get us close to where we&#8217;re trying to go,” Sargent said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said the group needs an explanation of why other metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, are getting more ridership and more service for less funding, as well as the reasoning for the difference in Metro’s capital needs estimates. Sargent said Metro </span><a href="https://dmvmoves.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/092324-readahead.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it needed $2.1 billion per year to keep the system on track in its 10-year capital plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sargent said if members of the task force come to Virginia lawmakers without looking more closely at costs or providing evidence of need alongside estimates, and ask, &#8220;to raise taxes by hundreds of millions of dollars a year,” the success of the plan won’t be likely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean, that&#8217;s not just going to be a ‘no,’ that&#8217;s going to be a ‘hell no,’&#8221; Sargent said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donohue said he appreciated Sargent raising the issues facing the task force and added that the group has discussed “a lot” about the vision. He expects more discussions and answers to be provided at future meetings that will continue in January as costs are still being vetted. The task force is expected to adopt recommendations in March and the final plan in June.</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, has been frustrated by large investment firms purchasing homes in Virginia. Both in </span><a href="https://x.com/GlenSturtevant/status/1860751697703739745" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">posts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on social media and in a Zoom call open to the public and press on Wednesday, he outlined some policy proposals that he hopes can help with affordable housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, he laid out his legislative efforts to reign in investment firms. After an unsuccessful </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/SB693" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attempt </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in 2024, he said that he’s reworking his bill for the 2025 session. If passed, it would prohibit investment firms worth more than $50 million from purchasing homes. Similar ideas have </span><a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2024/01/05/hedge-fund-rental-housing-home-affordable-representative-adam-smith-congress-" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been introduced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">in Congress and other state legislatures, so Sturtevant wants to try it in Virginia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is intended to target the big Wall Street investors, not your mom-and-pop investors who buy a home and flip it or who have a duplex under management,” he said.</span></p>

Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, in 2019. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mostly, he hopes it can help people who are struggling to afford a home, particularly first-time homebuyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A meeting attendee named Holly Dougherty wrote in the group chat that her adult children are losing out on homebuying opportunities to investors with cash offers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There needs to be a way to keep young families in the community,” she said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturtevant said that anecdotally, it’s been a “nightmare” for “millennials and older Gen Zers who are coming out of school and trying to buy their first home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to data from </span><a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/investor-home-purchases-q2-2024/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redfin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that confirms a spike in investment firms purchasing homes. Investors bought one out of every six homes in the nation and one out of every four low-priced homes that sold in the second quarter of this year. Single-family homes made up nearly 70% of their purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sturtevant also pointed out how investment firms can sit on properties rather than redeveloping them or selling them, with a team of people analyzing the best moment they can sell for the highest price, despite having an advantage over individual buyers when acquiring the property in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s ultimately not fair for them to be competing with regular people,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other legislation Sturtevant wants to spearhead would allow homebuyers to inherit a seller’s mortgage and its rate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An example of where people could see immediate benefit through that measure, he said, are people who were able to purchase a home or refinance their home during lower rates when the COVID-19 pandemic was surging. A new buyer could inherit that benefit if the law were to pass. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And finally, he said he is exploring ways to incentivize companies in the commonwealth to offer down payment assistance to employees. He said that the idea is to benefit both young employees who may lack the cash for down payments while also nurturing workforce development and keeping people in Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And while Sturtevant is still fine-tuning his proposals with Virginia’s Division of Legislative Services — legal experts that assist lawmakers in drafting legislation — he stressed that the laws are only part of broader solutions when it comes to the state’s affordable housing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Saxman, a former state delegate who hosted the Zoom call, noted how “everybody seems to be having housing issues these days.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Housing was a prominent topic in this year’s local and federal elections. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris (who </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/how-kamala-harris-new-policy-plan-could-impact-housing-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">offered </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a downpayment assistance proposal) and President-elect Donald Trump talked about the nation’s housing needs during their campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though housing is typically addressed at the local level, in Wednesday’s Zoom Saxman and Sturtevant reflected on ways state and federal governments can help with supply and affordability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saxman said that he thinks Sturtevant’s bills might be hard to vote against, especially with the House of Delegates up for election in 2025. His ideas will first need to clear the Senate before review by the House and approval from the governor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who chairs the Housing Commission, welcomes Sturtevant’s intended work in addressing housing issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she stressed that Republicans have not always been on board with supporting other efforts to boost affordable housing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Accessible and affordable housing has been at the forefront of the Democratic agenda for decades, (with) proposals often thwarted by our Republican colleagues,” she said. “That was never more evident than during the housing crisis in the 2009-2010 time frame and during the eviction crisis. Many voted against the budget that included funding for the Housing Trust Fund.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locke said that she is “glad to know some finally understand this is a serious problem.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have put forward measures this year to address housing challenges in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield and Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield carried a proposal called “5,000 Families,” which would provide rental relief to certain families with school-age children to prevent displacement during academic years. Though it did not pass this year, housing groups have their </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/virginia-housing-groups-look-ahead-to-2025-for-legislative-funding-solutions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eye on it</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for next session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sen. Jeremy McPike’s Senate Bill 597 would have </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/bill-to-boost-affordable-housing-advances-to-youngkin/article_33e7b884-dd8e-11ee-96af-a7e0399a77a3.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">allowed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more local governments to utilize federal housing tax credits to encourage the development of additional affordable housing — typically associated with ranges of an area’s median income. The bill cleared both chambers before being vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both proposals may resurface in the next legislative session beginning in January, and Sturtevant will try again on his investment firm bill. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legislature was able to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/10/these-new-housing-laws-will-take-effect-next-month/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approve a series of housing reforms </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">this year. Some support renters, while another bill established a workgroup that can explore future </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/25/virginia-considering-future-building-code-updates-that-could-help-with-infill-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building code changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another successful bill was aimed at protecting existing mobile home parks — a vulnerable but affordable type of housing for which residents own their homes, but not the land beneath it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gov. Youngkin also recently issued </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/workforce-housing-directive-to-bolster-economic-development-and-new-home-construction-in-virginia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a directive </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to invest up to $75 million towards localities that want to bolster housing supply tied to new job creation over the next five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This isn’t partisan stuff,” Saxman said. </span></p>

The seven story boutique establishment features 64 rooms, over 2,000 square feet of meeting space, a rooftop bar and a restaurant, and is located in a historic district of the city. (Laura Visioni)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vacant since the 1970s, Hotel Petersburg is about to make the comeback of the year when it reopens its doors on December 5. It’s the latest sign of progress for a city long beleaguered by economic woes and government dysfunction but that has in recent years mounted a rebound campaign aided by state funds and buoyed by lawmakers’ and residents’ efforts towards Petersburg’s revival. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First opened in 1904 as the Shirley Hotel before it expanded and became </span><a href="https://thehotelpetersburg.com/history/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hotel Petersburg in 1916</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the building was once a social centerpiece in the city – holding dances, entertaining traveling businessmen, and hosting luncheons for women’s clubs. Evidence of the building’s storied past is laid out via photos and newspaper clippings on the </span><a href="https://thehotelpetersburg.com/history/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hotel’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and depict it as “a great hub for the community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This was the place to be,&#8221; said Paul Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of Retro Hospitality, the management company running the hotel. His group was also behind Richmond’s Quirk Hotel. “These buildings have a great story and a history.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But starting in the late 1960s and through the early 70s, a series of fires permanently closed the hotel. The city attempted to purchase the building in 1975 with a goal of renovating it into a new city hall, but the hotel remained closed until Dr. </span>Nat Cuthbert<b>,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a native who works as a diagnostic radiologist, bought it in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought that it had potential as apartments, and that would have been far, far easier than a boutique hotel,” said Cuthbert. “But the city didn&#8217;t really want to go in that direction. The mayor convinced me that a hotel would be a good use.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mayor Sam Parham said a boutique hotel is long overdue in the city.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It took over $23 million to get that old Petersburg Hotel renovated and back open,” said Parham. “It&#8217;s part of us growing our tourism base here and having a place for people to come and visit and spend the weekend in Petersburg.”</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41048" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41048" rel="attachment wp-att-41048"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-41048 size-full" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Laura-Visioni_lobby-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Laura-Visioni_lobby-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Laura-Visioni_lobby-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Laura-Visioni_lobby-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Laura-Visioni_lobby-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Laura-Visioni_lobby-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Laura-Visioni_lobby-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  The lobby of the Hotel Petersburg. (Laura Visioni)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hotel boasts 64 rooms, over 2,000 feet of meeting space, a rooftop lounge and full-scale restaurant. It has been deemed a member of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historic Hotels of America program, overseen by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boosting tourism is one of Petersburg’s big goals. Rich with Revolutionary and Civil War battlefields, and with an upcoming focus on highlighting the contributions of Black residents by transforming the McKenney Library into an African American history museum, plus the upcoming multi-use Fall Line Trail and a future casino in the works, Petersburg is positioning itself to rake in more tourism dollars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Petersburg probably owns more tourist attractions than most localities,” says Joanne Williams, the city’s director of communications, tourism, marketing and government relations. “We actually own Blandford Church, which is our number one historic attraction,” Williams said, in reference to an 18th century house of worship that became a prominent Civil War-era landmark. “We own Center Hill Museum,” Williams added, a historic mansion that hosted three American presidents and was featured in Steven Spielberg’s 2012 feature film “Lincoln,” much of which was shot in Petersburg.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city also owns the Exchange Building, Union Station and the Southside Depot, which is undergoing a $3 million renovation and will become the locality’s main visitor center. Citing a 2009 study by the National Park Service, Williams said the depot transformation could attract about 40,000 visitors to the city.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Hotel renovation funding, Partnership for Petersburg contribution</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hotel renovation project received a total capital investment of $23 million through the Commonwealth of Virginia’s Tourism Development Financing Program, which helps finance large scale programs, according to a Governor’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/october/name-1035837-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">press release</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Another $2.2 million in gap financing is also coming through the Virginia Tourism Corporation as well as a loan through the Virginia Small Business Financing Authority. The hotel is expected to net a $</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">675,000 tax benefit in its first full year of operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That financing was made possible by Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s </span><a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2022/august/name-938765-en.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partnership for Petersburg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an unusual and extensive collaboration between the state and local governments that has been a major catalyst of the city’s renewal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parham said Youngkin’s administration helped the city secure the Virginia Tourism Corporation grants, which city leaders had tried and failed to receive previously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For so many years, the VTC would tell us, ‘We&#8217;re not sure if Petersburg is a sound investment. We&#8217;re not sure if it will work,’” said Parham.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Partnership for Petersburg initiative, which started two years ago, sought to bring what the governor called a “holistic approach” to helping reinvigorate the city by focusing on improving schools, healthcare and getting major businesses to open. The Partnership also helped the city win a variety of grants and private funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have given us so many of the necessary resources for us to push the city of Petersburg out of a lot of the challenges that we&#8217;ve been having to get development started,” said Parham. “[The] Hotel Petersburg lay dormant for 50 years and for so long, we weren&#8217;t able to get the necessary funding to pull off a development of this magnitude.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program has helped the city land roughly $81 million dollars total, according to the Governor’s press secretary Christian Martinez. That figure does not include a private commitment of $100 million for the new Sycamore Grove development, which will be a mixed-use development featuring the city’s first full-line grocery store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve never seen a governor try to do as much to help Petersburg help itself as this administration has,” said hotel owner Cuthbert. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rebirth of the hotel comes at a time when the entire city is also experiencing a renewal and an influx of growth. Many pharmaceutical manufacturing businesses, such as the recently opened </span><a href="https://www.phlow-usa.com/u-s-facilities/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phlow</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, have made the city home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other advances the city is seeing include a bump in access to healthcare for residents, with a mobile healthcare unit, a </span><a href="https://urbanbabybeginnings.org/about-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maternal health hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and a planned </span><a href="https://www.progress-index.com/story/news/2024/07/22/richmond-firm-wants-kidney-vascular-center-in-downtown-petersburg/74475049007/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">medical treatment center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Plus, a recent multimodal </span><a href="https://doyledickersonterrazzo.com/projects/transportation/petersburg-multi-modal-transit-center/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transit center </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">has opened and the city’s financing possibilities were just improved with a <a href="https://virginiamercury.com/briefs/sp-upgrades-petersburgs-bond-rating-to-aa-reflecting-financial-resurgence/">boost in its bond rating</a> on the S&amp;P Global Ratings scale, which allows the city to seek more government bonds because they are now being seen as reliable when paying them back</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Renewed vision for the city </h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More than 33,000 people call Petersburg home, with the majority identifying as Black or African American, according to the most recent </span><a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Petersburg_city,_Virginia?g=050XX00US51730#race-and-ethnicity" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">United States Census</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Poverty has been a persistent challenge, with a </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/VA,petersburgcityvirginia/SBO050217" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poverty rate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> hovering at 22.2%, more than double Virginia’s poverty rate of 10.2%. And income levels aren’t as high as the rest of the state: While Virginia’s </span><a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Petersburg_city,_Virginia?g=050XX00US51730#income-and-poverty" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">median income level</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is $89,931, Petersburg’s comes in at $46,930. </span></p>
<figure id="attachment_41042" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="max-width:100%;width:2560px;"><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/?attachment_id=41042" rel="attachment wp-att-41042"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-41042" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Downtown-img_9880_53187660548_o-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Downtown-img_9880_53187660548_o-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Downtown-img_9880_53187660548_o-300x169.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Downtown-img_9880_53187660548_o-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Downtown-img_9880_53187660548_o-768x432.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Downtown-img_9880_53187660548_o-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Downtown-img_9880_53187660548_o-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i>  Downtown Petersburg, Virginia (courtesy city of Petersburg)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Petersburg also recently ranked as one the </span><a href="https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/health-data/virginia/petersburg-city?year=2024" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">least healthy cities</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the state and nation, according to County Health Rankings &amp; Roadmaps. The city has been associated with high rates of violent crime, according to statistics by the </span><a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Federal Bureau of Investigation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but overall, violent crime has decreased over the last decade. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past several years, developer Dave McCormick — a former Richmond resident — has bought and redeveloped old buildings in the downtown area, turning them into loft apartments, opening Demolition Coffee and starting Trapezium Brewery. He acknowledged Petersburg’s checkered past but said it shouldn’t define its future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every city has these issues. But in my experience, none of that is true. It&#8217;s a beautiful, amazing place to be downtown,” McCormick said. The revival of the city’s namesake hotel aids Petersburg’s evolution, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The brand of Petersburg will start to change and it&#8217;ll stop being that narrative about all the bad things happening. It&#8217;ll start to really be about all the good things happening.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All the growth and focus on Petersburg has given longtime resident James C. Davenport more hope for an area of Virginia that he says isn’t always shown in a positive light. He lives in the city’s historic district and served as president of the Historic Petersburg Foundation in 1986. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The hotel is a beautiful success indicator,” Davenport said, adding that he hopes Petersburg’s momentum will attract new residents. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have gone through a lot of things that other cities (have) recently gone through. We should be a champion on telling people how to survive with very little. Because we did it.”</span></p>

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — The decade-long endeavor to move the Federal Bureau of Investigation out of its crumbling headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., and into a new facility outside the city could face roadblocks next year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">President-elect Donald Trump and some of his top allies in Congress have rebuked the federal agency that undertook the search for a new suburban location, ultimately deciding on Greenbelt, Maryland, over two other options.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once Trump is back in the Oval Office and the GOP controls both chambers of Congress, the funding stream for the General Services Administration to build the new facility could end.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Republican lawmakers could also require the GSA to restart the search process, change the criteria the federal agency used to select the Greenbelt location, or simply tell the agency it must construct the new headquarters in a different location. Other options <a href="https://alabamareflector.com/briefs/wsj-ohio-congressman-wants-to-move-fbi-headquarters-to-huntsville/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">floated by GOP lawmakers</a> include Alabama and somewhere inside the District of Columbia. Or they could require GSA to build the new FBI headquarters in either Springfield, Virginia, or Landover, Maryland — the other two locations considered for the new building.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the spending panel that controls GSA’s budget, told States Newsroom he believes the issue is settled, in part, because some funding has already been allocated for the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We’re going to work very hard to make sure we keep the program on track,” Van Hollen said. “I think there’s a consensus that the FBI’s current headquarters does not meet the security requirements, does not meet the other requirements. So, you know, from our perspective, a decision has been made and we will work hard to make sure it’s executed, implemented.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Construction funding</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Congress approved $200 million for the headquarters project this spring as part of a much larger government spending package.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond that, funding is less certain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Senate Appropriations Committee, controlled by Democrats, has proposed $375 million for construction in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4928/text?s=6&#038;r=7&#038;q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22van+hollen%22%7D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this year’s GSA spending bill</a>. That measure, which includes numerous other funding proposals, received bipartisan support during a committee vote. In January, control of the Senate will flip to the GOP.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP00/20240613/117435/BILLS-118-FC-AP-FY2025-AP00-FY25FSGGFullCommitteeMark.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House version of the bill</a>, drafted by Republicans, doesn’t include any funding for a new FBI headquarters and would require the GSA to send Congress “a detailed plan and timeline to support the District of Columbia based personnel by keeping the current FBI headquarters operational or identifying another Federally owned location in the District of Columbia that can serve as the FBI headquarters building.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two chambers will likely negotiate a final, bicameral version of the bill during the first few months of next year, once the GOP holds unified control of Congress and the White House. </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Trump hotel</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said during an interview he hadn’t really thought about whether his state could become the new site for the FBI headquarters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“If you just go by history, Trump didn’t want to put any money into a new FBI headquarters,” Kaine said. “He didn’t want that block that the FBI is on to be cleared and opened for a hotel that might compete with his own hotel. So four years of the Trump administration was him basically doing everything he could to stop a move and to stop funds being used for the move.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Now he may not have the same financial interest that he had back then so I bet it’s hard to say.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump owned a hotel in the old Post Office building along Pennsylvania Avenue during his first term in office, but it was later sold and is now a Waldorf Astoria. The building is about one block away from the current FBI headquarters.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, the top Democrat on the House panel that funds the GSA, told States Newsroom there’s “no doubt” the Greenbelt location “is the best site, both in terms of security and in terms of finances.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I’m going to continue to push that position,” Hoyer said. “We need to get this done for the FBI, for the American people. The building is literally falling down. And the fact that we have delayed this … is testament that we’ve escalated cost, decreased security for the federal employees at FBI, and we ought to move on. And hopefully we will.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Maryland and Virginia governors’ offices declined to comment for this article. A GSA representative, speaking on background, said the agency has submitted a report to Congress that was required by <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2471" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the spending package lawmakers approved </a>in March 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">GSA, the person said, is trying to secure “resolutions” from congressional committees before it obligates funds to buy the site or begin design and construction activities. They said this is consistent with other large-scale development projects that require congressional approval. It was not clear what those resolutions would say.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Evaluation of selection process continues</h4>
<p dir="ltr">The GSA has been under review by its inspector general for how it undertook the site selection process for more than a year, one factor that could potentially complicate things during unified Republican control of Washington.</p>
<p dir="ltr">GSA acting Inspector General Robert Erickson <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/investigation-launched-site-selection-process-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched an evaluation </a>into the agency’s process in November 2023, a few weeks after GSA <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/maryland-confirmed-pick-new-fbi-headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced its decision</a> to pick the Greenbelt, Maryland, location.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That evaluation is ongoing, and the inspector general continues “to work thoroughly and expeditiously on the project,” according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner told States Newsroom in a brief interview he’s waiting to see the inspector general’s evaluation before deciding on a path forward.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I know people thought that it might come out in the spring. It didn’t,” Warner said. “The reports we’ve got is that they’re still doing the investigating, and let’s see what that says first.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hoyer said he doesn’t expect the results of that evaluation will affect moving the FBI headquarters to Greenbelt.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“I think everything was done absolutely as it should have been,” Hoyer said. “An argument was made by both sides in public on the merits of their sites.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Debate over process</h4>
<p dir="ltr">FBI Director Christopher Wray <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fbi-director-slams-selection-process-new-hq-maryland-while-lawmakers-squabble%C2%A0%C2%A0-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also questioned the decision</a> last year, writing in a letter to employees that he and others held “concerns about the fairness and transparency in the process,” though he wrote those “concerns are not with the decision itself but with the process.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump has announced he will name Kash Patel as head of the FBI, though Wray would have to be fired or quit first. Trump has not yet named someone to lead the GSA.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Greenbelt decision brought about some bipartisanship in Congress, with House Oversight &#038; Accountability Committee Chair James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, and Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat, <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-oversight-leader-demands-probe-political-interference-fbi-hq-move%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">urging GSA to conduct a full investigation</a> into the site selection process. </p>
<p dir="ltr">The two said the most disturbing aspect to them was that then-GSA Commissioner of the Public Building Service Nina Albert “overturned the unanimous site decision of an expert panel of civil servants representing GSA and its agency client, the FBI.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Albert left that role on Oct. 13, 2023, about a month before the final decision was announced. General Services Administrator Robin Carnahan had also <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/Enclosure%201.2%20-%20N.Albert_Authorization%20Memo_7.6.21.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said two years earlier </a>Albert didn’t have a conflict of interest.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Congress created GSA in 1949 to increase the efficiency and economy of federal government operations — not least the procurement and use of property,” Comer and Connolly wrote in their letter. “To fulfill that mission, GSA must be fair and transparent in its operations. Its real estate dealings should consider only what is best for taxpayers and the Nation. It must set aside political or parochial interests.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Comer and Connolly added they were “deeply concerned that GSA’s choice of a new FBI headquarters site departed from those principles — and in doing so, failed to put taxpayers and the public interest first.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While acknowledging the findings of the inspector general report, Balmer said he plans to refute some of it as “inaccuracies.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The city’s inspector general had launched a </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/05/16/richmond-inspector-general-investigating-citys-elections-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">probe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into Balmer’s office earlier this year following allegations of nepotism and misuse of money. According to documents obtained by The Mercury through a Freedom of Information Act request, a former employee had shared unverified allegations of management issues, including “hiring family and friends,” along with questionable spending and other concerns within the office. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​​Richmond Inspector General James Osuna’s report, released Nov. 26, verified 25 of 26 allegations against Balmer’s management of the office that included improper use of city-issued purchasing cards, overspending on items, purchasing a handgun so a worker could act as an armed security guard and spending public money on alcohol. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">City officials had suspended Balmer’s purchasing card access this past summer amid the investigation and as a </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/local/government-politics/registrar-balmer-city-credit-card-investigation-elections-office/article_6be2d0e8-146b-11ef-971d-1f0b4090e555.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">records review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by The Richmond Times-Dispatch showed $70,000 in charges during 2023. The inspector general report revealed that roughly $500,000 in public funding has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/26/investigation-finds-nearly-500000-in-waste-fraud-and-abuse-in-richmond-elections-office/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">been wasted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overall. Balmer pushed back against the findings Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s (Osuna’s) report,” he said. “My rebuttal is my report. A lot of what is in the report is absolutely true, but there are things I take issue with and I want the public to know that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Balmer plans to make both a rebuttal statement and his resignation letter publicly available, he told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. He added that his rebuttal will have documentation included that should show that “it&#8217;s more like administrative mistakes” than criminal actions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the alcohol use, he said he never drank on the job. He defended the gun purchase as something he felt was necessary following a violent altercation between two employees and concerns over violence against election workers leading up to the 2024 presidential election. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When asked if there’s anything he would have done differently, Balmer said on day one of becoming registrar he would have made sure that he and his staff had training. He claimed that he was given paperwork to sign but no formal training and he relied on the assumption that more of his staff had been trained as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He said that the next registrar should have deep knowledge of city codes, and be able to pair administrative leadership with their election worker experience. </span></p>

(Ellison Orcutt/ Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The little bumblebee, considered a keystone species because of how it benefits the environment through pollination, could be getting some buzzworthy survival assistance along the Virginia and West Virginia state border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 25, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service </span><a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2024-11/seeking-public-comment-proposed-critical-habitat-rusty-patched-bumble-bee" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proposed </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">designating about 1.6 million acres of land across the country as a critical habitat for the rusty patched bumblebee. The area </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/11/26/2024-27316/endangered-and-threatened-wildlife-and-plants-designation-of-critical-habitat-for-the-rusty-patched" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">includes </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">118,603 acres in Bath and Highland counties in Virginia, and Greenbrier and Pocahontas Counties in West Virginia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rich Hatfield, a senior conservation biologist in the endangered species program at the Xerces Society, said he’s “glad the service is using this tool,” though he has some questions over the effectiveness of the designation in urban areas in mid-western parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Virginia these are the most isolated population of the rusty patched bumblebee that we know about,” Hatfield said. “Their contribution to the resilience (of the species) I don’t think can be overstated. Those populations are critically important.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">How we got here</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rusty patched bumblebee is the little black and yellow critter with a brown spot on its second abdominal segment, giving it its name, though the Queen bees are entirely yellow. The bees pollinate several plant species.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bee was common throughout midwestern and northeastern parts of the U.S., and Canada, but since the 1990s it has </span><a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/lucas-rhoads/another-court-victory-rusty-patched-bumble-bee" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about 90% of its range, or area in which it is found. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">evidence suggests the causes of the decline to be sickness and exposure to some pesticides, as well as habitat loss, small population changes and the effects of climate change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the agency added the bee to the Endangered Species Act, which requires federal agencies to determine if any permitted activity would adversely impact the species. </span></p>

		<p style="font-size:13px"><b>– Lucas Rhoads, senior attorney for pollinators and pesticides at the Natural Resources Defense Council</b></p>
	</div>
	</div>

	
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bee disrupted the building of the since-</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2020/09/08/virginias-vanishing-bee-state-works-to-save-rusty-patched-bumblebee/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">canceled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Judges in the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals yanked the permits for the project after determining the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had erred in saying it wouldn’t have a detrimental impact on the species’ survival.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, the Natural Resources Defense said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had erred again by failing to designate a critical habitat for the bee and saying such wouldn’t benefit the species. After settlements, the federal agency agreed to make a critical habitat designation by Nov. 20 of this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This decision represents a vital step forward for one of America’s most endangered pollinators,” said Lucas Rhoads, senior attorney for pollinators and pesticides at the Natural Resources Defense Council</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We cannot afford further delays in protecting high-quality habitat that can save the bee from extinction. We look forward to this proposal being finalized as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The Virginia lands</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the proposal, the bee’s protected habitat in West Virginia and Virginia consists of 11,200 acres of  private lands, 1,845 acres of Virginia-owned lands, and 105,558 acres of federal lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federally conserved lands include the Monongahela and George Washington and Jefferson National Forests. The entire 1.6 million acres overlap with habitats for other already-endangered species, USFWS said, meaning “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">little additional conservation effort is usually needed beyond what is already in place.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ellison Orcutt, the lead field zoologist for the Virginia Natural Heritage Program at the Department of Conservation and Recreation, said the proposed area in north Bath County is a known High Potential Zone, or HPZ. There, the cooler climate and lack of development from the  federally protected forested land will likely make a favorable habitat for the bees, Orcutt said. </span></p>

(Courtesy of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)</p></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DCR’s Natural Heritage Program has been working to conserve the species after its first identification in the state since the 1990s came in 2014, along with several other insects and plants, Orcutt explained. That work includes the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources creating a Wildlife Management Area in neighboring Highland County, which now hosts native wildflowers the bees favor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal notes that the Appalachian region is home to a genetically diverse variation of the bee.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though, without baseline genetic data, “it&#8217;s unclear if this distinct genetic group existed before (the bee’s) decline or if it&#8217;s emerged since 1990 or so after the decline,” said Lori Ann Burd, environmental health director with the Center for Biological Diversity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The diversity could be the result of gradual shifts in genetics from the east to the west, and the nearby bees in Indiana and Ohio are now gone, making the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Virginia bees “more easily distinct,” Burd said. At the same time, the Virginia region could also be isolated from stressors, including competition with honey bees, allowing the rusty patched bumblebees to persist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This distinct genetic population is very critical to the future of the species,” Burd also said.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “A lack of genetic diversity in the species likely made the species as a whole more susceptible to disease and other stressors. The remaining populations have persisted through the major decline in the species so they may be better able to survive into the future.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintaining and spreading that critical diversity is why Hatfield said it&#8217;s important to expand protections to additional areas outside of those that have 50 or more known bee sightings. That would create corridors for the bees to migrate in and protect bees that may live in areas but aren’t documented.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If we want the species to be able to repopulate its former range outside of areas protected as critical habitat, there needs to be corridors connecting currently unpopulated healthy habitat across the entire range,&#8221; Hatfield said.</p>

																						<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="683" src="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="" style="margin-bottom: 10px;" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY.jpg 1024w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-300x200.jpg 300w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-768x512.jpg 768w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-696x464.jpg 696w, https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pharmacist_GETTY-630x420.jpg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p style="font-size:12px;">A Publix pharmacy manager retrieves medication.  (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Southside Virginia resident Wendy Oliver’s body might be frail amid her struggle with Lupus — an autoimmune disease that has rendered her disabled — but her spirit is strong as she and her husband navigate accessing her pain medication amid national drug shortages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This (disease) is something I have to deal with, but I don&#8217;t need to deal with the uncertainty on whether I&#8217;m going to be able to acquire my medications,” she said. “That&#8217;s a stress that nobody should have to go through.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Lupus, a person’s immune system attacks healthy organs and tissues. In Oliver’s case, it has targeted her bones the most.  She had to give up a veterinarian technician career and her husband has had to be her main caregiver in recent decades. Oliver sustains her quality of life through a few 4 milligram doses of hydromorphone per day. The drug, commonly marketed as Diluadid, is a type of opioid that at a low dose, plays a key role in managing her pain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s been increasingly difficult for her to obtain in the past six months. Based near Farmville, the couple has had to place calls and make drives within hours of their home to get her medication. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress can also trigger flare ups with her disease, worsening its symptoms. Between the efforts to get medication lately and concerns about potentially igniting withdrawal symptoms should she miss doses, she’s “terrified.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated, she reached out to U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, as well as various federal agencies to relay her concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine, along with U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, might be able to help Oliver and others with new legislation they are both proposing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They introduced the </span><a href="https://www.cotton.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/cotton1204.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protecting Our Essential Medicines Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Tuesday to help address shortages in the drug supply chain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would work by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to maintain a list of the country of origin of certain critical drugs marketed in the United States. The agency would work through a task force with other federal agencies to identify drugs for which a shortage could affect people with chronic conditions, as well as those which might be critical for epidemics or pandemics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The federal agencies that would be directed into a task force are “the ones you would expect,” Kaine said, like HHS, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, the Department of Defence and Department of Homeland Security are also included, even though they are “not the ones you would necessarily see” participating in such an effort, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“(Sen. Cotton) and I are seeing this as more than just a public health thing,” Kaine said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine said that approach stems from some lessons learned amid the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, where China, as the country of origin, had to prioritize its people over whatever drug or equipment contracts it had abroad. Likewise, when he was previously the governor of Virginia, he recalled how there was a moment of concern about having enough of a drug that alleviates influenza symptoms at a time when the bird flu was looming. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new bill also builds on a recent related bipartisan and bicameral bill that included U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Prince William. The</span><a href="https://www.kaine.senate.gov/press-releases/kaine-cotton-spanberger-and-smith-introduce-bipartisan-bicameral-end-drug-shortages-act" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> End Drug Shortages Act</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> aims to improve communications between hospitals, manufacturers and pharmacies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaine used an environmental analogy to further explain that measure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We often put river monitoring gauges on rivers, and the farther upstream you put them, the sooner you know when there might be a flood downstream,” he said. “It&#8217;s really about information sharing early on, so that we can predict when there may be spikes in demand that would require more production.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a Virginia-specific note, he believes that pharmaceutical companies clustered in Richmond and Petersburg may have important roles to play in U.S. manufacturing of medicines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the new bill he introduced with Cotton hopes to address the challenges through an international lens, with a keen focus on national security and public health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we get the whole federal family around the table to do these listings of drugs — where they come from, which of these drugs would be really deleterious to public health if there were shortages  — that can give us information that might lead us to make certain decisions about production,” Kaine said. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr">The department asks schools to have well-thought-out policies on the matter, but does not dictate exactly what those policies should be. An accompanying resource for schools notes the risk social media can pose to students’ mental health.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“In this digital age, every elementary, middle, and high school should have a clear, consistent, and research-informed policy to guide the use of phones and personal devices in school,” U.S Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a written statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The evidence makes clear: there is no one-size-fits-all policy,” Cardona added, noting that “different school communities have different needs, and the nuances of this issue demand that local voices — parents, educators, and students — inform local decisions around the use of personal devices in school.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The department acknowledged the role cellphones can play in keeping parents connected to their kids, especially in emergency situations, while also highlighting the increasing evidence on the harms social media can have on youth mental health, such as sleep deprivation and depression.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Increasing state policies</h4>
<p dir="ltr">An increasing number of states and school districts have enacted policies either prohibiting or restricting students from using their cellphones in the classrooms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Across the country, schools and districts continue to grapple with how to deal with kids’ cellphone use, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/29/cell-phone-schools-bans-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half of all states</a> have sought to ban or restrict cellphone use in classrooms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of early November, at least eight states have passed statewide policies that either limit or prohibit cellphone use in the classrooms, according to <a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/a-look-at-state-efforts-to-ban-cellphones-in-schools-and-implications-for-youth-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KFF</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That includes California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia. A Minnesota law forces schools to <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/episode/2024/08/29/minnesota-now-new-school-cellphone-policy-landscape-across-minnesota-locked-pouches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopt a policy on cellphone use</a> by March 2025.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A handful of other states’ <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2024/11/01/oregon-department-of-education-offers-schools-guidance-on-limiting-student-cell-phone-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education departments</a> have issued <a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2024/10/24/alaska-joins-growing-number-of-states-considering-crackdown-on-cellphones-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policy recommendations</a> or pilot programs, while lawmakers in several more have introduced statewide legislation regarding cellphone use.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The guidance from the U.S. Education Department coincides with the release of a <a href="https://tech.ed.gov/device-policy-playbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resource</a> for education officials and local communities on adopting cellphone use policies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the playbook, Cardona points to U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy’s <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public warning</a> in 2023 on <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/prodded-fed-parents-some-congress-try-curb-kids-use-social-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social media’s effects</a> on youth mental health.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Murthy warns: “More research is needed to fully understand the impact of social media; however, the current body of evidence indicates that while social media may have benefits for some children and adolescents, there are ample indicators that social media can also have a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.” </p>

(Courtesy of Virginia Department of Transportation).</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Virginia Department of Transportation estimates that it will take about three to six months to collect debris from Hurricane Helene, the storm that took the lives of three Virginians and damaged swaths of Appalachia in the southwest region of the state, leaving behind over $4 billion in damages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The debris removal timeline is expected to be presented to the Virginia Commonwealth Transportation Board at its </span><a href="https://ctb.virginia.gov/media/ctb/agendas-and-meeting-minutes/2024/dec/CTB_Workshop_Meeting_Dec_2024.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meeting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wednesday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a methodical, route-by-route process to pick up debris, make areas safe from leaning trees/limbs, and remove mud/rock/soil resulting from slides,” said Jessica Cowardin, spokesperson for VDOT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helene made landfall in Florida on Sept. 26 before it hit Southwest Virginia Sept. 27, causing the New River to rise to 31 feet in some areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hundreds of thousands lost power, and businesses large and small suffered damage, prompting Gov. Glenn Youngkin to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/18/virginia-localities-affected-by-hurricane-helene-now-eligible-for-special-snap-benefits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">submit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the White House and Congress last month a total estimate of $4.4 billion in damages in the state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christian Martinez, press secretary for Youngkin, said the state is collaborating with federal, state, and local partners to advocate for “Virginia to receive targeted, accelerated federal support from agencies … to expedite recovery and provide the necessary assistance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOT is expecting to receive all federal reimbursement for their efforts over a period of three years, including Federal Emergency Management public assistance and Federal Highway Administration emergency relief assistance for up to 100% of the costs to respond to the storm and rebuild roadways. Some of that funding, as well as individual assistance funding, has </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/14/youngkin-urges-hurricane-helene-survivors-to-contact-officials-shares-storm-recovery-update/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">begun</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be dispersed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The storm caused an estimated 511,000 cubic yards of debris to be strewn over the region.  VDOT has picked up about 110,000 cubic yards and contractors cleaned up 6,000 cubic yards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The estimate was developed based on historical information from previous storms,” Cowardin said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state has a Debris Task Force, which includes FEMA, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management and several other federal and state agencies. Debris cleanup also consists of removing an estimated 135 acres of debris on the surface of </span><a href="https://www.nao.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/3948201/debris-removal-effort-ramps-up-at-claytor-lake-with-additional-resources/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claytor Lake.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The effort includes survey vessels, modular pontoon barges, hydraulic excavators and a 300-ton crane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier in October, FEMA </span><a href="https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20241016/federal-agencies-working-together-multimillion-dollar-mission-remove-debris" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">a “multi-million” commitment with the Army Corps and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for debris removal from both Claytor Lake and the South Holston Lake Area over the span of about four months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Debris removal on the water is inherently more complex,” said Col. Sonny Avichal, commander of USACE’s Norfolk District, in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOT will also share on Wednesday an estimated timeline of about 12 months to rebuild damaged roads and structures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of roadways and structures including bridges that needed repair peaked after the storm peaked at 414 and 99 in the immediate aftermath of Helene, respectively. Since then, seven roadways and and four structures remain to be repaired. Damaged roadways include Routes 58 and 1212 in Damascus, and the Route 725 bridge in Taylor’s Valley was also impaired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have to do what we have to do to get our students prepared for life beyond the walls of our schools,” said board president Grace Creasey, who is, like most of the board’s members, an appointee of Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that other school board members around the commonwealth have supported moving forward. Her colleague, Vice President Bill Hansen, added that the board should continue to push forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our system has to change for the benefit of our students and our families, and frankly, for our schools, which are pillars in the community, and so I really look forward to moving this process ahead,” Hansen said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Todd Reid, a spokesman for VDOE, any changes to the new accountability system would require a regulatory change by the board, which is a lengthy and involved process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the summer, the state’s board of education approved the new accountability framework, which has been in the works for two years and overhauled the existing system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new framework is intended to depict how schools are meeting all requirements set by state laws and regulations, and provide “timely” and “transparent” information on student and school performance, according to the VDOE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">VDOE doubled down on its plans Monday, and staff </span><a href="https://www.doe.virginia.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/58674" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that the agency had offered multiple training sessions for superintendents, school division leaders, and counselors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 73 participants from 55 of the total 131 school divisions have participated in two office hour sessions, which are ongoing on Wednesdays, and 40 individual technical assistance sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Nov. 8, Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration announced the launch of an additional resource, the digital Roadmap to Readiness Hub, designed to improve student and school performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our students cannot wait another year. That&#8217;s why earlier this month, Governor Youngkin took a significant step forward in addressing the needs of Virginia&#8217;s students and public schools with the release of the Roadmap to Readiness, a comprehensive online resource hub that provides parents, teachers, school leaders, and communities with a robust set of supports, resources, and transparent data to inform decision making,&#8221; said Christian Martinez, a spokesman for the governor, in a statement on Monday. &#8220;Since the start of the administration, we continue to raise expectations for every child and put systems in place that will make a measurable difference in students’ lives now, not years from now.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="64ngvob44e"><p><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/va-launches-resource-hub-to-improve-student-and-school-outcomes-amid-performance-data-questions/">Va. launches resource hub to improve student and school outcomes amid performance data questions</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted"  title="&#8220;Va. launches resource hub to improve student and school outcomes amid performance data questions&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Mercury" src="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/11/va-launches-resource-hub-to-improve-student-and-school-outcomes-amid-performance-data-questions/embed/#?secret=072MQ2g8Dz#?secret=64ngvob44e" data-secret="64ngvob44e" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a Nov. 18 letter, signed by eight school board chairs from the counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun and Prince William and the cities of Alexandria, Arlington, Fairfax, Falls Church and Manassas, the group urged the administration to delay implementation of the accountability framework despite the rollout of the resource hub and the pending review by the U.S. Department of Education’s review of Virginia’s Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) plan. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The plan&#8217;s full implementation is slated to begin at the start of the next school year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be good partners with the state in our shared mission to foster the success of each and every student; however, we are concerned that school divisions have not been provided that appropriate amount of time to address the new accountability requirements the commonwealth has established,” the chairs wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The framework was established after their divisions “planned, budgeted and staffed” for the current school year and students had already selected their courses, the chairs wrote.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a quarter of the school year passed, the chairs said that many of the framework’s measures “have still not yet been fully defined,” and that detailed modeling has not been shared with school divisions. The chairs also said Virginia has not identified the types of support it will provide to schools needing improvement and secured the necessary related funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chairs recommended the state education board “reinstate student knowledge growth and alternative measurement alongside mastery as key framework components.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also recommended the department clearly explain and test all the components of the framework’s calculations, and clarify and publicly vet the components and intent of any agreement that will be required for low-performing schools or school divisions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter urged the board to prioritize an immediate increase in appropriated funding for any school identified as “Off Track” or “In Need of Support,” as well as for comprehensive professional development related to the new framework for all school divisions based on their actual number of instructional full-time employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the accountability system, schools are given one of four labels based on their performance: “Distinguished,” “On track,” “Off Track,” and “Needs Intensive Support.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schools considered “distinguished” are those that exceed the state’s expectations for growth, achievement and readiness, while those that need “intensive support” do not meet any of the state’s expectations. In addition, “on-track” and “off-track” descriptors indicate whether schools are generally meeting expectations or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the board’s work session on Monday, the Virginia Education Association, the largest organization representing teachers and school employees, published a </span><a href="https://www.veanea.org/performance-framework-exposed-see-the-data-and-why-it-matters/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">webpage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stating the system is a “problem” and suggesting lawmakers could delay the implementation through legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Virginia’s families, educators, and students deserve an accountability system that supports growth and improvement – not one that stigmatizes schools without addressing the root causes of their challenges,” VEA said in a statement. “We urge lawmakers to act swiftly in 2025 to delay this system and lay the groundwork for an approach that works for everyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Board member Anne Holton, former Virginia Secretary of Education, said it&#8217;s helpful that staff is providing tools to help educators and school staff get up to speed on how to put the new standards into practice, but providing a clear explanation of the process is also key for school boards and parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am absolutely confident they have asked for a delay because they want to do the very best by all of our students and because they want to be able to support their teachers,” Holton said. “They may see that differently than you, but it&#8217;s not because they want to cover up problems. They are in the field every day trying to get the very best education to all of our kids, and I have complete confidence in our school division leaders as to their motivation, whether or not they agree with you as to the mechanics of how we implement all of this.”</span></p>

(Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Democratic leaders in the General Assembly are aligned on one thing, it’s their enthusiasm for bringing more data centers to the commonwealth. Where they part ways is in how to provide enough electricity to power them. Youngkin and most Republican legislators advocate for an “all of the above” approach that includes fossil gas as well as renewables; Democrats are committed to staying the course on the transition to zero-carbon energy, with a near-term emphasis on low-cost solar. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data centers are making the transition harder, but so is local resistance to building solar. General Assembly members mostly understand the connection, leading to a lively debate in last year’s legislative session over whether to override some local permit denials for solar projects – and if so, how to ensure the localities still have some say. Though none of the legislative proposals moved forward last year, the topic has become a central one for the recently revamped Commission on Electric Utility Regulation (CEUR). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, the General Assembly is likely to consider legislation to override local solar permit denials in some cases, such as last year’s </span><a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/bill-details/20251/HB636" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HB636</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Del. Rip Sullivan, D-Fairfax, or another approach that would break the solar logjam. It remains to be seen, however,  whether legislators will take any action on data centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem has grown only more urgent as localities have continued to approve new data center proposals with little thought given to where and how they will get the power to serve them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ann Bennett, Sierra Club Virginia’s data center chair, has been tracking data center permit applications across the state. She counts at least two dozen Virginia counties with data centers under development, including rural areas far outside the industry’s stronghold in suburban Northern Virginia. By Bennett’s calculation, data centers existing and under development in Virginia will consume at least 100,000 acres. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even as local governments woo data centers, many have become hostile to solar development. A </span><a href="https://apps.dlas.virginia.gov/User_db/frmView.aspx?ViewId=6339&amp;s=7" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">presentation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia, which tracks solar permitting across Virginia, shows that far more local permits for solar facilities have been denied or withdrawn than were approved this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, county boards that approve data center development also reject permits for solar farms. Sometimes, it happens even at the same meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an effort to understand this paradox, I watched footage from two county board meetings in Hanover County, one in March of this year and the other in September. At the March meeting, county supervisors </span><a href="https://www.hanovercounty.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=770" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 1,200-acre data center complex for an area north of Ashland. Later the same night, they denied a permit for a utility-scale solar project. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parcels of land slated to be developed for the data center complex “included wooded areas, recently-logged areas, open fields, wetlands, ponds and stream corridors.” The developer plans to build about 30 data centers on the property, each 110 feet tall (about 10 stories), with setbacks from the property line ranging from 150 to 250 feet. The complex will require 700,000 gallons per day of cooling water. When fully developed, the data centers are expected to total a staggering 2,400 megawatts (MW) of power capacity, not far short of what </span><a href="https://dgtlinfra.com/data-centers-virginia-ashburn-loudoun/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">all of Loudoun County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had in 2022. There was no discussion of where so much electricity would come from. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public testimony was overwhelmingly negative. The objections echoed those that have been widely reported in </span><a href="https://www.insidenova.com/headlines/digital-gateway-data-center-opposition-escalates-in-prince-william-county/article_61124a3a-e506-11ed-8485-a77c6d7e7ff1.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">response</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to projects such as the Prince William Digital Gateway: noise, light, a massive increase in truck traffic, secrecy surrounding the project, air pollution from diesel back-up generators. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet the Hanover supervisors voted unanimously in favor of the project. It came down to money: the developer promised a tax benefit to the county over 20 years of $1.8 billion, plus upfront cash for road improvements and a $100,000 donation to a park. Supervisor Jeff Stoneman, who represents the Beaverdam district where the complex will be located, acknowledged his constituents’ concerns but noted that the revenue would be a “game-changer for this community.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even for me, as thoroughly aware as I am of all the downsides of data center sprawl, the negative impacts on communities, the risks to our water and energy security, the possibility that folks will be left with nothing but regrets – well, I just have to say: It’s really hard to argue with $1.8 billion. Rural leaders see Loudoun County </span><a href="https://www.loudounnow.com/news/business-leaders-tout-data-center-benefits-at-chamber-forum/article_f5148f4e-491f-11ef-acc5-a36d8b4e0299.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raking in revenue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from data centers, letting it cut taxes for everyone else. Why wouldn’t they want in on that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I noted before, though, there was no discussion of how or where the enormous amount of electricity needed to power the data centers would be generated. This disconnect was underscored later in the same meeting when the supervisors voted to reject a 20 MW solar project on 100 acres of a 315-acre site, in the same district as the data center complex they had just approved. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was especially hard to understand the denial of this particular permit. Supervisors agreed the project met all the terms of the county’s solar ordinance, including provisions for the use of native grasses and pollinator plants. Most of the property would remain untouched. The county would receive an upfront cash contribution of $438,600, in addition to the increased tax revenue from the project. The planning commission had recommended approval. No one testified against it; a number of people, including the farmer across the street, testified in its favor.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the discussion of the project focused on screening the solar panels from view. Supervisors fussed that the trees to be planted at the entrance were too small, and worried that some of the existing mature trees along the road might die off over time and not be replaced. The developer agreed to put larger trees at the entrance, and even to walk the perimeter annually to monitor the health of the trees, and replace any if they needed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was no use. Two of the supervisors wanted to approve the project, but they were outvoted. Stoneman, the Beaverdam supervisor who had led the way in supporting the data center complex, said he worried that erosion might impair the creek on the property, in spite of ample natural buffers, and said he did not have a “comfort level” with the project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, the county’s </span><a href="https://www.hanovercounty.gov/DocumentCenter/View/10092/Ord-23-14-Solar-Energy-Facilities" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar ordinance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, adopted in 2023, was irrelevant, or at least, misleading. Such objective standards make a developer think it will be worth their while to put in months of planning, public outreach, and working with county staff. But then it turns out that what actually matters is whether a supervisor can achieve a certain undefined “comfort level.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six months after the approval of the 2,400 MW data center complex and the denial of the 20 MW solar facility, another solar project </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-09-26/hanover-county-beaverdam-solar-farm-strata-clean-energy-jeff-stoneman" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">met the same fate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, again with Stoneman making the motion to deny the permit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time the project would take up 250 acres of a 1,500-acre site and produce 72 MW of electricity, achieved through stacking the panels to a double height. Again, the project more than met the requirements of the county solar ordinance. The land was described as currently consisting of managed pine forest, already subject to being cut over at any time, and fully 70% of the property would be preserved for conservation. Native grasses would be planted, and sheep would do most of the vegetation management. The shepherd, Marcus Gray of </span><a href="https://grayslambscaping.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gray’s Lambscaping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, attended the hearing to describe the sheep operations he runs successfully at other solar sites. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approval of the project would earn the county roughly $1.7 million upfront, and $300,000 in annual tax revenue. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supervisors praised the developer for “a really good application” that “respected” the ordinance and the environment, for the company’s willingness to listen and respond to concerns, and for agreeing to build stormwater basins and sacrifice buildable space in favor of conservation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several members of the public testified in favor of the project, but this time there were also opponents. Some of them repeated common </span><a href="https://energysolutions-solar.com/busting-renewable-energy-myths/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">myths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about solar panel toxicity and the risk of fires. One woman stated flatly, and obviously incorrectly, that it was not possible to raise sheep at a solar farm because they would die from the heat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supervisors themselves did not appear ill-informed or misinformed, though one expressed surprise that Gray could successfully sell his lamb at farmers markets when buyers knew where they had been raised. (Watching, I could only laugh, because I’ve always thought of the solar-sheep synergy as a great selling point for climate-conscious carnivores.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concern raised most often was the risk of impacts to the nearby North Anna River, though the developer had agreed to shrink the project to accommodate a much greater setback from the river than required. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, however, Supervisor Stoneman’s argument for denying the permit rested on a different argument. He praised the developer for doing a good job, and noted the project was in accordance with all requirements. But, he said, “Beaverdam is just a different place.” People take pride in the rural character and forest and farmland. Our job, he noted, is to protect the trees that are harvested on the site currently, something “that is as important as the power.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Money is not the most important thing,” concluded the man who led the cheering squad for a data center complex in his district six months earlier.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two supervisors who had supported the smaller solar facility that had been rejected in March made their best arguments for this project as well, though they ultimately voted with Stoneman as the home supervisor. One said she supported solar “because I’m pro-farm,” and solar is a way to preserve farmland from development. The other noted that the land would certainly be developed one way or another, and the results would almost certainly be worse. Maintaining rural culture is important, he noted, but “we are approving residential development and seeing by-right development that people don’t want either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also warned his colleagues, as he had in the spring, that rejecting good solar projects was going to result in legislation that would take away local authority and give it to the unelected State Corporation Commission. He said he would go along with Stoneman’s motion to deny the permit because “I assume he knows something,” but he made it clear he considered it the wrong decision, and a dangerous one for local autonomy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidently, he had been paying attention to the conversation at the General Assembly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, my sympathies lie wholeheartedly with people whose instincts are to protect the woods and fields around them. I share the one Hanover supervisor’s belief that solar is a means to preserve land from permanent development and even improve soil health and wildlife habitat, but I also understand it may be years before some people see sheep grazing under solar panels as a welcome feature in their landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I get how a rural county, having sold a little bit of its soul for $1.8 billion, might then slam the door to other development, even after applicants had worked with the county for months in good faith and done everything asked for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a choice I’d make – I’d take solar over data centers every time – but then, no one made it the county’s responsibility to contribute electricity to the grid that serves it, much less to produce the electricity needed to run the data centers it embraced.</span></p>

(Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The State Board of Elections officially certified this year’s election on Monday, affirming the results of local, congressional and national contests in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The bottom line is that we had safe and fair elections in Virginia this year,” said John O’Bannon, the chair of the board who was appointed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday’s certification solidified Vice President Kamala Harris’ win of Virginia’s 13 electoral college votes, despite her ultimate loss to Donald Trump, whose second term in the White House begins next month. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other certified elections included local contests around the state along with congressional elections and one of Virginia’s U.S. Senate seats. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia Department of Elections Commissioner Susan Beals also reported that two risk-limiting audits after the elections confirmed the wins of both Democratic U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine and U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risk-limiting audits are when random samples of hand-counted ballots are analyzed. Virginia conducts the audits after elections are complete but before they are certified each year. For anyone curious about more details of the audits, Beals said that a full report will be provided at the board’s January 2025 meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She added that two of Virginia’s upcoming special elections will occur on Jan. 7 of next year — Senate District 32 and House District 26. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because Democratic Sen. Suhas Subramanyam was elected to Congress so he will vacate that seat. And, since Del. Kannan Srinivasan won a Democratic primary in hopes to replace Subramanyam in the state senate, he will vacate his House seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, a special election has yet to be officially set for Senate District 10, as Sen. John McGuire was elected to Congress but </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/25/mcguire-still-hasnt-resigned-his-state-senate-seat-weeks-after-congressional-win/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hasn’t formally resigned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from his state seat. State</span><a href="https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title24.2/chapter2/section24.2-216/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> law</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> outlines that a special election date must be set within 30 days of a vacancy or notification of it — whichever happens first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a 21-19 edge in favor of Democrats, a Republican failing to fill McGuire’s seat would give Democrats a bit more lead in the next legislative session. But Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, told The Mercury last week that he expects a special election will occur on Jan. 7. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s 2025 legislative session will begin on Jan. 8. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Virginia’s electoral board has often drawn public comment, no one offered feedback in Monday’s scarcely-attended meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citizens in Virginia and elsewhere who denied President Joe Biden’s win over Trump in 2020 have questioned electoral boards nationwide. Meanwhile, recent drama among local electoral boards around the state has</span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2022/08/17/special-prosecutor-trying-to-sort-out-elections-drama-in-nottoway-county/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sometimes spilled </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">into state electoral board meetings. Multiple Capitol Police officers have been present, as they were on Monday’s calm and procedural meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Republican Party of Virginia chairman Rich Anderson and Democratic Party of Virginia chairwoman Susan Swecker had </span><a href="https://richmond.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/state-party-leaders-show-support-for-virginias-elections/article_e68409be-92e0-11ee-a7cb-17550b97fe80.html#tncms-source=login" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">both attended</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the certification meeting of 2023’s elections to present as a unified front and shore up  trust in elections. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were not present at this year’s certification, but other members of DPVA were. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jake Rubenstein, who served as Virginia’s director for Harris’ campaign, said election deniers are “just worried about winning elections for themselves — whether that means complaining if they don&#8217;t get the results they want, or saying ‘everything is fine’ when the result is what they wanted.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He added that DPVA is “incredibly proud” of election officials around the state for carrying out their work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a text message, Anderson said the results validated “what we knew all along: that Virginian voters can have confidence that our electoral processes are safe, secure and transparent.” </span></p>

(Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opportunity for residents who want solar on their property is expanding to the Richmond and Hampton Roads area amid potential changes to how much savings Virginia&#8217;s two largest utilities will offer to customers who install panels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solar United Neighbors says participation in its co-op program to install solar panels on residential properties can be a way to hedge against larger electricity bills coming from that increase, and while using carbon-free energy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I haven&#8217;t paid Dominion Energy for (energy) consumption in almost 18 months,” said Brandon Praileau, Virginia program director for the group, who said he installed solar panels on a church he’s a pastor at earlier this decade. “The utility rate has risen … since I went solar, but I don&#8217;t see it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-op model SUN advocates for involves a period when community members join as a group to ask a solar developer to install panels on their properties. The larger ask brings the cost of installation down compared to companies needing to complete one-off projects, Praileau explained. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once 20 to 30 members sign up, the co-op will send out a request for proposals to developers, which will then be reviewed by a selection committee of a few members to determine which builder to go with. The installer pays SUN a referral fee for each member who signs up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The spring, summer and the early bit of September, October — that&#8217;s peak season time,” Praileau said. “The goal is to try to get those systems installed so that those consumers will be able to produce peak energy consumption during the peak time of solar.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the ultimate savings equation includes selling renewable energy credits created when solar energy is produced, and participating in net metering, Praileau added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Net-metering reduces the need to pull electricity from the grids’ centralized generation sources, and allows the excess energy that is produced to be sold back to the utility, with the value of that sale being credited, or netted, against a customer’s future bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Think of it like the old AT&amp;T rollover minutes. The minutes you don&#8217;t use roll over to the next month. It&#8217;s the same concept here,” Praileau said. “If you produce more energy than what you consume, that unused energy you bank is then rolled over to the next month for you to then draw back from against whatever your next month&#8217;s energy consumption is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Renewable Energy Labs, the average residential solar install is about 7.5 kilowatts. The equation saving’s answer in Virginia, Praileau said, ultimately amounts to customers getting a return on their 30-year investment on a 4 to 8 kilowatt system in about eight or nine years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What makes that eight years reasonable are the incentive tax credits around solar right now on the federal level … and if you&#8217;re in a rural area,” Praileau said, adding some localities have tax credits, too. “There might be credits for you if you&#8217;re in a disadvantaged community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the savings do come with “cost-shifting” concerns. For instance, non-solar users argue that solar users benefit from the grid for energy needs when their panels aren’t producing or when they&#8217;re selling their excess energy back to the grid. That concern has prompted Appalachian Power Company, which serves Southwest Virginia, to ask regulators to </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/09/13/appalachian-power-company-requests-reduction-to-pay-rate-for-net-metering-solar-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its payment for excess power from 16 cents per kilowatt hour to 4 cents per kilowatt hour. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appalachian’s request, Praileau said, “basically would kill the solar market and kill the solar industry, because that makes the return on investment like 30 years,” and puts an increased focus on what Dominion Energy may request with the State Corporation Commission, which regulates Virginia’s utilities, in May.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also already a cost shift happening across the entire grid, Praileau said, with new generation sources needing to be added to the grid to meet rising energy demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Who do you think is going to pay for that? The rate payer is going to pay for that,” Praileau said. “Where is the real cost shift to?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SUN began a </span><a href="https://solarunitedneighbors.org/co-ops/virginia/richmond-and-hampton-roads-fall-2024-co-op/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the Richmond and Hampton Roads area Nov. 21 and will run it until April 4. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The latest campaign comes after four previous ones in Virginia, which includes Arlington and Fairfax counties, D.C. and the Maryland counties of Howard, Montgomery and Frederick. As a result of those about 1,000 customers signed up and about 4.8 megawatts of solar has been installed leading to an investment of about $4 million, Praileau said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know that Virginia&#8217;s energy consumption is rising at a very rapid pace,” said Praileau, adding that getting more residential solar, or “distributed generation” on the grid is part of alleviating the demand. Pair that with battery storage and demand side management programs with smart meters that can adjust a home&#8217;s electricity needs to create “virtual power plants,” Praileau said, “you can add just as much capacity as you could building a peaker power plant,” which Dominion is doing to ensure grid </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/22/air-regulators-awaiting-info-for-dominions-proposed-natural-gas-plant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reliability</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those tools Praileau laid out are available as the state and municipalities have pledged to reduce fossil fuel emissions in their jurisdictions. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments set a target to have </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/11/27/d-c-region-including-nova-sets-ambitious-goal-for-rooftop-solar/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">250,000 rooftops</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> install solar. The City of Richmond has reduced the 3.5 million tons of community-wide carbon emissions in 2022 by 23% as part of its goal to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The plan includes the adoption of residential </span><a href="https://www.rva.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/FullDocumentRVAgreenClimateEquityActionPlan2030.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Three percent of the city-wide emissions are from municipal government,” said Laura Thomas,  director of the Office of Sustainability with the city of Richmond during a recent media even. “That means 97% (of reductions) need to happen out in the community.”</span></p>

(Hugh Kenny)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reelection of Donald Trump shows the continued prevalence of climate denialism, which involves a rejection of the scientific consensus that human activity is changing the climate. As in his first term, Trump will no doubt try to hold our country back in the race to slow climate change by phasing out fossil fuels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Trump’s climate denialism, survey research indicates that we in Virginia largely </span><a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that climate change is happening. And most of us understand that it is caused by our reliance on coal, oil, and natural gas. But we have our own special variety of denialism here in the commonwealth: a denial that there are limits to how much electricity we can produce for data centers without also shattering our commitment to shift away from fossil fuels. Ultimately, a transition to renewable energy will require that we slow or stop the current data center boom in order to get there.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Data center development and growing energy demand</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name “data center” sounds innocuous, but their need for energy is anything but harmless. Data centers are large warehouses stacked full of electronics that convert energy into data storage and computation, increasingly for artificial intelligence. The </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">amount of electricity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that data centers need is staggering. Just one data center can use as much power as tens of thousands of households combined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With at least </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/11/19/energy-policymakers-convene-for-virginia-clean-economy-act-summit/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">500 data centers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have been built or permitted in Virginia, along with more in the works, the state has a </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24052024/virginia-data-center-market-electricity-demand/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">higher data center density</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than anywhere else in the world. Even before the data center boom, a transition away from fossil fuels across the state to 100% renewable energy would be a daunting task. But thanks in large part to data centers, it is now much harder. Virginia is experiencing </span><a href="https://www.vpm.org/news/2024-11-14/meta-google-amazon-dominion-energy-data-centers-virginia-power-demand" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greater demand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for power than any time since World War II. Electricity consumption in the state is </span><a href="https://news.dominionenergy.com/2024-10-15-Dominion-Energy-Virginia-releases-comprehensive-long-term-plan-to-meet-growing-power-demand-with-reliable,-affordable-and-increasingly-clean-electricity" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">projected to double</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the next fifteen years. </span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The limits of green technology</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This growing energy demand cannot be met while also phasing out fossil fuels. Solar panels are an essential part of the energy transition, but they can’t do it all. For example, just one </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/cleanarc-to-develop-600mw-campus-in-caroline-county-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">600 megawatt data center</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently approved in Caroline County will use the equivalent of as much electricity as is produced in Spotsylvania County’s </span><a href="https://colonial-materials.com/portfolio/energy/spotsylvania-solar/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">solar farm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which covers 3,500 acres of land with solar arrays and is the largest solar development east of the Rocky Mountains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wind turbines have tremendous promise for electricity production, but also can’t provide a magical solution for meeting energy demand. For example, Dominion Energy is developing a 176 turbine project off of the coast of Virginia Beach. This project will produce enough electricity to meet the needs of about 600,000 homes, or just a bit more than the energy that will be required to power a single data-center mega project that is currently being developed in </span><a href="https://www.bayjournal.com/news/energy/energy-demands-for-northern-virginia-data-centers-almost-too-big-to-compute/article_d64ab388-2cb7-11ef-a753-4ffcc056f619.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hanover County</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the limits of solar and wind energy in meeting expected energy demand, Dominion Energy and Amazon Web Services — a main developer of data centers in our state — have announced </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/amazon-signs-deals-to-invest-in-nuclear-smrs-to-power-data-centers/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build small nuclear power plants as low-carbon sources of energy. But it would take dozens of these new reactors to produce enough electricity for Virginia’s data centers alone. Since nuclear power remains controversial and because many Virginians likely do not want to live next to a nuclear power plant, it is uncertain where they would all be built.</span></p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Climate denialism, Virginia style</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virginia’s style of climate denialism doesn’t dispute that fossil fuels are causing climate change. Instead, denialism in the commonwealth happens when we commit to phasing out fossil fuels but don’t have a plan to get there, and instead approve data center after data center as if there is an unlimited supply of low-carbon electricity to run them all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dominion Energy, for instance, says that it is committed to Virginia’s goal of phasing out fossil fuels, even while proposing the development of </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/10112023/dominion-peaker-plant-chesterfield-virginia/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new natural gas power plants</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Amazon Web Services stresses the importance of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, even if its CEO </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/10/17/amazon-announces-deal-with-dominion-energy-to-develop-a-small-nuclear-reactor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">admits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that he doesn’t know how it will be achieved. And local leaders, like those in my hometown of Fredericksburg, proclaim their commitment to 100% renewable energy goals without a climate plan, while also </span><a href="https://fxbgadvance.substack.com/p/fredericksburg-city-council-passes" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announcing new efforts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to attract data center development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to overcome Virginia’s special flavor of climate denialism, we must recognize that there are limits to how much energy we can produce without fueling climate change. This means there is also a limit to how many data centers that can operate as we transition away from fossil fuels. In the interest of protecting our climate, it is time for a moratorium on the approval of new data centers in our state.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last session, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and lawmakers settled on a biennium budget that included several transportation </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2024/06/04/whats-in-virginias-transportation-spending-plan/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investments</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including $1 million to establish an Advanced Air Aviation Test Site from the Commonwealth’s Development Opportunity Fund and $350,000 to study implementing “emerging technologies,” including </span><a href="https://virginiamercury.com/2023/12/22/what-would-virginia-need-for-a-future-of-electric-and-automated-aircraft/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced Air Mobility</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the significant investments, Del. Wren Williams, R-Patrick, said he decided to carry his bill that would redirect tax revenues from vehicle rentals to support aviation laws and construction, maintenance, and improvement of airports in the commonwealth in the upcoming session. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the tax revenues from vehicle rentals go from the Commonwealth Transportation Fund to the Aviation Special Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams said the revenue amount is small, but it could help the commonwealth when it has to fully fund aviation projects and match grants from the federal government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There&#8217;s always the need to help improve the infrastructure of airports and aviation in Virginia, especially with our current administration and Boeing and others that have come into Virginia as an aviation hub,” Williams said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Virginia’s heavily used airports, such as Dulles and Richmond International, receive much attention, Williams said it&#8217;s important to support smaller airports, which lack necessary facilities such as runway extensions, hangar spaces, and control towers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Williams said the bill also considers the future of uncrewed aerial vehicles and the need for dedicated infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October, aviation and economic experts briefed House and Senate Transportation Committee members about “advanced air mobility” at the state’s annual transportation conference. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced air mobility has grown in popularity as a way to offer travel and delivery services and, at the same time, promise to reduce greenhouse gases. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, because the technologies are new, regulations and infrastructure are still under development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the nonprofit group Virginia Innovation Partnership Corporation (VIPC), the advanced air mobility industry, as it is known, could generate $16 billion in new business activity in the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity is “huge,” House Transportation Committee Chair Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, told the Mercury at last month’s transportation conference, adding that it is vital for lawmakers to begin discussing now some of the regulatory considerations and incentives that will be needed “because the future is here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Campbell Jr., deputy director for the Virginia Department of Aviation, said if the bill were to become law, the money would go into the Aviation Fund, which provides funding for planning and engineering projects that focus on airport facility development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In general,” Campbell said, “these projects include master plan and airport layout plan studies; environmental studies; land acquisition; airside facility design and construction; and terminal building design and construction.”</span></p>

(Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images)</p><p>As he’s poised to leave office next month, President Joe Biden will leave a legacy of “proactive,” “nuanced” and “effective” tech policy strategy behind him, technologists across different sectors told States Newsroom.</p>
<p>Biden’s term was bookended by major issues in the tech world. When he took office in early 2021, he was faced with an economy and workforce that was struggling to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic, and longstanding issues with a digital divide across the country. As he prepares to exit the White House, federal agencies are working to incorporate the principles from the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/" target="_blank">2023 AI Bill of Rights</a>, on evolving technologies that will undoubtedly continue changing American life.</p>
<p>Though he was unable to get federal regulations on AI passed through Congress, Biden’s goal was to bring tech access to all Americans, while safeguarding against potential harms, the technologists said.</p>
<p>“I think everything that he does is foundational,” said Suriel Arellano, a longtime consultant and author on digital transformation who’s based in Los Angeles. “So it definitely sets the stage for long term innovation and regulation.”</p>
    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The digital divide</h4>

	
<p>For Arellano, Biden’s attempt to bring internet access to all families stands out as a lasting piece of the president’s legacy. Broadband internet for work, healthcare and education was a part of Biden’s<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/" target="_blank"> 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal</a>, especially targeting people in rural areas.</p>
<p>Biden earmarked $65 billion toward the project, which was dolled out to states and federal departments to establish or improve the physical infrastructure to support internet access. <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2024/09/biden-harris-administration-delivering-promise-connect-everyone-america-reliable" target="_blank">As of September</a>, more than 2.4 million previously unserved homes and businesses have been connected to the internet, and $50 billion has been given to grant programs that support these goals across the states.</p>
<p>Arellano said he thinks there’s still work to do with the physical broadband infrastructure before that promise is realized — “I think that should have come first,” he said.</p>
<p>“But I think as a legacy, I think breaching the digital divide is actually one of the strong — maybe not the strongest, but I would say it’s definitely a strong legacy that he leaves,” Arellano said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Shaping the U.S. conversation about AI</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>During Biden’s presidency, practical and responsible application of artificial intelligence became a major part of the tech conversation. The 2023 AI Bill of Rights created the White House AI Council, the creation of a framework for federal agencies to follow relating to privacy protection and a list of guidelines for securing AI workers, for navigating the effects on the labor market and for ensuring equity in AI use, among others.</p>
<p>The guidelines put forth by the administration are subtle, and “not likely to be felt by the average consumer,” said Austin-based Alex Shahrestani, an attorney and managing partner at Promise Legal, which specializes in tech and regulatory policy.</p>
<p>“It was something that’s very light touch and essentially sets up the groundwork to introduce a regulatory framework for AI providers without it being something that they’re really going to push back on,” Shahrestani said.</p>
<p>In recent months, some federal agencies have released their guidelines called for by the AI Bill of Rights, including <a href="https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/department-labor-releases-ai-best-practices-employers" target="_blank">the Department of Labor</a>, and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2024/10/03/fact-sheet-omb-issues-guidance-to-advance-the-responsible-acquisition-of-ai-in-government/" target="_blank">The Office of Management and Budget</a>, which outlines how the government will go about “responsible acquisition” of AI. It may not seem like these guidelines would affect the average consumer, Shahrestani said, but government contractors are likely to be larger companies that already have a significant commercial footprint.</p>
<p>“It sets up these companies to then follow these procedures in other contexts, so whether that’s B2B or direct-to-consumer applications, that’s like more of a trickle down sort of approach,” he said.</p>
<p>Sheena Franklin, D.C.-based founder of K’ept Health and previously a lobbyist, said Biden emphasized the ethical use and development of AI, and set a tone of fostering public trust and preventing harm with the AI Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>Franklin and Shahrestani agreed it’s possible that President-elect Donald Trump could repeal some of Biden’s executive orders on AI, but they see the Bill of Rights as a fairly light approach to regulating it.</p>
<p>“It was a really nuanced and effective approach,” Shahrestani said. “There’s some inertia building, right? Like a snowball rolling down the hill. We’re early days for the snowball, but it just got started and it will only grow to be a bigger one.”</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">The CHIPS act</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/08/09/fact-sheet-chips-and-science-act-will-lower-costs-create-jobs-strengthen-supply-chains-and-counter-china/" target="_blank">CHIPS and Science Act of 2022</a>, which aimed to strengthen domestic semiconductor manufacturing, supply chains and the innovation economy with a $53 billion investment, is a major piece of his legacy, Franklin said. The bill centered on worker and community investments, and prioritized small businesses and underrepresented communities, with a goal of economic growth in the U.S., and especially in communities that needed support.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/08/09/fact-sheet-two-years-after-the-chips-and-science-act-biden-%E2%81%A0harris-administration-celebrates-historic-achievements-in-bringing-semiconductor-supply-chains-home-creating-jobs-supporting-inn/" target="_blank">Two years after the bill was signed</a>, the federal government, in partnership with American companies, has provided funding for semiconductor manufacturing projects that created more than 100,000 jobs and workforce development programs. The U.S. is on track to produce 30% of the world’s semiconductor chips in 2032, up from 10% today.</p>
<p>“He was really trying to position the U.S. as a global leader when it came to technology, because that industry is going to continue to grow,” Franklin said.</p>
<p>It’s hard to quantify what the lasting impact of the CHIPS act will be, but one immediate factor is computing, Shahrestani said. The AI models being developed right now have infinite abilities, he said, but the computing power had previously held the industry back.</p>
<p>“Being able to provide more compute through better chips, and more sophisticated hardware is going to be a big part of what provides, and what is behind the best AI technologies,” Shahrestani said.</p>
<p><strong>    <h4 class="editorialSubhed">Accountability for Big Tech</h4>

	</strong></p>
<p>Many in the Big Tech community see Biden’s AI Bill of Rights, and its data privacy inclusions, as well as the Justice Department’s monopoly lawsuits against tech giants <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-apple-monopolizing-smartphone-markets" target="_blank">like Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies" target="_blank">Google</a>, as hampering innovation.</p>
<p>Arellano is optimistic about the technological advances and innovation that the U.S. may see under a less regulation-focused Trump presidency, but he cautions that some regulations may be needed for privacy protections.</p>
<p>“My concern is always on the public side, you know, putting the dog on a leash, and making sure that our regulations are there in place to protect the people,” he said.</p>
<p>Franklin predicts that if Biden attempts any last-minute tech policy before he leaves office, it will probably be to pursue further antitrust cases. It would align with his goal of fostering competition between startups and small businesses and reinforce his legacy of safeguarding consumer interests, she said.</p>
<p>When she considered how to describe Biden’s tech legacy, Franklin said she nearly used the word “strength,” though she said he ultimately could have done a little bit more for tech regulation. But she landed on two words: “thoughtful and proactive.”</p>
<p>“Meaning, he’s thinking about everybody’s concerns,” Franklin said. “Not just thinking about the Big Tech and not just thinking about the consumers, right? Like there has to be a balance there.”</p>

(Official White House Photo by Shealah Craighead)</p><p dir="ltr">WASHINGTON — Incoming White House budget director Russ Vought has spent much of his career learning the detailed, often convoluted mechanisms that make up the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The agency, little known outside Washington, D.C., is relatively small compared to the rest of the federal government, but it acts like a nucleus for the executive branch and holds significant power.</p>
<p dir="ltr">OMB is responsible for releasing the president’s budget request every year, but also manages much of the executive branch by overseeing departments’ performance, reviewing the vast majority of federal regulations and coordinating how the various agencies communicate with Congress. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought was deputy director, acting director and then director at OMB during Trump’s first term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Before that Vought worked as vice president of Heritage Action for America, policy director for the U.S. House Republican Conference, executive director of the Republican Study Committee and a legislative assistant for former Texas Republican Sen. Phil Gramm. He has an undergraduate degree from Wheaton College and a law degree from George Washington University Law School.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following Trump’s first term in office, Vought founded the right-leaning Center for Renewing America. The group’s mission is “to renew a consensus of America as a nation under God with unique interests worthy of defending that flow from its people, institutions, and history, where individuals’ enjoyment of freedom is predicated on just laws and healthy communities.”</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Cutting government spending</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Vought outlined his agenda for the next four years in Project 2025, a 922-page <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document</a> from the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation that led to speculation during the presidential campaign about what Trump would seek to do without Congress, including in areas that constitutionally fall within the legislative branch, like government spending.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, repeatedly tried to tie Project 2025 to Trump and his campaign, and they sought to distance themselves from its proposals. But Trump has since nominated some of its authors or contributors to run federal departments and agencies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought, in a 26-page chapter on the executive office of the president, wrote the OMB director “must ensure the appointment of a General Counsel who is respected yet creative and fearless in his or her ability to challenge legal precedents that serve to protect the status quo.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump, Vought and many others are bullish about cutting government spending, but will likely run into legal challenges if they try to spend more or considerably less than lawmakers approve in the dozen annual government funding bills. </p>
<h4 dir="ltr">Budget request</h4>
<p dir="ltr">One of Vought’s most visible responsibilities will be releasing the president’s annual budget request, a sweeping document that lays out the commander-in-chief’s proposal for the federal government’s tax and spending policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The president’s budget, however, is just a request since Congress has the constitutional authority to establish tax and spending policy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lawmakers on Capitol Hill write the dozen annual government funding bills that account for about one-third of annual federal spending. The rest of the federal government’s spending comes from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which are classified as mandatory programs and mostly run on autopilot unless Congress approves changes and the president signs off on a new law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That separation of powers led to frustration during Trump’s first term in office and will likely do so again, since he spoke during the 2024 campaign about using “impoundment” to prevent the federal government from spending money Congress has approved.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump withheld security assistance funding from Ukraine during his first term in office, leading to one of his two impeachments and a ruling from the Government Accountability Office —a nonpartisan government watchdog — that he had violated the law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,” GAO <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/b-331564.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. “OMB withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The withholding was not a programmatic delay. Therefore, we conclude that OMB violated the ICA.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trump spoke on the campaign trail about using “impoundment” to drastically cut government spending, but that would likely lead to lawsuits and a Supreme Court ruling. </p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought’s think tank, Center for Renewing America, <a href="https://americarenewing.com/the-history-of-impoundments-before-the-impoundment-control-act-of-1974/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published analysis </a>of presidents using impoundment throughout the country’s history, with the authors concluding the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional.</p>
<h4 dir="ltr">‘Every possible tool’</h4>
<p dir="ltr">Vought sought to defend the president’s budget request in his chapter in Project 2025, writing that though “some mistakenly regard it as a mere paper-pushing exercise, the President’s budget is in fact a powerful mechanism for setting and enforcing public policy at federal agencies.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He signaled the second Trump administration would be more nuanced in its interpretation of presidential authority.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The President should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government.” Vought wrote. “Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vought also wrote about the management aspect of OMB’s portfolio, pressing for political appointees to have more authority and influence than career staff.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“It is vital that the Director and his political staff, not the careerists, drive these offices in pursuit of the President’s actual priorities and not let them set their own agenda based on the wishes of the sprawling ‘good government’ management community in and outside of government,” Vought wrote. “Many Directors do not properly prioritize the management portfolio, leaving it to the Deputy for Management, but such neglect creates purposeless bureaucracy that impedes a President’s agenda—an ‘M Train to Nowhere.’”</p>

(Larry Levine / WMATA)</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (Metro)  is moving forward with a service-wide redesign of its bus routes, including in a few areas of Northern Virginia, improving where people want to travel and simplifying services by the summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The transit agency is planning to make changes in Alexandria, Fairlington and West Falls Church and Fairfax County after a two-year comprehensive review of the existing bus network called the 2025 </span><a href="https://www.wmata.com/initiatives/plans/Better-Bus/" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better Bus Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which, according to the plan, aims to “better match when and where people want to travel, provide fast, frequent and reliable service, address inequities, and increase access to opportunity for disenfranchised communities.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ultimately we ended up with a product that, I think, is going to really result in significant efficiency and savings, but also provide better service,” said Matt Letourneau, chairman of the Metro Board of Directors Finance and Capital Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letourneau, who also represents Virginia on the board that oversees transit services for Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia, said some of the changes could frustrate some travelers because a particular route may not be available, “but by and large, we think this is going to be a big win for the whole region.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Alexandria, the Better Bus Network plan proposes to preserve rush hour service in Brookville along Taney Avenue, Park Place Condominiums and South Fairlington. The proposal also consolidates and streamlines service between Shirlington and South Fairlington.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The proposal will also restore the connection to the West Falls Church Station and surrounding development in West Falls Church. In Fairfax County, the plan will maintain rush-hour service at the Fairview Park Office Complex and service along Vaden Drive to the Fairless neighborhood and the Jim Scott Community Center.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro plans to roll out the service plan by June throughout its service area in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Northern Virginia, all of which provide financial contributions to the agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro is supported by ridership and fare revenue, which has steadily increased since the pandemic when travelers stayed home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the </span><a href="https://www.wmata.com/about/board/meetings/board-pdfs/upload/3A-Approval-of-Restructuring-Metrobus-and-Metrorail-Operating-Subsidy-Allocation-Formulas-v2.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restructured Metrorail and Metrobus subsidy formula and Metro’s 2025 Approved Budget, Virginia and most of its Northern Virginia jurisdictions would see a small contribution savings under the new Better Bus Network plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Board of Directors voted to update the funding formula, which determines how much jurisdictions pay to Metro, after the agency received feedback that the current formulas are “confusing” and lack transparency and predictability.&#8221; The purpose of restructuring the formula is to “increase legibility and transparency,” “align service benefits” and &#8220;improve service and fiscal predictability.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Metro established the funding formulas in 1977 and amended them in 1995.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Letourneau said additional costs could arise as the board considers other changes to the bus network. He did not mention any changes specifically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were really focusing on data, on efficiency, on really trying to run a really good, efficient system,” Letourneau said. “I don&#8217;t necessarily think that we&#8217;re done growing the bus network. We just needed to really [create] a baseline that reflects &#8230; a new reality of where people are traveling.”</span></p>
